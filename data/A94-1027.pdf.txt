Text categorization is the classification of 
documents with respect to a set of prede- 
fined categories. In this paper, we propose 
a new probabilistic model for text catego- 
rization, that is based on a Single random 
Variable with Multiple Values (SVMV). Com- 
pared to previous probabilistic models, our 
model has the following advantages; 1) it 
considers within-document term frequencies, 
2) considers term weighting for target docu- 
ments, and 3) is less affected by having insuf- 
ficient training cases. We verify our model's 
superiority over the others in the task of cat- 
egorizing news articles from the "Wall Street 
Journal". 
1 Introduction 
Text categorization is the classification of documents 
with respect o a set of predefined categories. As an 
example, let us take a look at the following article from 
the "Wall Street Journal" (1989/11/2). 
McDermott International, Inc. said its Bab- 
cock & Wilcox unit completed the sale of its 
Bailey Controls Operations to Finmeccanica 
S.p.A for $295 million. Finmeccanica is an 
Italian state-owned holding company with in- 
terests in the mechanical engineering indus- 
try. Bailey Controls, based in Wickliffe, Ohio, 
makes computerized industrial controls sys- 
tems. It employs 2,700 people and has annual 
revenue of about $370 million. 
Two categories (topics) are manually assigned to 
this article; "TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISI- 
TIONS (TNM)" and "COMPUTERS AND INFORMA- 
TION TECHNOLOGY (CPK)." While there may be cer- 
tain rules or standards for categorization, it is very 
difficult for human experts to assign categories con- 
sistently and efficiently to large numbers of daily in- 
coming documents. The purpose of this paper is to 
propose a new probabilistic model for automatic text 
categorization.

While many text categorization models have been 
proposed so far, in this paper, we concentrate on 
the probabilistic models (Robertson and Sparck Jones, 
1976; Kwok, 1990; Fuhr, 1989; Lewis, 1992; Croft, 
1981; Wong and Yao, 1989; Yu et al., 1989) because 
these models have solid formal grounding in probabil- 
ity theory. Section 2 quickly reviews the probabilis- 
tic models and lists their individual problems. In sec- 
tion 3, we propose anew probabilistic model based on a 
Single random Variable with Multiple Values (SVMV). 
Our model is very simple, but solves some problems 
of the previous models. In section 4, we verify our 
model's superiority over the others through experi- 
ments in which we categorize "Wall Street Journal" 
articles. 
2 A Brief Survey of Probabilistic Text 
Categorization 
In this section, we will briefly review three major prob- 
abilistic models for text categorization. Originally, 
these models have been exploited for information re- 
trieval, but the adaptation to text categorization is 
straightforward. 
In a model of probabilistic text categorization, 
P(cld ) = "the probability that a document d is 
categorized into a category c" (1) 
is calculated. Usually, a set of categories i defined be- 
forehand. For every document di, probability P(cldi ) is 
calculated and all the documents are ranked in decreas- 
ing order according to their probabilities. The larger 
P(cldi) a document di has, the more probably it will 
be categorized into category c. This is called the Prob- 
abilistic Ranking Principle (PRP) (Robertson, 1977). 
Several strategies can be used to assign categories to a 
document based on PRP (Lewis, 1992). 
There are several ways to calculate P(c\[d). Three 
representatives are (Robertson and Sparck Jones, 
1976), (Kwok, 1990), and (Fuhr, 1989). 
2.1 Probabil ist lc Relevance Weighting 
(PRW) 
Robertson and Sparck Jones (1976) make use of the 
well-known logistic (or log-odds) transformation f the 
162 
probability P(c\]d). 
P(cld) 
g(cld ) = log P(~ld) (2) 
where ~ means "not c", that is "a document is not 
categorized into c." Since this is a monotonic transfor- 
mation of P(cld), PRP is still satisfied after transfor- 
mation. 
Using Bayes' theorem, Eq. (2) becomes 
P(d\]c) P(c) g(cld ) = log ~ + log p(~). (3) 
Here, P(c) is the prior probability that a document is 
categorized into c. This is estimated from given train- 
ing data, i.e., the number of documents assigned to the 
category c. P(dl c) is calculated as follows. If we as- 
sume that a document consists of a set of terms (usually 
nouns are used for the first approximation) and each 
term appears independently in a document, P(dlc ) is 
decomposed to 
P(dlc) = l-~ P(T/ = lie) l '~ P(~ = 01e) (4) 
tied tjEe-d 
where "c -  d" is a set of terms that do not appear 
in d but appear in the training cases assigned to c. 
"ti" represents the name of a term and "T/ = 1, 0" 
represents whether or not the corresponding term '2i" 
appears in a document. Therefore, P (T /= 1, 0\[c) is the 
probability that a document does or does not contain 
the term ti, given that the document is categorized into 
c. This probability is estimated from the training data; 
the number of documents that are categorized into c 
and have the term tl. Substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (3) 
yields 
P (~ = lie ) 
g(cld) = log P(T, 1re) 
tied 
P(e) + log 
+ ,--, P(Tj = 01c )\ - log 
tieZe-'Ce_d P (~ = 0l~ )
(5) 
We refer to Robertson and Sparck Jones' formulation 
as Probabilistic Relevance Weighting (PRW). 
While PRW is the first attempt to formalize well- 
known relevance weighting (Sparck Jones, 1972; Salton 
and McGill, 1983) by probability theory, there are sev- 
eral drawbacks in PRW. 
\ [P rob lem 1\] no wi th in-document  te rm fre- 
quenc ies  
PRW does not make use of within-document term 
frequencies. P(T = 1, 01c) in Eq. (5) takes into account 
only the existence/absence of the term t in a document. 
In general, frequently appearing terms in a document 
play an important role in information retrieval (Salton 
and McGill, 1983). Salton and Yang experimentally 
verified the importance of within-document term fre- 
quencies in their vector model (Salton and Yang, 1973). 
\ [Problem 2\] no term weight ing for target 
documents  
In the PRW formulation, there is no factor of term 
weighting for target documents (i.e., P(.Id)). Accord- 
ing to Eq. (5), even if a term exists in a target docu- 
ment, only the importance of the term in a category 
(i.e., P(T = lie)) is considered for overall probability. 
Term weighting for target documents would also be 
necessary for sophisticated information retrieval (Fuhr, 
1989; Kwok, 1990). 
\ [P rob lem 3\] af fected by  having insufficient 
training cases 
In practical situations, the estimation of P(T = 
1, 01c ) is not always straightforward. Let us consider 
the following case. In the training data, we are given 
R documents that are assigned to c. Among them, 
r documents have the term t. In this example, the 
straightforward estimate of P(T -- llc ) is "r/R." If 
"r = 0" (i.e., none of the documents in c has t) and 
the target document d contains the term t, g(c\[d) be- 
comes -0% which means that d is never categorized 
into c. Robertson and Sparck Jones mentioned other 
special cases like the above example (Robertson and 
Sparck Jones, 1976). A well-known remedy for this 
problem is to use "(r + 0.5)/(R + 1)" as the estimate 
of P(T = lie ) (Robertson and Sparck Jones, 1976). 
While various smoothing methods (Church and Gale, 
1991; Jelinek, 1990) are also applicable to these situa- 
tions and would be expected to work better, we used 
the simple "add one" remedy in the following experi- 
ments. 
2.2 Component  Theory  (CT)  
To solve problems 1 and 2 of PRW, Kwok (1990) 
stresses the assumption that a document consists of 
terms. This theory is called the Component Theory 
(CT). 
To introduce within-document term frequencies (i.e., 
to solve problem 1), CT assumes that a document 
is completely decomposed into its constituting terms. 
Therefore, rather than counting the number of docu- 
ments, as in PRW, CT counts the number of terms in 
a document for probability estimation. This leads to 
within-document term frequencies. Moreover, to in- 
corporate term weighting for target documents (i.e., to 
solve problem 2), CT defines g(cld ) as the geometric 
mean probabilities over components of the target doc- 
ument d; 
P(dlc) = \[YI P(TIc)\]~ 
~ P(Tl'c) J " 
Following Kwok's derivation, g(cld) becomes 
g(cld) = E P(T = tld)(log P(T - tic ) 
P(T ¢ tic) ted 
P(T ~ tl'd)~ P(c) 
log P(T -- ~-~" + log p(~). 
(6) 
+ 
(7) 
163 
For precise derivation, refer to (Kwok, 1990). 
Here, note that P(T  = rid ) and P(T  = tic ) represent 
the frequency of a term t within a target document 
d and that within a category c respectively. There- 
fore, CT is not subject to problems 1 and 2. However, 
problem 3 still affects CT. Furthermore, Fuhr (1989) 
pointed out that transformation, as in Eq. (6), is not 
monotonic of P(cld ). It follows then, that CT does not 
satisfy the probabilistic ranking principle (PRP) any 
more. 
2.3 Ret r ieva l  w i th  P robab i l i s t i c  Index ing  
(RPI) 
Fuhr (1989) solves problem 2by assuming that a doc- 
ument is probabilistically indexed by its term vectors. 
This model is called Retrieval with Probabilistie Index- 
ing (RPI). 
In RPI, a document d has a binary vector 
-- (T1, . . . ,  Tn) where each component corresponds to 
a term. 7} = 1 means that the document d contains 
the term ti. X is defined as the set of all possible in- 
dexings, where IX I = 2". Conditioning P(cld ) for each 
possible indexing gives 
P(c\[d) = Z P(cld'x)P(:rld)" (8) 
~EX 
By assuming conditional independence between c and 
d given a~ 1 , and using Bayes' theorem, Eq. (8) becomes, 
P(~lc)P(zld) 
P(cld ) = P(c) Z P (z )  (9) 
:~EX 
Assuming that each term appears independently in a 
target document d and in a document assigned to c, 
Eq. (9) is rewritten as 
1-I(P(7} = llc)P(7} = lid ) P(c\]d) = P(c) P(7} = 1) 
i 
-t P(7} = 0Ic)P(T~ = 01d)). 
P(7} -- 0) 
(lo) 
Here, all the probabilities are estimated from the train- 
ing data using the same method described in Sec- 
tion 2.1. 
Since Eq. (10) includes the factor P(T  = 1,01d) as 
well as P(T  = 1,01c), RPI takes into account term 
weighting for target documents. While this in prin- 
ciple solves problem 2, if we use a simple estimation 
method counting the number of documents which have 
a term, P(T  = 1,0\]d) reduces to 1 or 0 (i.e, binary, 
not weighted). For example, when a target docu- 
ment d has a term t, P(t  = 1\]d) = 1 and when not, 
P(T  = l id ) = 0. In the following experiments we used 
this binary estimation method, but non binary esti- 
mates could be used as in (Fuhr, 1989). 
1More precisely, P( cld , x) = P( c\[x ) which assumes that 
if we know x, information for c is independent of that for 
d. This assumption sounds valid because x is a kind of 
representation f d. 
As far as other problems are concerned, RPI still 
problematic. In particular, because of problem 3, 
P(cld) would become an illegitimate value. In our 
experiments, as well as in Lewis' experiments (1992), 
P(cld ) ranges from 0 to more than 101°. 
3 A P robab i l i s t i c  Mode l  Based  on  a 
S ing le  Random Var iab le  w i th  
Mu l t ip le  Va lues  (SVMV)  
In this section, we propose a new probabilistic model 
for text categorization, and compare it to the previous 
three models from several viewpoints. Our model is 
very simple, but yet solves problems 1, 2, and 3 in 
PRW. 
Document representation of our model is basically 
the same as CT, that is a document is a set of its 
constituting terms. The major difference between our 
model and others is the way of document characteriza- 
tion through probabilities. While almost all previous 
models assume that an event space for a document is 
whether the document is indexed or not by a term 2, 
our model characterizes a document as random sam- 
pling of a term from the term set that represents the 
document. For example, an event "T = ti" means that 
a randomly selected term from a document is ti. If we 
want to emphasis indexing process like other models, it 
is possible to interpret "T = ti" as a randomly selected 
element from a document being indexed by the term 
ti. 
Formally, our model can be seen as modifying Fuhr's 
derivation of P(cld ) by replacing an index vector with 
a single random variable whose value is one of possi- 
ble terms. Conditioning P(cld ) for each possible event 
gives 
P(cld) = ~_~ P(c\]d, T = t i ) f (T  = tild). (11) 
ti 
If we assume conditional independence between c and 
d, given T = ti, that is P(cid, T = ti) = P(c\]T = tl), 
we obtain 
P(cld) = Z P(cIT = t i )P (T  = tild). (12) 
ti 
Using Bayes' theorem, this becomes 
Z P(T  = t i lc)P(T = ti Id) P(cld) P(c) t, P (T  = ti) (13) 
All the probabilities in Eq. (13) can be estimated from 
given training data based on the following definitions. 
 P (T  =t i l c )  is the probability that a randomly 
selected term in a document is ti, given that the 
document is assigned to c. We used ~c  as the 
estimator. NCi is the frequency of the term ti in 
the category c, and NC is the total frequency of 
terms in c. 
2In section 2 explaining previous models, we simplified 
"a document is indexed by a term" as "a document contains 
a term" for ease of explanation. 
164 
,, P (T  = tild) is the probability that a randomly 
selected term in a target document d is ti. We 
used ~D as the estimator. NDi  is the frequency 
of the term ti in the document d, and ND is the 
total frequency of terms in d. 
* P (T  = ti) is the prior probability that a randomly 
selected term in a randomly selected ocument is 
ti. We used ~t as the estimator. Ni is the fre- 
quency of the term ti in the given training doc- 
uments, and N is the total frequency of terms in 
the training documents. 
 P(c) is the prior probability that a randomly se- 
lected document is categorized into c. We used 
D_~ as the estimator. Dc is the frequency of docu- D 
meats that is categorized to c in the given training 
documents, and D is the frequency of documents 
in the training documents. 
Here, let us recall the three problems of PRW. Since 
SVMV's primitive probabilities are based on within- 
document term frequencies, SVMV does not have prob- 
lem 1. Furthermore, SVMV does not have problem 2 
either because Eq. (13) includes a factor P(T  = tld), 
which accomplishes term weighting for a target docu- 
ment d. 
For problem 3, let us reconsider the previous exam- 
ple; R documents in the training data are categorized 
into a category c, none of the R documents has term 
ti, but a target document d does. If the straightfor- 
ward estimate of P (T /= llc ) = 0 or P(T  = tilc) = 0 is 
adopted, the document d would never be categorized 
into c in the previous models (PRW, CT, and RPI). 
In SVMV, the probability P(c\[d) is much less affected 
by such estimates. This is because P(cld ) in Eq. (13) 
takes the sum of each term's weight. In this example, 
the weight for ti is estimated to be 0 as in the other 
models, but this little affect the total value of P(c\[d). 
A similar argument applies to all other problems in 
(Robertson and Sparck Jones, 1976) that are caused 
by having insufficient training cases. SVMV is formally 
proven not to suffer from the serious effects (like never 
being assigned to a category or always being assigned 
to a category) by having insufficient training cases. In 
other words, SVMV can directly use the straightfor- 
ward estimates. In addition, we experimentally verified 
that the value of P(dlc ) in SVMV is always a legitimate 
value (i.e., 0 to 1) unlike in RPI. 
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the four 
probabilistic models.

PRW CT RPI SVMV 
Problem 1 considered no yes no yes 
Problem 2 considered no yes (yes) yes 
Problem 3 considered no no no yes 
PRP satisfied yes no ye s yes 
As illustrated in the table, SVMV has better character- 
istics for text categorization compared to the previous 
models. In the next section, we will experimentally 
verify SVMV's superiority. 
4 Exper iments  
This section describes experiments conducted to eval- 
uate the performance of our model (SVMV) compared 
to the other three (PRW, CT, and RPI). 
4.1 Data and Preprocess ing  
A collection of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) full-text 
news stories (Liberman, 1991) 3 was used in the experi- 
ments. We extracted all 12,380 articles from 1989/7/25 
to 1989/11/2. 
The WSJ articles from 1989 are indexed with 78 
categories (topics). Articles having no category were 
excluded. 8,907 articles remained; each having 1.94 
categories on the average. The largest category is 
"TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)" 
which encompassed 2,475 articles; the smallest one is 
"RUBBER (RUB)", assigned to only 2 articles. On the 
average, one category is assigned to 443 articles. 
All 8,907 articles were tagged by the Xerox Part-of- 
Speech Tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) 4. From the tagged 
articles, we extracted the root words of nouns using 
the "ispell" program 5. As a result, each article has a 
set of root words representing it, and each element in 
the set (i.e. root word of a noun) corresponds to a 
term. We did not reduce the number of terms by using 
stop words list or feature selection method, etc. The 
number of terms amounts to 32,975. 
Before the experiments, we divided 8,907 articles 
into two sets; one for training (i.e., for probability 
estimation), and the other for testing. The division 
was made according to chronology. All articles that 
appeared from 1989/7/25 to 1989/9/29 went into a 
training set of 5,820 documents, and all articles from 
1989/10/2 to 1989/11/2 went into a test set of 3,087 
documents. 
4.2 Category  Ass ignment  Strategies 
In the experiments, the probabilities, P(c), P(Ti = 
llc), P(T  =ti lc) ,  and so forth, were estimated from 
the 5,820 training documents, as described in the pre- 
vious sections. Using these estimates, we calculated the 
posterior probability (P(cld)) for each document (d) of 
the 3,087 test documents and each of the 78 categories 
3We used "ACL/DCI (September 1991)" CD-ROM 
which is distributed from the Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC). For more details, please contact Mark Liberman 
(myl@lmagi. cis. upena, edu).

via anonymous FTP from the host parc~tp.xerox.cora in 
the directory pub/tagger.

used the "ispell version 3.0" which is available via anony- 
mous FTP from the host f tp .  as  .ucla. edu in the directory 
pub/ispell.

(c). The four probabilistic models are compared in this 
calculation. 
There are several strategies for assigning categories 
to a document based on the probability P(cld ). The 
simplest one is the k-per-doc strategy (Field, 1975) that 
assigns the top k categories to each document. A more 
sophisticated one is the probability threshold strategy, 
in which all the categories above a user-defined thresh- 
old are assigned to a document. 
Lewis proposed the proportional assignment strat- 
egy based on the probabilistic ranking principle (Lewis, 
1992). Each category is assigned to its top scoring doc- 
uments in proportion to the number of times the cat- 
egory was assigned in the training data. For example, 
a category assigned to 2% of the training documents 
would be assigned to the top scoring 0.2% of the test 
documents if the proportionality constant was 0.1, or 
to 10% of the test documents if the proportionality 
constant was 5.0. 
4.3 Results and Discussions 
By using a category assignment s rategy, several cat- 
egories are assigned to each test document. The 
best known measures for evaluating text categoriza- 
tion models are recall and precision, calculated by the 
following equations (Lewis, 1992): 
the number of categories that are 
Recall : correctly assigned to documents 
the number of categories that should be' 
assigned to documents 
the number of categories that are 
Precision = correctly assigned to documents 
the number of categories that are" 
assigned to documents 
Note that recall and precision have somewhat mutually 
exclusive characteristics. To raise the recall value, one 
can simply assign many categories to each document. 
However, this leads to a degradation i precision; i.e., 
almost all the assigned categories are false. A breakeven 
point might be used to summarize the balance between 
recall and precision, the point at which they are equal. 
For each strategy, we calculated breakeven points by 
using the four probabilistic models. Table 2 shows the 
best breakeven points identified for the three strategies 
along with the used models.

Prop. assignment 0.63 (by SVMV) 
Prob. thresholding 0.47 (by SVMV) 
k-per-doe 0.43 (by SVMV) 
From Table 2, we find that SVMV with proportional 
assignment gives the best result (0.63). The superior- 
ity of proportional ssignment over the other strategies 
has already been reported by Lewis (1992). Our ex- 
periment verified Lewis' assumption. In addition, for 
any of the three strategies, SVMV gives the highest 
breakeven point among the four probabilistic models. 
Figure 1 shows the recall/precision trade off for 
the four probabilistic models with proportional ssign- 
ment strategy. As a reference, the recall/precision 
curve of a well-known vector model (Salton and Yang, 
1973) ("TF.IDF")6 is also presented. Table 3 lists the 
breakeven point for each model. All the breakeven 
points were obtained when proportionality constant 
was about 1.0.

From Figure 1 and Table 3, we can see that: 
 as far as this dataset is concerned, SVMV with 
proportional ssignment s rategy gives the best re- 
sult among the four probabilistic models, 
 the models that consider within-document term 
frequencies (SVMV, CT) are better than those 
that do not (PRW, RPI), 
Sin the model we used, each element of document vector 
is the "term frequency" multiplied by the "inverted ocu- 
ment frequency." Similarity between every pair of vectors 
is measured by cosine. Note that this is the simplest version 
of TF.IDF model, and there has been many improvements 
which we did not consider in the experiments. 
166 
 the models that consider term weighting for tar- 
get documents (SVMV, CT) are better than those 
that do not (PRW, (RPI)), and 
 the models that are less affected by having insuffi- 
cient training cases (SVMV) are better than those 
that are (CT, RPI, PRW). 
5 Conclusion 
We have proposed a new probabilistic model for text 
categorization. Compared to previous models, our 
model has the following advantages; 1) it considers 
within document term frequencies, 2) considers term 
weighting for target documents, and 3) is less affected 
by having insufficient training cases. We have also pro- 
vided empirical results verifying our model's uperior- 
ity over the others in the task of categorizing news 
articles from the "Wall Street Journal." 
There are several directions along which this work 
could be extended. 
 We have to compare our probabilistic model 
to other non probabilistic models like decision 
tree/rule based models, one of which has recently 
been reported to be promising (Apt4 et al., 1994). 
 While we used simple document representation in 
which a document is defined as a set of nouns, 
there could be considered several improvements, 
such as using phrasal information (Lewis, 1992), 
clustering terms (Sparck Jones, 1973), reducing 
the number of features by using local dictio- 
nary (Apt4 et al., 1994), etc. 
 We are incorporating our probabilistic model into 
cluster-based text categorization that offers an ef- 
ficient and effective search strategy.
