Linguistics and Phi/osophyfocuses onissues related to structure and meaning 
in natural language, as addressed in the philosophy of language, linguistic 
semantics, syntax and related disciplines, in particular the following areas: 
- philosophical theories of meaning and truth, reference, description, 
entailment, presupposition, implicatures, context-dependence, and 
speech acts; 
- linguistic theories of semantic interpretation i  relation to syntactic 
structure and prosody, of discourse structure, lexcial semantics and 
semantic change; 
- psycholinguistic theories of semantic interpretation and issues of the 
processing and acquisition of natural anguage, and the relation of 
semantic interpretation to other cognitive faculties; 
- mathematical and logical properties of natural anguage and general 
aspects of computational linguistics; 
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science: linguistics 
methodology, properties of linguistic theories and frameworks, and the 
relation of linguistics to other fields of inquiry.

BENEFITS, PAYMENT AND ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS 
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of  when dues are paid. 
Membership includes a full year of  the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored 
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, fund donations, back issues, and 
proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. IMPORTANT NOTE: Renewals must be received no later than 1 April 
2000 to avoid late payment fee assessment. Membership categories include Regular Members and the following: Couples 
with the same mailing address may be Joint Members; they will receive only one set of  publications, but each will be eligible 
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may become 
Student Members WITH COPY OF CURRENT STUDENT ID. Students who are not Student Members because of  their 
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed 
memberships. We now offer MULTI -YEAR MEMBERSHIPS to Regular and Joint members. If no indication is provided 
of  multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does

Guidelines for Submissions 
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted On letter-size paper (8.5 by 
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and,refer- 
ences. The paper should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. 
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact he editor egarding the possibility of electronic 
submission. 
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: 
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com- 
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The 
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to 
forty double-spaced pages.- That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully 
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni- 
cally; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the I~TEX 
style files. The submissior~ of an article to CL for refereeing means that the author certifies 
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to 
another efereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non- 
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at 
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must 
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the 
case of a "work for hire," by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 
U.S. Copyright law. 
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant o the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con- 
tributions for inclusion. 
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters hould be' sent to:

(+1 973) 360-8330; acl@research.att.com 
Squibs and Discussions: This category includes hort articles reporting technical results, dis- 
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest o the 
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should 
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (I~TEX source, postscript or plain 
text) are welcome and should be submitted to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and 
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was 
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing 
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring 
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural 
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics 
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language 
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; 
others are likely to be added.
