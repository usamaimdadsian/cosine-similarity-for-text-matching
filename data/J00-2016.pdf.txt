This volume is a collection of important pa- 
pers selected from the proceedings of the 
first three Workshops on Very Large Corpora 
(Columbus, 1993; Kyoto, 1994; Cambridge, 
MA, 1995) and the 1995 workshop entitled 
From Text to Tags (Dublin). The editors write 
in their introduction: "The success of these 
workshops was in some measure a reflection 
of the growing popularity of corpus-based 
methods in the NLP community. But first and 
foremost, itwas due to the fact that the work- 
shops attracted so many high-quality papers. 
The importance of this material for the field 
is such that it deserves to be made more read- 
ily available than harder-to-find or out-of- 
print workshop proceedings." The contents

"This book is the development of a series of 
lectures to undergraduate and post-graduate 
students at Macquarie University on basic 
principles in acoustic phonetics and speech 
signal processing. The first part of the book is 
intended to provide students with the ability 
to interpret acoustic records of speech sig- 
nals in their various forms. These chapters 
include a review of elementary wave mo- 
tion and frequency analysis as applied to 
speech, a summary of the relationship be- 
tween speech production and its acoustic 
consequences, and a review of the principal 
cues to speech sounds and prosodic units.

Briefly Noted 
The material from these first four chapters 
(and the related exercises on the accompa- 
nying CD-ROM) has formed the basis of a 
one-semester undergraduate course in acous- 
tic phonetics to students primarily of linguis- 
tics, but also of other disciplines including 
computer science and psychology. 
"The second part of the book provides 
an introduction to speech signal processing, 
which is intended for similar groups of stu- 
dents. It is therefore different from more de- 
tailed introductory texts in this area, which 
assume both a background in engineering / 
signal processing and a more sophisticated 
mathematical knowledge. Part of the moti- 
vation for writing this section of the book is 
to make many of the techniques and algo- 
rithms that are discussed in the engineering 
literature on speech analysis more accessible 
to both students and researchers ofphonetics 
and speech science whose training is not usu- 
ally in a scientific discipline. We have there- 
fore tried to keep equations to a minimum 
and to assume, as far as possible, no more 
than a very basic understanding of algebra 
and trigonometry. In this part of the book we 
cover fundamental aspects of time and fre- 
quency domain processing of speech signals, 
digital techniques for combining (in digital 
formant synthesis) and separating (in linear 
predictive coding) the contributions of the 
source and filter to the acoustic speech sig- 
nal, and techniques for the probabilistic las- 
sification of acoustic speech data that form 
the basis of more advanced work in auto- 
matic speech recognition."--From the preface

"Syntactic Theory: A Formal Introduction ... 
marks a return to 'generative grammar' in 
its original sense. This book focuses on the 
development of precisely formulated gram- 
mars whose empirical predictions can be di- 
rectly tested. There is considerable emphasis 
on prediction and evaluation of grammatical 
hypotheses, as well as on integrating syntac- 
tic hypotheses with matters of semantic anal- 
ysis. Problem solving is also emphasized; the 
extensive problem sets draw from a variety 
of languages other than English. Special at- 
tention is paid to the nature of lexical en- 
tries and the organization of the lexicon in 
terms of type hierarchies and constraint in- 
heritance. The theoretical perspective of the 
book is presented in the context of current 
models of language processing, which pro- 
vide motivation for a constraint-based, lexi- 
calist grammatical rchitecture, whose value 
has already been demonstrated in computer 
language processing applications.'--From the

"In this book, I propose, in outline, a new 
theory of grammar, which I call Word-Order 
Based Grammar. 
"In my theory, word order is the primary 
grammatical principle. It is accompanied by 
the principle of lexical valency, and the prin- 
ciple of the recursive expansion of the sen- 
tence. 
"I offer alternative accounts of the ma- 
jor problems of linguistic theory in terms 
of word-order: for the scoping properties of 
the operators of natural language ... ; for 
anaphoric reference ... ; for wh-extraction, 
movement and parasitic gaps ... ; and for 
word-order in general ... 
"I propose that there are five basic types of 
word-order: fixed deep word-order, free deep 
word-order, fixed surface word-order, free 
surface word-order corresponding to deep 
word-order, and free surface word-order not 
corresponding to deep word-order.'--From
