This paper presents an algorithm for identifying noun phrase antecedents ofthird person personal 
pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns, and omitted pronouns (zero pronouns) 
in unrestricted Spanish texts. We define a list of constraints and preferences for different ypes 
of pronominal expressions, and we document in detail the importance of each kind of knowledge 
(lexical, morphological, syntactic, and statistical) in anaphora resolution for Spanish. The paper 
also provides a definition for syntactic onditions on Spanish NP-pronoun oncoreference using 
partial parsing. The algorithm has been evaluated on a corpus of 1,677 pronouns and achieved 
a success rate of 76.8%. We have also implemented four competitive algorithms and tested their 
performance in a blind evaluation on the same test corpus. This new approach could easily be 
extended to other languages uch as English, Portuguese, Italian, or Japanese. 
1. Introduction 
We present an algorithm for identifying noun phrase antecedents of personal pro- 
nouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns, and omitted pronouns (zero pro- 
nouns) in Spanish. The algorithm identifies both intrasentential and intersentential 
antecedents and is applied to the syntactic analysis generated by the slot unifica- 
t ion parser (SUP) (Ferr~ndez, Palomar, and Moreno 1998b). It also combines different 
forms of knowledge by distinguishing between constraints and preferences. Whereas 
constraints are used as combinations of several kinds of knowledge (lexical, mor- 
phological, and syntactic), preferences are defined as a combination of heuristic rules 
extracted from a study of different corpora. 
We present he following main contributions in this paper: 
• an algorithm for anaphora resolution in Spanish texts that uses different 
kinds of knowledge

of anaphora that we would be resolving. In Section 3, we present he algorithm and 
discuss its main properties. In Section 4, we evaluate the algorithm. In Section 5, we 
compare our algorithm with several other approaches to anaphora resolution. Finally, 
we present our conclusions. 
2. Our Classification Scheme for Pronominal Expressions in Spanish 
In this section, we present our classification scheme for identifying the different ypes 
of anaphora that we will be resolving. Personal pronouns (PPR), demonstrative pro- 
nouns (DPR), reflexive pronouns (RPR), and omitted pronouns (OPa) are some of the 
most frequent ypes of anaphoric expressions found in Spanish and are the main 
subject of this study. Personal and demonstrative pronouns are further classified ac- 
cording to whether they appear within a prepositional phrase (PP) or whether they 
are complement personal pronouns (clitic pronouns1). We present examples for each 
of the four types of common anaphora. Each example is presented in three forms: as a 
Spanish sentence, as a word-to-word translation into English, and correctly translated 
into English. 2
2.1 Clitic Personal Pronouns (CPPR) 
In the case of clitic personal pronouns, I0, la, le 'him, her, it' and los, las, les 'them', we 
consider that the third person personal pronoun plays the role of the complement. 
(1) Ana abre \[la verja\]i y lai cierra tras de si. 
Ana opens \[the gate\]/ and it/ closes after herself 
'Ana opens the gate and closes it after herself.' 
2.2 Personal Pronouns Not Included in a PP (PPanotPP) 
We include in this class the personal pronouns ~l, ella, ello 'he, she, it' and ellas, ellos 
'they'. 
(2) Andr6si es mi vecino, t~li vive en el segundo piso. 
Andr6si is my neighbor Hei lives on the second floor 
'Andr6s is my neighbor. He lives on the second floor.' 
1 According to Mathews (1997), aclitic pronoun is a pronoun that is treated as an independent word in 
syntax but that forms a phonological unit with the verb that precedes or follows it. 
2 Coindexing indicates coreference b tween anaphor and antecedent.

Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
2.3 Personal Pronouns Included in a PP (PPRinPP) 
We include in this class the personal pronouns dl, ella, ello 'him, her, it' and ellas, ellos 
'them'. 
(3) Juan/ debe asistir pero Pedro lo har~i por 61i. 
Juani must attend but Pedro it will do for himi 
'Juan must attend but Pedro will do it for him.' 
2.4 Demonstrative Pronouns Not Included in a PP (DPRnotPP) 
We include in this class the demonstrative pronouns ~ste, dsta, esto 'this'; ~stos, ~stas 
'these'; dse, ~sa, aqu~l, aqu~lla 'that'; and dsos, dsas, aqu~llos, aqudllas 'those'. 
(4) E1 Ferrarii gan6 al Ford. t~stei es el mejor. 
the Ferrarii beat the Ford This/ is the best 
'The Ferrari beat the Ford. This is the best.' 
2.5 Demonstrative Pronouns Included in a PP (DPRinPP) 
We include in this class the demonstrative pronouns ~ste, ~sta, esto 'this'; ~stos, ~stas 
'these'; dse, ~sa, aqudl, aqudlla 'that'; and dsos, ~sas, aqu~llos, aqudllas 'those'. 
(5) Ana vive con Pacoi y cocina para 6stei diariamente. 
Ana lives with Pacoi and cooks for this/ every day 
'Ana lives with Paco and cooks for him every day.' 
2.6 Reflexive Pronouns (RPR) 
We include in this class the reflexive pronouns e, sL si mismo 'himself, herself, itself' 
and consigo, consigo mismo 'themselves'. 
(6) Anai abre la verja y la cierra tras de sfi. 
Anai opens the gate and it closes after herself/ 
'Ana opens the gate and closes it after herself.' 
2.7 Omitted Pronouns (Zero Pronouns OPa) 
The omitted pronoun is the most frequent ype of anaphoric expression in Spanish, as 
we will show in Section 4.2. Omitted pronouns occur when the pronominal subject is 
omitted. This kind of pronoun also occurs in other languages, such as Portuguese or 
Japanese; in these languages, it can also appear in object position, whereas in Spanish 
or Italian, it can appear only in subject position. In the following example, the omission 
is represented by the symbol 13 (the symbol does not appear in the correct ranslation 
into English). 
(7) Anai abre la verja y (~i la cierra tras de sf. 
Anai opens the gate and Oi it closes after herself 
'Ana opens the gate and she closes it after herself.' 
3. Anaphora Resolution Algorithm 
In the algorithm, all the types of anaphora are identified from left to right as they 
appear in the sentence. The most important proposals for anaphora resolution--such 
as those of Baldwin (1997), Lappin and Leass (1994), Hobbs (1978), or Kennedy and 
Boguraev (1996)--are based on a separation between constraints and preferences. 
547 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
Constraints discard some of the candidates, whereas preferences simply sort the re- 
maining candidates. A constraint defines a property that must be satisfied in order 
for any candidate to be considered as a possible solution of the anaphor. For example, 
pronominal anaphors and antecedents must agree in person, gender, and number. 3 
Otherwise, the candidate is discarded as a possible solution. A preference is a charac- 
teristic that is not always satisfied by the solution of an anaphor. The application of 
preferences usually involves the use of heuristic rules in order to obtain a ranked list 
of candidates. 
Each type of anaphora has its own set of constraints and preferences, although 
they all follow the same general algorithm: constraints are applied first, followed by 
preferences. 
Based on the preceding description, our algorithm contains the following main 
components: 
• identification of the type of pronoun 
• constraints 
- -  morphological greement (person, gender, and number) 
- -  syntactic onditions on NP-pronoun oncoreference 
• preferences 
In order to apply this algorithm to unrestricted texts, it has been necessary to use 
partial parsing. In our partial-parsing scheme, as presented in Ferr~ndez, Palomar, and 
Moreno (1999), we only parse coordinated NPs and PPs, verbal chunks, pronouns, and 
what we have called free conjunctions (i.e., conjunctions that do not join coordinated 
NPs or PPs). Words that do not appear within these constituents are simply ignored. 
The NP constituents include coordinated adjectives, relative clauses, coordinated PPs, 
and appositives as modifiers. 
With this partial-parsing scheme, we divide a sentence into clauses by parsing first 
the free conjunction and then the verbs, as in the following example: 
(8) Pedro compr6 un regalo y se lo dio a Ana. 
Pedro bought a gift and her it gave to Ana 
'Pedro bought a gift and gave it to Ana.' 
In this example, we have parsed the following constituents: np(Pedro), v(comprO), np(un 
regalo),freeconj(y), pron(se), pron(lo), v(dio), pp(a Ana). We are able to divide this sentence 
into two clauses because it contains the free conjunction y 'and' and the two verbs 
compr6 'bought' and clio 'gave'. 
3.1 Identification of the Kind of Pronoun 
The algorithm uses partial-parse trees to automatically identify omitted pronouns by 
employing the following steps: 
• The sentence is divided into clauses (by parsing the free conjunction 
followed by the verbs). 
3 In our implementation, thismorphological information is extracted from the part-of-speech tagger. 
548 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
An NP or pronoun is sought for each clause by analyzing the clause 
constituents on the left-hand side of the verb, unless the verb is 
imperative or impersonal. The chosen NP or pronoun must agree in 
person and number with the clausal verb. (In evaluating this algorithm, 
Ferr~ndez and Peral \[2000\] achieved a success rate of 88% for detecting 
omitted pronouns.) 
The remaining pronouns are identified based on part-of-speech (POS) tagger out- 
puts. 
3.2 Morphological Agreement 
Person, gender, and number agreement are checked in order to discard potential an- 
tecedents. For example, in the sentence 
(9) Juanj vio a Rosa/. Ella/ estaba muy feliz. 
Juanj saw to Rosa/ Shei was very happy 
'Juan saw Rosa. She was very happy.' 
there are two possible antecedents for ella 'she', whose slot structures 4 are 
np (conc (sing, masc), X, Juan) 
np (conc (sing, fem), Y, Rosa) 
whereas the slot structure of the pronoun is 
pron (conc (sing, fem), Z, ella). 
In order to decide between the two antecedents, he unification of both slot struc- 
tures (pronoun and candidate) is carried out by the slot unification parser (Ferr~ndez, 
Palomar, and Moreno 1999). In this example, the candidate Juan is rejected by this 
morphological greement constraint. 
3.3 Syntactic Conditions on NP-Pronoun Noncoreference 
These conditions are based on c-command and minimal-governing-category constraints 
as formulated by Reinhart (1983) and on the noncoreference conditions of Lappin and 
Leass (1994). They are of great importance in any anaphora resolution system that 
does not use semantic information, as is the case with our proposal. In such systems, 
recency is important in selecting the antecedent of an anaphor. That is to say, the 
closest NP to the anaphor has a better chance of being selected as the solution. One 
problem, however, is that such constraints are formulated using full parsing, whereas 
if we want to work with unrestricted texts we should be using partial parsing, as 
previously defined. 
We have therefore proposed a set of noncoreference onditions for Spanish, using 
partial parsing, although they could easily be extended to other languages such as En- 
glish. In our system, the following types of pronouns are noncoreferential with a noun 
phrase (NP) under the conditions noted (noncoindexing indicates that a candidate is
rejected by these conditions). 
4 The term slot structure is defined in Ferr~ndez, Palomar, and Moreno (1998b). The slot structure stores 
morphological and syntactic information related to the different constituents of a sentence. 
549

. 
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
. 
(a) 
Reflexive pronouns are noncoreferential when: 
(b) 
(10) 
the NP is included in another constituent (e.g., the NP is 
included in a PP) 
Ante Luisj sei frot6 con la toalla. 
in front of Luisj himself/ rubbed with the towel 
'He rubbed himself with the towel in front of Luis.' 
In this sentence, we would have obtained the following sequence 
of constituents after our partial-parsing scheme: pp(prep(ante), 
np(Luis )) , pron(se) , v(frot6 ) , pp(prep( con) , np(la toalla) . Following 
the above-stated condition, the NP Luis cannot corefer with the 
reflexive pronoun se since Luis is included in a PP (ante Luis). 
the NP is in a different clause or sentence 
(11) Anaj trajo un cuchillo y Eva/ sei cort6. 
Anaj brought a knife and Eva/ herself/ cut 
'Ana brought a knife and Eva cut herself.' 
the NP appears after the verb and there is another NP in the 
same clause before the verb 
(12) 
(13) 
Juan/ sei cort6 con el cuchilloj. 
Juan/ himself/ cut with the knifej 
'Juan cut himself with the knife.' 
Under these conditions, coreference is allowed between the NP 
and the reflexive pronoun, since both are in the same clause. For 
example: 
Juan/ queria verlo por s~ mismoi. 
Juan/ wanted see it for himself/ 
'Juan wanted to see it for himself.' 
In this example, Juan and the reflexive pronoun si mismo 
'himself' corefer since Juan is in the same clause as the anaphor, 
it is not included in another constituent, and it appears before 
the verb. 
Clitic pronouns are noncoreferential when: 
the NP is included in a PP (except hose headed by the 
preposition a 'to') 
(14) Con Juan/ loj compr6. 
with Juan/ itj bought 
'I bought it with Juan.' 
the NP is located more than three constituents before the clitic 
pronoun in the same clause 
(15) En casai \[el martillo\]j no se loj di. 
at home/ \[the hammer\]j not him itj gave 
'I didn't give him the hammer at home.' 
550 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
. 
(a) 
(17) 
(b) 
In this example, the direct object el martillo 'the hammer '  has 
been moved from its common position after the verb, and it is 
necessary to fill the resulting gap with the pronoun lo 'it' even 
though it does not appear in the English translation. This 
phenomenon 5 can be considered an exception to the c-command 
constraints as formulated by Reinhart when applied to Spanish 
clitic pronouns. 
Moreover, if the last two conditions are not fulfilled by the NP and the 
verb is in the first or second person, then this NP will necessarily be the 
solution of the pronoun: 
(16) \[El boligrafo\]i 1Oi comprar~s en esa tienda. 
\[The pen\]/ iti will buy in that shop 
'You will buy the pen in that shop.' 
Personal and demonstrative (nonclitic) pronouns are noncoreferential 
when the NP is in the same clause as the anaphor, and: 
the pronoun comes before the verb (in full parsing, this would 
mean that it is the subject of its clause) 
Ante Luisi 61j salud6 a Pedrok. 
in front of Luisi hey greeted to Pedrok 
'He greeted Pedro in front of Luis.' 
the pronoun comes after the verb (in full parsing, this would 
mean that it is the object of the verb) and the NP is not included 
in another NP 
(18) \[El padre de Juanj\]i le venci6 a 41j. 
\[Juanj's father\]/ him beat to himj 
'Juan's father beat him.' 
In this example, the pronoun ~I 'him' cannot corefer with the NP 
el padre de Juan 'Juan's father', but it can corefer with Juan since it 
is a modifier of the NP el padre de Juan. 
It should be mentioned that the clitic pronoun le is another 
form of the pronoun dl 'him'. This is a typical phenomenon i
Spanish, where clitic pronouns occupy the object position. 
Sometimes both the clitic pronoun and the object appear in the 
same clause, as occurs in the previous example and in the 
following one: 
(19) A Pedro/ yo lei vi ayer. 
to Pedroj I himi saw yesterday 
'I saw Pedro yesterday.' 
This example also illustrates the previously mentioned exception 
of c-command constraints for Spanish clitic pronouns. In this 
case, the direct object a Pedro 'to Pedro' has been moved before 
the verb, and the clitic pronoun le 'him' has been added. It 
should also be remarked that, as noted earlier, the clitic pronoun 
does not appear in the English translation. 
5 Mathews (1997) calls this phenomenon "clitic doubling" and defines it as the use of a clitic pronoun 
with the same referent and in the same syntactic function as another element in the same clause. 
551 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
(c) the pronoun is included in a PP that is not included in another 
constituent and the NP is not included in another constituent 
(NP or PP) 
(20) \[El padre de Luisj\]i juega con 61j. 
\[Luisj's father\]/ plays with himj 
'Luis's father plays with him.' 
In this example, the pronoun ~I 'him' is included in a PP (which 
is not included in another constituent) and the NP el padre de 
Luis is not included in another NP or PP. Therefore, the NP 
cannot corefer with the pronoun. However, the NP Luis can 
corefer because it is included in the NP el padre de Luis. 
(d) the pronoun is included in an NP, so that the NP in which the 
pronoun is included cannot corefer with the pronoun 
(21) Pedro/ vio \[al hermano de ~li\] j. 
Pedro/ saw \[the brother of himi\]j 
'Pedro saw his brother.' 
(e) the pronoun is coordinated with other NPs, so that the other 
coordinated NPs cannot corefer with the pronoun 
(22) Juan/, \[el tio de Ana\]j, y 61k fueron de pesca. 
Juan/, \[Ana's uncle\]j, and hek went fishing 
'He, Juan, and Ana's uncle went fishing.' 
(f) the pronoun is included in a relative clause, and the following 
condition is met: 
. 
(24) 
i. the NP in which the relative clause is included does not 
corefer with the pronoun 
(23) Pedroj vio a \[un amigo que juega con 41j\]i. 
Pedroj saw to \[a friend that plays with himj\]i 
'Pedro saw a friend that he plays with.' 
ii. the NPs that are included in the relative clause follow 
the previous conditions 
iii. the remaining NPs outside the relative clause could 
corefer with the pronoun 
Personal and demonstrative (nonclitic) pronouns are noncoreferential 
when the NP is not in the same clause as the pronoun. (In this case, the 
NP can corefer with the pronoun, except when this NP also appears in 
the same sentence and clause as the pronoun, in which case it will have 
been discarded by the previous noncoreference onditions.) 
Anaj y Evai son amigas. Evai lej ayuda mucho. 
Anay and Evai are friends Evai herj helps a lot 
'Ana and Eva are friends. Eva helps her a lot.' 
It is important o note that the above-mentioned conditions refer to those coor- 
dinated NPs and PPs that have been partially parsed. Moreover, as previously men- 
tioned, NPs can include relative clauses, appositives, coordinated PPs, and adjectives. 
552 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
We should also remark that we consider aconstituent A to be included in a constituent 
B if A modifies the head of B. Let us consider the following NP: 
(25) \[el hombre que ama a \[una mujer que lei ama\]j\]i 
\[the man who loves to \[a woman who him/ loveslj\]i 
'the man who loves a woman who loves him.' 
We consider that the pronoun le 'him' is included in the relative clause that mod- 
ifies the NP una mujer que le ama 'a woman who loves him', which then cannot corefer 
with it due to noncoreference ondition 3(f)i. Under condition 3(f)iii, however, the 
pronoun le 'him' could corefer with the entire NP el hombre que area a una mujer que le 
area 'the man who loves a woman who loves him'. 
Another example might be the following: 
(26) Eva/ tiene \[un tio que lei toma el pelo\]j. 
Evai has \[an uncle that heri teases\]j 
'Eva has an uncle who teases her.' 
In this example, the pronoun is included within the relative clause that modifies un 
tio 'an uncle', and therefore cannot corefer with it. But, following condition 3(f)iii, it 
can corefer with Eva. 
3.4 Preferences 
To obtain the different sets of preferences, we utilized the training corpus to identify 
the importance of each kind of knowledge that is used by humans when tracking 
down the NP antecedent of a pronoun. Our results are shown in Table 1. For our 
analysis, the antecedents for each pronoun in the text were identified, along with their 
configurational characteristics with reference to the pronoun. Thus, the table shows 
how often each configurational characteristic is valid for the solution of a particular 
pronoun. For example, the solution of a reflexive pronoun is a proper noun 53% of the 
time. The total number of pronoun occurrences in the study was 575. Thus, we were 
able to define the different patterns of Spanish pronoun resolution and apply them in 
order to obtain the evaluation results that are presented in this paper. The order of 
importance was determined by first sorting the preferences according to the percentage 
of each configurational characteristic; that is, preferences with higher percentages were 
applied before those with lower percentages. After several experiments on the training 
corpus, an optimal order--the one that produced the best performance--was obtained. 
Since in this evaluation phase we processed texts from different genres and by different 
authors, we can state that the final set of preferences obtained and their order of 
application can be used with confidence on any Spanish text. 
Based on the results presented in Table 1, we have extracted a set of preferences for 
each type of anaphora (listed below). We have distinguished between those pronouns 
that are included within PPs and those that are not. That is because when a pronoun 
is included in a PP, the preposition of this PP sets a preference. 
Preferences of omitted pronouns (OPR): 
1. NPs that are not of time, direction, quantity, or abstract type; that is to 
say, inanimate candidates are rejected (e.g., hal~past en, Market Street, 
three pounds, or a thing) 
2. NPs in the same sentence as the omitted pronotm

3.5 Resolution Procedure 
The resolution procedure consists of the following steps: 
1. Identify the type of anaphora: pronominal  (PPRinPP or PPRnotPP), 
demonstrat ive (DPRinPP or DPRnotPP), reflexive (RPR), or omitted 
(oPR). 
555 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
2. Identify the NP candidate antecedents of a pronoun in order to create a 
list L. The list created will depend on the type of anaphor and the 
anaphoric accessibility space (empirically obtained from a deep study 
of the training corpus) and will be developed according to the 
following criteria: 
• For pronominal anaphora, demonstrative anaphora, and 
omitted pronouns, NP candidates will appear in the same 
sentence as the anaphor and in the four previous sentences. 
• For reflexive anaphora, NP candidates will appear in the same 
sentence as the anaphor. 
3. Apply constraints to L to obtain LI: 
(a) morphological agreement 
(b) syntactic onditions on NP-pronoun noncoreference 
4. If the number of elements of L1 - 1, then the solution is that element. 
5. If the number of elements of L1 = 0, then the solution is an exophor. 
6. If the number of elements of L1 > 1, then apply preferences to L1 to 
obtain L2. Depending on the type of anaphora, a different set and order 
of preferences will be applied (see Section 3.4). 
7. If the number of elements of L2 = 1, then the solution is that element. 
8. If the number of elements of L2 > 1, then apply the following three 
basic preferences in the order shown until only one candidate remains 
(these three preferences are common to all the pronouns): 
• NPs most repeated in the text 
• NPs that have appeared most with the verb of the anaphor 
• the first candidate of the remaining list (the closest one to the 
anaphor) 
After applying these basic preferences, the antecedent is obtained. 
4. Empirical Evaluation 
4.1 Description of Corpora 
We have tested the algorithm on both technical manuals and literary texts. In the first 
instance, we used a portion of the Spanish edition of the Blue Book corpus. 6 This 
corpus contains the handbook of the International Telecommunications Union CCITT, 
published in English, French, and Spanish; it is one of the most important collections of 
telecommunications texts available and contains 5,000,000 words automatically tagged 
by the Xerox tagger. In the second instance, the algorithm was tested on Lexesp, a 
corpus 7 that contains Spanish literary texts from different genres and by different

of the University of Oviedo and developed by the Computational Linguistics Group of the University 
of Barcelona, with the collaboration fthe Language Processing Group of the Catalonia University of 
Technology, Spain.

authors. These texts were mainly obtained from newspapers and were automatically 
tagged by a different agger than the one used to tag the Blue Book. The portion of 
the Lexesp corpus that we processed contained various stories, related by a narrator, 
and written by different authors. As was the case for the Blue Book corpus, this 
corpus also contained 5,000,000 words. Since we worked on texts from different genres 
and by different authors, the applicability of our proposal to other kinds of texts is 
assured. 
We selected a subset of the Blue Book corpus and another subset of the Lex- 
esp corpus, and both were annotated with respect o coreference. One portion of the 
coreferentially tagged corpus (training corpus) was used for improving the rules for 
anaphora resolution (constraints and preferences), and another portion was reserved 
for test data (Table 2). 
The annotation phase was accomplished in the following manner: (1) two annota- 
tors were selected, (2) an agreement was reached between the annotators with regard 
to the annotation scheme, (3) each annotator annotated the corpus, and, finally, (4) a 
reliability test (Carletta et al. 1997) was done on the annotation in order to guaran- 
tee the results. The reliability test used the kappa statistic that measures agreement 
between the annotations of two annotators in making judgments about categories. In 
this way, the annotation is considered a classification task consisting of defining an ad- 
equate solution among the candidate list. According to Vieira (1998), the classification 
task when tagging anaphora resolution can be reduced to a decision about whether 
each candidate is the solution or not. Thus, two different categories are considered 
for each anaphor: one for the correct antecedent and another for nonantecedents. Our 
experimentation showed one correct antecedent among an average of 14.5 possible 
candidates per anaphor after applying constraints. For computing the kappa statistic 
(k), see Siegel and Castellan (1988). 
According to Carletta et al. (1997), a k measurement such as 0.68 < k < 0.8 allows 
us to draw encouraging conclusions, and a measurement k > 0.8 means there is to- 
tal reliability between the results of the two annotators. In our tests, we obtained a 
kappa measurement of k = 0.81. We therefore consider the annotation obtained for the 
evaluation to be totally reliable. 
4.2 Experimental Work 
We conducted a blind test over the entire test corpus of unrestricted Spanish texts by 
applying the algorithm to the partial syntactic structure generated by the slot unifica- 
tion parser. 
Over these corpora, our algorithm attained a success rate for anaphora resolution 
of 76.8%. We define "success rate" as the number of pronouns successfully resolved, 
divided by the total number of resolved pronouns. The total number of resolved pro- 
nouns was 1,677, including personal, demonstrative, reflexive, and omitted pronouns.

All of them were in the third person, with a noun phrase that appeared before the 
anaphor as their antecedent. Our algorithm's "recall percentage," defined as the num- 
ber of pronouns correctly resolved, divided by the total number of pronouns in the 
text, was therefore 76.8%. A breakdown of success rate results for each kind of pro- 
noun is also shown in Table 3. The pronouns were classified so as to provide the 
option of applying different kinds of knowledge to resolve each category of pronoun. 
One of the factors that affected the results was the complexity of the Lexesp corpus, 
due mainly to its complex narratives. On average, 16 words per sentence and 27 
candidates per anaphor were found in this corpus. 
In our experiment, a "successful resolution" occurred if the head of the solution 
offered by our algorithm was the same as that offered by two human experts. We 
adopted this definition of "success" because it allowed the system to be totally auto- 
matic: solutions given by the annotators were stored in a file and were later automat- 
ically compared with the solutions given by our system. Since semantic information 
was not used at all, PP attachments were not always correctly disambiguated. Hence, 
at times the differences imply corresponded to different subconstituents. 
After the evaluation process, we tested the results in order to identify the lim- 
itations of the algorithm with respect to the resolution process. We identified the 
following: 
• There were some mistakes in the POS tagging (causing an error rate of 
around 3%). 
• There were some mistakes in the partial parsing with respect o the 
identification of complex noun phrases (causing an error rate of around 
7%) (Palomar et al. 1999). 
• Semantic information was not considered (causing an error rate of 
around 32%). An example of this type of error can be seen in the 
following text extracted from the Lexesp corpus: 
(27) Recuerdo, pot ejemplo, \[un pequefio claro en un bosque en 
medio de las montafias canadienses\]i, con tres lagunas diminutas 
que, a causa de los sedimentos del agua. tenfan distintos y chocantes 
colores. Esta rareza habia hecho del sitioi un espacio sagrado al que 
peregrinaron los indios durante siglos y seguramente antes los 
pobladores paleolfticos. Y eso se notaba. 
558 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
(28) 
Canad~i es un pals muy hermoso, y aqu41i no era, ni mucho 
rnenos, el lugar m~s bello: pero guardaba tranquilamente d ntro de sf 
toda su arrnonfa, como los melocotones guardan dentro de sf el duro 
hueso. 
'1 remember, for example, \[a small clearing in the woods in the 
middle of the Canadian mountains\]/, with three tiny lagoons that, 
due to the water sediments, had different and astonishing colors. 
This peculiarity had made the place/into a sacred site, to which the 
Indians made pilgrimages over the centuries, and surely even the 
Paleolithic Indians before them. And you could feel it. 
'Canada is a very beautiful country and that one/was by no 
means the most beautiful place: but it calmly kept within itself all of 
its harmony, like peaches that keep the hard seeds within.' 
In this text, the demonstrative pronoun aqudl 'that one' corefers with the 
antecedent un peque~o claro en un bosque n medio de las monta~as canadienses 
'a small clearing in the woods in the middle of the Canadian mountains', 
which is also linked to the definite noun phrase el sitio 'the place'. Our 
algorithm identified the proper noun Canadd, which is in the same 
sentence, as the anaphor, since the proper noun could only have been 
discarded by means of semantic information. 
As an example of an anaphor that was correctly resolved by the 
algorithm, we present he following sentence xtracted from the Blue 
Book corpus. In this case, the antecedent los sistemas de transmisidn 
analdgica 'the systems of analogue transmission' was correctly chosen for 
the personal pronoun ellos 'them': ' 
En las conexiones largas o de Iongitud media, es probable que la 
fuente principal de ruido de circuito estribe en \[los sistemas de 
transmisi6n anal6gica\]i, ya queen ellosi la potencia de ruido suele 
set proporcional  la Iongitud del circuito. 
'In long or medium connections, it is probable that the main source of 
circuit noise comes from \[the systems of analogue transmission\]/, 
since in them/the noise capacity is usually proportional to the length 
of the circuit.' 
The remainder of the errors were due to split antecedents (10%), 
cataphora (2%), exophora (3%), or exceptions in the application of 
preferences (43%). 
5. Comparison with Other Approaches to Anaphora Resolution 
5.1 Anaphora Resolution Approaches 
Common among all languages i the fact that the anaphora phenomenon requires im- 
ilar strategies for its resolution (e.g., pronouns or definite descriptions). All languages 
employ different kinds of knowledge, but their strategies differ only in the manner by 
which this knowledge is coordinated. For example, in some strategies just one kind 
of knowledge becomes the main selector for identifying the antecedent, with other 
kinds of knowledge being used merely to confirm or reject the proposed antecedent. 
In such cases, the typical kind of knowledge used as the selector is that of discourse 
structure. Centering theory, as employed by Strube and Hahn (1999) or Okumura and 
Tamura (1996), uses this type of approach. Other approaches, however, give equal 
559 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
importance to each kind of knowledge and generally distinguish between constraints 
and preferences (Baldwin 1997; Lappin and Leass 1994; Carbonell and Brown 1988). 
Whereas constraints tend to be absolute and therefore discard possible antecedents, 
preferences tend to be relative and require the use of additional criteria (e.g., the use of 
heuristics that are not always satisfied by all antecedents). Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) 
use this sort of resolution model, which involves the use of semantic and pragmatic 
constraints, such as constraints based on modal expressions, or constraints based on 
verbal semantic attributes or conjunctions. 
Our approach to anaphora resolution belongs in the latter category, since it com- 
bines different kinds of knowledge and no knowledge based on discourse structure 
is included. We choose to ignore discourse structure because obtaining this kind of 
knowledge requires not only an understanding of semantics but also knowledge about 
world affairs and the ability to almost perfectly parse any text under discussion (Az- 
zam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998). 
Still other approaches to anaphora resolution are based either on machine learn- 
ing techniques (Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994; Yamamoto and Sumita 1998; Paul, 
Yamamato, and Sumita 1999) or on the principles of uncertainty reasoning (Mitkov 
1995). 
Computational processing of semantic and domain information is relatively expen- 
sive when compared with other kinds of knowledge. Consequently, current anaphora 
resolution methods rely mainly on constraint and preference heuristics, which employ 
morpho-syntactic information or shallow semantic analysis (see, for example, Mitkov 
\[1998\]). Such approaches have performed notably well. Lappin and Leass (1994) de- 
scribe an algorithm for pronominal anaphora resolution that achieves a high rate of 
correct analyses (85%). Their approach, however, operates almost exclusively on syn- 
tactic information. More recently, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) proposed an algorithm 
for anaphora resolution that is actually a modified and extended version of the one 
developed by Lappin and Leass (1994). It works from the output of a POS tagger and 
achieves an accuracy rate of 75%. 
There are other approaches based on POS tagger outputs as well. For example, 
Mitkov and Stys (1997) propose a knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns 
in technical manuals in both English and Polish. The knowledge mployed in these 
approaches i limited to a small noun phrase grammar, a list of terms, and a set of 
antecedent indicators (definiteness, term preference, lexical reiteration, etc.). 
Still other approaches are based on statistical information, including the work of 
Dagan and Itai (1990, 1991) and Ge, Hale, and Charniak (1998), all of whom present a 
probabilistic model for pronoun resolution. 
We have adopted their ideas and adapted their algorithms to partial parsing and 
to Spanish texts in order to compare our results with their approaches. 
With reference to the differences between English and Spanish anaphora resolu- 
tion, we have made the following observations: 
Syntactic parallelism has played a more important role in English texts 
than in Spanish texts, since Spanish sentence structure is more flexible 
than English sentence structure. Spanish is a free-word-order language 
and has different syntactic onditions, which increases the difficulty of 
resolving Spanish pronouns (hence, the greater accuracy rate for English 
texts). 
• A greater number of possible antecedents was observed for Spanish 
pronouns than for English pronouns, due mainly to the greater average 
560 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
length of Spanish sentences (which also makes the resolution of Spanish 
pronouns more difficult). 
Spanish pronouns usually bear more morphological information. One 
result is that this constraint tends to discard more candidates in Spanish 
than in English. 
For comparison purposes, we implemented the following approaches on the same 
Spanish texts that were tested and described in Section 4.1. 
5.2 Hobbs's Algorithm 
Hobbs's algorithm (Hobbs 1978) is applied to the surface parse trees of sentences in 
a text. A surface parse tree represents the grammatical structure of a sentence. By 
reading the leaves of the parse tree from left to right, the original English sentence is
formed. The algorithm parses the tree in a predefined order and searches for a noun 
phrase of the correct gender and number. Hobbs tested his algorithm for the pronouns 
he, she, it, and they, using 100 examples taken from three different sources. Although 
the algorithm is very simple, it was successful 81.8% of the time. 
We implemented a version of Hobbs's algorithm for slot unification grammar for 
Spanish texts. Since full parsing was not done, our specifications for the algorithm 
were adjusted, as follows: 
• NPs were tested from left to right, as they were parsed in the sentence. 
• Afterward, the NPs that were included in an NP (breadth-first) were 
tested. 
• This test was interrupted when an NP agreed in gender and number 
with the anaphor. 
The problems we encountered in implementing Hobbs's algorithm are similar to 
those found in implementing other approaches: the adaptation to partial parsing, and 
the inherent difficulty of the Spanish language (i.e., its free-word-order characteristics). 
The results of our test of this version of Hobbs's algorithm on the test corpus 
appear in Table 4. 
5.3 Approaches Based on Constraints and Proximity Preference 
Our approach as also been compared with the typical baseline approach consisting of 
constraints and proximity preference; that is, the antecedent that appears closest o the 
anaphor is chosen from among those that satisfy the constraints. For this comparison, 
the same constraints that were used previously (i.e., morphological greement and 
syntactic onditions) were applied here. Then the antecedent a the head of the list of 
antecedents was proposed as the solution of the anaphor. These results are also listed 
in Table 4. As can be seen from the table, success rates were lower than those obtained 
through the joint application of all the preferences. 
5.4 Lappin and Leass's Algorithm 
An algorithm for identifying the noun phrase antecedents of third person pronouns 
and lexical anaphors (reflexive and reciprocal) is presented in Lappin and Leass (1994); 
this algorithm has exhibited a high rate (85%) of correct analyses in English texts. It 
relies on measures of salience that are derived from syntactic structures and on simple 
dynamic models of attentional state to select he antecedent oun phrase of a pronoun 
from a list of candidates. 
561 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
We have implemented a version of Lappin and Leass's algorithm for Spanish texts. 
The original formulation of the algorithm proposes a syntactic filter on NP-pronoun 
coreference. This filter consists of six conditions for NP-pronoun oncoreference within 
any sentence (Lappin and Leass 1994, page 537). In applying this algorithm to Span- 
ish texts, we changed these conditions o as to capture the appropriate context. As 
mentioned previously, our algorithm does not have access to full syntactic knowledge. 
Accordingly, we employed partial parsing over the text in our application of Lappin 
and Leass's algorithm. The salience parameters were weighted (weight appears in 
parentheses) and applied in the following way: 
• Sentence recency (100): Applied when the NP appeared in the same 
sentence as the anaphor. 
• Subject emphasis (80): Applied when the NP was located before the 
verb of the clause in which it appeared. This heuristic was necessary 
because of our algorithm's lack of syntactic knowledge. It should be 
noted, however, that since Spanish is a nearly free-word-order language 
and the exchange of subject and object positions within Spanish 
sentences i common, the heuristic is often invalid. For example, the two 
Spanish sentences Pedro compr6 un regalo 'Pedro bought a present' and Un 
regalo compr6 Pedro 'A present bought Pedro' are equivalent to one 
another and to the English sentence Pedro bought a present. 
• Existential emphasis (70): In this instance, we applied the parameter in 
the same way as Lappin and Leass, since the entire NP was fully parsed, 
which allowed us to tell when it was a definite or an indefinite NP. 
• Accusative emphasis (50): Applied when the NP appeared after the verb 
of the clause in which it appeared and the NP did not appear inside 
another NP or PP. For example, in the sentence Pedro encontr6 el libro de 
Juana 'Pedro found Juana's book', a value was assigned to el libro de Juana 
'Juana's book' but not to Juana. Once again, it should be noted that this 
heuristic was necessary because of our algorithm's lack of syntactic 
knowledge. 
• Indirect object and oblique complement emphasis (40): Applied when 
the NP appeared in a PP with the Spanish preposition a 'to', which 
usually preceded the indirect object of its sentence. 
• Head noun emphasis (80): Applied when the NP was not contained in 
another NP. 
• Nonadverbial emphasis (50): Applied when the NP was not contained 
in an adverbial PP. In this case, its application depended on the kind of 
preposition in which the NP was included. 
• Parallelism reward (35): Applied when the NP occupied the same 
position as the anaphor with reference to the verb of the sentence (before 
or after the verb). 
Finally, we followed Lappin and Leass in assigning the additional salience value 
to NPs in the current sentence and in degrading the salience of NPs in preceding 
sentences. 
Our results exhibited some similarities with Lappin and Leass's experiments. 
For example, anaphora was strongly preferred over cataphora, and both approaches 
562 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
preferred intrasentential NPs to intersentential ones. These results can be seen in 
Table 4. 
5.5 Centering Approach 
The centering model proposed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1995) provides 
a framework for modeling the local coherence of discourse. The model has two con- 
structs, a list of forward-looking centers and a backward-looking center, that can be 
assigned to each utterance Ui. The list of forward-looking centers Cf(Ui) ranks dis- 
course entities within the utterance Ui. The backward-looking center Cb(Ui+l) con- 
stitutes the most highly ranked element of Cf(Ui) that is finally realized in the next 
utterance Ui+l. In this way, the ranking imposed over Cf(Ui) must reflect he fact that 
the preferred center Cp(U/) (i.e., the most highly ranked element of Cf(Ui)) is most 
likely to be Cb(Ui+l). 
The ranking criteria used by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) order items in 
the Cf list using grammatical roles. Thus, entities with a subject role are preferred to 
entities with an object role, and objects are preferred to others (adjuncts, etc.). 
Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) state that if any element of Cf(Ui) is realized 
by a pronoun in Ui+l, then Cb(Ui+l) must also be realized by a pronoun. 
Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) applied the centering model to pronoun 
resolution. They based their algorithm on the fact that centering transition relations 
will hold across adjacent utterances. 
Moreover, one crucial point in centering is the ranking of the forward-looking 
centers. Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) state that Cf may be ordered using different 
factors, but they only use information about grammatical roles. However, both Strube 
(1998) and Strube and Hahn (1999) point out that it is difficult to define grammatical 
roles in free-word-order languages like German or Spanish. For languages like these, 
they propose other anking criteria dependent upon the information status of discourse 
entities. They claim that information about familiarity is crucial for the ranking of 
discourse ntities, at least in free-word-order languages. 
According to Strube's ranking criteria, two different sets of expressions, hearer- 
old discourse ntities (OLD) and hearer-new discourse ntities (NEW), can be distin- 
guished. OLD discourse ntities consist of evoked entities---coreferring resolved ex- 
pressions (pronominal and nominal anaphora, previously mentioned proper names, 
relative pronouns, appositives)--and unused entities (proper names and titles). The re- 
maining entities are assigned to the NEW set. The basic ranking criteria for pronominal 
anaphora resolution prefer OLD entities over NEW entities. 8 
Strube (1998) thus proposes the following adaptation to the centering model: 
The Cf list is replaced by the list of salient discourse ntities (S-list) 
containing discourse ntities that are realized in the current and previous 
utterance. 
• The elements of the S-list are ranked according to the basic ranking 
criteria and position information: 
If X E OLD and y C NEW, then x precedes y. 
If x, y ~ OLD or x, y E NEW, 
8 To resolve functional naphora,  third set, MED, which includes inferable information, must be added 
between the OLD and the NEW sets. However, this set is not needed to resolve pronominal naphora 
(Strube and Hahn 1999).

then if utterance(y) precedes utterance(x), then x precedes y, 
if utterance(y) = utterance(x) and pos(x) < pos(y), then x precedes y. 
Since there is not a clear definition of what an utterance is, the following 
criteria are assumed: tensed clauses are defined as utterances on their 
own and untensed clauses are processed with the main clause in order to 
constitute only one utterance. 
Incorporating these adaptations, Strube (1998) then proposes the following algo- 
rithm: 
1. If a referring expression is encountered, 
(a) if it is a pronoun, test the elements of the S-list in order until the 
test succeeds; 
(b) update the S-list using information about this referring 
expression. 
2. If the analysis of utterance U is finished, remove all discourse ntities 
from the S-list that are not realized in U. 
The evaluation of this algorithm was performed in Strube (1998) and obtained a 
precision of 85.4% for English, improving upon the results of the centering algorithm 
by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), which achieved only 72.9% precision when 
it was applied to the same corpus. 
Consequently, in adapting the centering model to Spanish anaphora resolution, we 
followed Strube's indications. The success rate of the algorithm was not satisfactory, 
as can be seen in Table 4. 
6. Conclus ions 
In this paper, we have presented an algorithm for identifying noun phrase antecedents 
of third person personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, reflexive pronouns, and 
564 
Palomar et al. Anaphora Resolution in Spanish Texts 
omitted pronouns in Spanish. The algorithm is applied to the syntactic structure gen- 
erated by the slot unification parser--see Ferrdndez, Palomar, and Moreno (1998a, 
1998b, 1999)--and coordinates different kinds of knowledge (lexical, morphological, 
and syntactic) by distinguishing between constraints and preferences. 
The main contribution ofthis paper is the introduction ofan algorithm for anaphora 
resolution for Spanish. In our work, we have undertaken an exhaustive study of the 
importance of each kind of knowledge in anaphora resolution for Spanish. Moreover, 
we have developed a definition of syntactic onditions of NP-pronoun noncorefer- 
ence in Spanish with partial parsing. We have also adapted our anaphora resolution 
algorithm to the problem of partial syntactic knowledge, that is to say, when partial 
parsing of the text is accomplished. 
For unrestricted texts, our approach is somewhat less accurate, since semantic 
information is not taken into account. For such texts, we are dealing with the output 
of a POS tagger, which does not provide this sort of knowledge. In order to test our 
approach with texts of different genres by different authors, we have worked with 
two different Spanish corpora, literary texts (the Lexesp corpus) and technical texts 
(the Blue Book), containing a total of 1,677 pronoun occurrences. 
The algorithm successfully identified the antecedent of the pronoun for 76.8% 
of these pronoun occurrences. Other algorithms usually work with different kinds 
of knowledge, different texts, and different languages. In order to make a more valid 
comparison of our algorithm with others, we adapted the other algorithms so that they 
would operate using only partial-parsing knowledge. In this evaluation, our algorithm 
has always obtained better esults. 
Moreover, based on the results on our study of the importance of each kind 
of knowledge, we can emphasize that constraints are very important for resolving 
anaphora successfully, since they considerably reduce the number of possible candi- 
dates. 
In future studies, we will attempt to evaluate the importance of semantic informa- 
tion in unrestricted texts for anaphora resolution in Spanish texts (Saiz-Noeda, Su~rez, 
and Peral 1999). This information will be obtained from a lexical tool (e.g., Spanish 
WordNet), which can be automatically consulted (since the tagger does not provide 
this information).
