Abstract
Code-mixing is frequently observed in
user generated content on social media,
especially from multilingual users. The
linguistic complexity of such content is
compounded by presence of spelling vari-
ations, transliteration and non-adherance
to formal grammar. We describe our
initial efforts to create a multi-level an-
notated corpus of Hindi-English code-
mixed text collated from Facebook fo-
rums, and explore language identifica-
tion, back-transliteration, normalization
and POS tagging of this data. Our re-
sults show that language identification and
transliteration for Hindi are two major
challenges that impact POS tagging accu-
racy.
1 Introduction
Code-Switching and Code-Mixing are typical
and well-studied phenomena of multilingual so-
cieties (Gumperz, 1964; Auer, 1984; Myers-
Scotton, 1993; Danet and Herring, 2007;
Cardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009). Lin-
guists differentiate between the two, where
Code-Switching is juxtaposition within the same
speech exchange of passages of speech be-
longing to two different grammatical systems
or sub-systems (Gumperz, 1982), and Code-
Mixing (CM) refers to the embedding of linguis-
tic units such as phrases, words and morphemes
of one language into an utterance of another lan-
guage (Myers-Scotton, 1993). The first exam-
ple in Fig. 1 features CM where English words
are embedded in a Hindi sentence, whereas the
second example shows codeswitching. Here, we
will use CM to imply both. Work on computa-

crosoft Research India.
tional models of CM have been few and far be-
tween (Solorio and Liu, 2008a; Solorio and Liu,
2008b; Nguyen and Dogruoz, 2013), primarily
due to the paucity of CM data in conventional
text-corpora which makes data-intensive methods
hard to apply. Solorio and Liu (2008a) in their
work on English-Spanish CM use models built on
smaller datasets to predict valid switching points
to synthetically generate data from monolingual
corpora, and in another work (2008b) describe
parts-of-speech (POS) tagging of CM text.
CM though typically observed in spoken lan-
guage is now increasingly more common in text,
thanks to the proliferation of the Computer Me-
diated Communication channels, especially so-
cial media like Twitter and Facebook (Crys-
tal, 2001; Herring, 2003; Danet and Herring,
2007; Cardenas-Claros and Isharyanti, 2009).
Social media content is tremendously important
for studying trends, reviews, events, human-
behaviour as well as linguistic analysis, and there-
fore in recent times has spurred a lot of interest
in automatic processing of such data. Neverthe-
less, CM on social media has not been studied
from a computational aspect. Moreover, social
media content presents additional challenges due
to contractions, non-standard spellings and non-
grammatical constructions. Furthermore, for lan-
guages written in scripts other than Roman, like
Hindi, Bangla, Japanese, Chinese and Arabic, Ro-
man transliterations are typically used for repre-
senting the words (Sowmya et al., 2010). This can
prove a challenge for language identification and
segregation of the two languages.
In this paper, we describe our initial efforts to
POS tag social media content from English-Hindi
(henceforth En-Hi) bilinguals while trying to ad-
dress the challenges of CM, transliteration and
non-standard spelling, as well as lack of anno-
tated data. POS tagging is one of the fundamen-
tal pre-processing steps for NLP, and while there
974
have been works on POS tagging of social media
data (Gimpel et al., 2011; Owoputi et al., 2013)
and of CM (Solorio and Liu, 2008b), but we do
not know of any work on POS tagging of CM
text from social media that involves transliteration.
The salient contributions of this work are in for-
malizing the problem and related challenges for
processing of En-Hi social media data, creation
of an annotated dataset and some initial experi-
ments for language identification, transliteration,
normalization and POS tagging of this data.
2 Corpus Creation
For this study, we collected data from Face-
book public pages of three celebrities: Amitabh
Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, Narendra Modi, and
the BBC Hindi news page. All these pages are
very popular with 1.8 to 15.5 million “likes”. A to-
tal of 40 posts were manually selected from these
pages, which were published between 22nd – 28th
October 2013. The posts having a long thread of
comments (50+) were preferred, because CM and
non-standard usage of language is more common
in the comments. We shall use the term post to re-
fer to either a post or a comment. The corpus thus
created has 6,983 posts and 113,578 words. The
data was semi-automatically cleaned and format-
ted. The user names were removed for anonymity,
but the names appearing in comments, which are
mostly of celebrities, were retained.
2.1 Annotation
There are various interesting linguistic as well as
socio-pragmatic features (e.g., user demograph-
ics, presence of sarcasm or humor, polarity) for
which this corpus could be annotated because CM
is influenced by both linguistic as well as extra-
linguistic features. However, initial attempts at
such detailed and layered annotation soon revealed
the resource-intensiveness of the task. We, thus,
scaled down the annotation to the following four
layers:
Matrix: The posts are split into contiguous
fragments of words such that each fragment has
a unique matrix language (either En or Hi). The
matrix language is defined as the language which
governs the grammatical relation between the con-
stituents of the utterance. Any other language
words that are nested into the matrix constitute the
embedded language(s). Usually, matrix language
can be assigned to clauses or sentences.
Word origin: Every word is marked for its ori-
gin or source language, En or Hi, depending on
whether it is an English or Hindi word. Words that
are of neither Hindi nor English origin are marked
as Ot or Other. Here, we assume that code-mixing
does not happen at sublexical levels, as it is un-
common in this data; Hi and En have a sim-
pler inflectional morphology and thus, sub-lexical
mixing though present (e.g., computeron has
a En root - computer and a Hi plural marker
on) is relatively less common. In languages with
richer morphology and agglutination, like Bangla
and most Dravidian languages, more frequent sub-
lexical mixing may be observed. Also note that
words are borrowed extensively between Hi and
En such that certain English words (e.g., bus,
party, vote etc) are no longer perceived as English
words by the Hindi speakers. However, here we
will not distinguish between CM and borrowing,
and such borrowed English words have also been
labeled as En words.
Normalization/Transliteration: Whenever the
word is in a transliterated form, which is often the
case for the Hi words, it is labeled with the in-
tended word in the native script (e.g., Devanagari
for Hi). If the word is in native script, but uses
a non-standard spelling, it is labeled with the cor-
rect standard spelling. We call this the spelling
normalization layer.
Parts-of-Speech (POS): Finally, each word is
also labeled with its POS. We use the Universal
POS tagset proposed by Petrov et al. (2011) which
has 12 POS tags that are applicable to both En
and Hi. The POS labels are decided based on the
function of a word in the context, rather than a
decontextualized lexical category. This is an im-
portant notion, especially for CM text, because of-
ten the original lexical category of an embedded
word is lost in the context of the matrix language,
and it plays the role of a different lexical category.
Though the Universal POS tagset does not pre-
scribe a separate tag for Named Entities, we felt
the necessity of marking three different kinds of
NEs - people, location and organization, because
almost every comment has one or more NEs and
strictly speaking word origin does not make sense
for these words.
Annotation Scheme: Fig. 1 illustrates the an-
notation scheme through two examples. Each
post is enclosed within <s></s> tags. The
matrices within a post are separated by the
<matrix></matrix> tags which take the matrix
language as an argument. Each word is anno-

tated for POS, and the language (/E or /H for En
or Hi respectively) only if it is different from the
language of the matrix. In case of non-standard
spelling in English, the correct spelling is ap-
pended as “sol NOUN=soul”, while for the
Hindi words, the correct Devanagari translitera-
tion is appended. The NEs are marked with the
tags P (person), L (location) or O (organization)
and multiword NEs are enclosed within square
brackets “[]”.
A random subsample of 1062 posts consisting
of 10171 words were annotated by a linguist who
is a native speaker of Hi and proficient in En. The
annotations were reviewed and corrected by two
experts linguists. During this phase, it was also
observed that a large number of comments were
very short, typically an eulogism of their favorite
celebrity and hence were not interesting from a
linguistic point of view. For our experiments, we
removed all posts that had fewer than 5 words.
The resulting corpus had 381 comments/posts and
4135 words.
2.2 CM Distribution
Most of the posts (93.17%) are in Roman script,
and only 2.93% were in Devanagari. Around 3.5%
of the posts contain words in both the scripts (typ-
ically a post in Devanagari with hashtags or urls in
Roman script), and a very small fraction of the text
(0.4% of comments/posts and 0.6% words) was in
some other script. The fraction of words present
in Roman and Devanagri scripts are 80.76% and
15.32% respectively, which shows that the De-
vanagari posts are relatively longer than the Ro-
man posts. Due to their relative rarity, the posts
containing words in Devanagari or any other script
were not considered for annotation.
In the annotated data, 1102 sentences are in a
single matrix (398 Hi, 698 En and 6 Ot) and in
45 posts there is at least one switch of matrix
(mostly between Hi and En. Thus, 4.2% of the
data shows code-switching. This is a strict defi-
nition of code-switching; if we consider a change
in matrix within a conversation thread as a code-
switch, then in this data all the threads exhibit
code-switching. However, out of the 398 com-
ments in Hi-matrix, 23.37% feature CM (i.e., they
have at least one or more non-Hi (or rather, al-
most always En) words embedded. On the other
hand, only 7.34% En-matrix comments feature
CM (again almost always with Hi). Thus, a total
of 17.2% comments/posts, which contains a quar-
ter of all the words in the annotated corpus, fea-
ture either CM or code-switching or both. We also
note that more than 40% words in the corpus are
in Hi or other Indian languages, but written in Ro-
man script; hence, they are in transliterated form.
See (Bali et al., 2014) for an in-depth discussion
on the characteristics of the CM data.
This analysis demonstrates the necessity of CM
and transliterated text processing in the context of
Indian user-generated social media content. Per-
haps, the numbers are not too different for such
content generated by the users of any other bilin-
gual and multilingual societies.
3 Models and Experiments

the native script. Additionaly, since we are work-
ing with content from social media, the usage of
non-standard spelling is rampant and thus, nor-
malization of text into some standard form is re-
quired. Ideally, these tasks should be performed
jointly since they are interdependent. However,
due to lack of resources, we implement a pipelined
approach in which the tasks - language identifica-
tion, text normalization and POS tagging - are per-
formed sequentially, in that order. This pipelined
approach also allows us to use various off-the-
shelf tools for solving these subtasks and quickly
create a baseline system. The baseline results can
also provide useful insight into the inherent hard-
ness of POS tagging of code-mixed social media
text. In this section, we first describe our approach
to solve these three tasks, and then discuss the ex-
periments and results.
3.1 Language identification
Langauge identification is a well studied prob-
lem (King and Abney, 2013; Carter et al., 2013;
Goldszmidt et al., 2013; Nguyen and Dogruoz,
2013), though for CM text, especially those in-
volving transliterations and orthographic varia-
tion, this is far from a solved problem (Nguyen and
Dogruoz, 2013). There was a shared task in FIRE
2013 (Saha Roy et al., 2013) on language iden-
tification and back transliteration for En mixed
with Hi, Bangla and Gujarati. Along the lines
of Gella et al (Gella et al., 2013), which was the
best performing system in this shared task, we
used the word-level logistic regression classifier
built by King and Abney (2013). This system pro-
vides a source language with a confidence prob-
ability for each word in the test set. We trained
the classifier on 3201 English words extracted
from the SMS corpus developed by Choudhury
et al (2007), while the Hindi data was obtained
by sampling 3218 Hindi transliterations out of the
En-Hi transliteration pairs developed by Sowmya
et al. (Sowmya et al., 2010). Ideally, the context of
a token is important for identifying the language.
Again, following (Gella et al., 2013) we incorpo-
rate context information through a code-switching
probability, P
s
. A higher value of P
s
implies a
lower probability of code-switching, i.e., adjacent
words are more likely to be in the same language.
Table 1 shows the token (word) level confusion
matrix for the language identification task on our
dataset. The language labels of 84.6% of the to-
kens were correctly predicted by the system. As
can be seen from the Table, the precision for pre-
dicting Hi is high, whereas that for En is low. This
is mainly due to the presence of a large number of
contracted and distorted Hi words in the dataset,
e.g. h for hai (Fig. 1), which were tagged as
En by our system because the training examples
had no contracted Hi words, but short and non-
conventional spellings were in plenty in the En
training examples as those were extracted from the
SMS corpus.
3.2 Normalization
In our dataset, if a word is identified as Hi, then
it must be back-transliterated to Devanagari script
so that any off-the-shelf Hindi POS tagger can be
used. We used the system by Gella et al. (Gella
et al., 2013) for this task, which is part rule-based
and part statistical. The system was trained on the
35000 unique transliteration pairs extracted from
Hindi song lyrics (Gupta et al., 2012). This corpus
has a reasonably wide coverage of Hindi words,
and past researchers have also shown that translit-
eration does not require a very large amount of
training data. Normalization of the En text was
not needed because the POS tagger (Owoputi et
al., 2013) could handle unnormalized text.
3.3 POS tagging
Solorio and Liu (2008b) describes a few ap-
proaches to POS-tagging of code-switched Span-
glish text, all of which primarily relies on two
monolingual taggers and certain heuristics to com-
bine the output from the two. One of the sim-
pler heuristics is based on language identification,
where the POS tag of a word is the output of the
monolingual tagger of the language in which the
word is. In this initial study, we apply this ba-
sic idea for POS tagging of CM data. We divide
the text (which is already sentence-separated) into
contiguous maximal chunks of words which are in
the same language. Then we apply a Hi POS tag-
ger to the Hi chunks, and an En POS tagger to the
En chunks.

3 NK NK Twitter 44.74 80.68 65.39 40.00 13.17 25.00
Table 2: POS Tagging accuracies for the different models. K=Known, NK = Not Known. LI = Language
labels, HN = Hindi normalized forms, Acc. = Token level accuracy, CA = Chunk level accuracy.
We use a CRF++ based POS tagger for Hi,
which is freely available from http://nltr.
org/snltr-software/. For En, we use the
Twitter POS tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013). It
also has an inbuilt tokenizer and can work di-
rectly on unnormalized text. This tagger has been
chosen because Facebook posts and comments
are more Twitter-like. We also use the Stanford
POS Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003) which, un-
like the Twitter POS Tagger, has not been tuned
for Twitter-like text. These taggers use different
tagsets - the ILPOST for Hi (Sankaran et al., 2008)
and Penn-TreeBank for En (Marcus et al., 1993).
The output tags are appropriately mapped to the
smaller Universal tagset (Petrov et al., 2011).
3.4 Experiments and Results
We conducted three different experiments as fol-
lows. In the first experiment, we assume that
we know the language identities and normal-
ized/transliterated forms of the words, and only do
the POS tagging. This experiment gives us an idea
of the accuracy of POS tagging task, if normal-
ization, transliteration and language identification
could be done perfectly. We conduct this exper-
iments with two different En POS taggers: the
Stanford POS tagger which is trained on formal
English text (Model 1a) and the Twitter POS tag-
ger (Model 1b). In the next experiment (Model
2), we assume that only the language identity of
the words are known, but for Hindi we apply our
model to generate the back transliterations. For
English, we apply the Twitter POS tagger directly
because it can handle unnormalized social media
text. The third experiment (Model 3) assumes that
nothing is known. So language identifier is first
applied, and based on the language detected, we
apply the Hi translitertaion module, and Hi POS
tagger, or the En tagger. This is the most chal-
lenging and realistic setting. Note that the matrix
information is not used in any of our experiments,
though it could be potentially useful for POS tag-
ging and could be explored in future.
Table 2 gives a summary of the four models
along with the POS tagging accuracies (in %). It
shows token level as well as chunk leve accuracies
(CA), i.e., what percentage of chunks have been
correctly POS tagged. As can be seen, Hi POS
tagging has relatively low accuracies than En POS
tagging at word level for all cases. This is primar-
ily due to the errors of the transliteration module,
which in turn, is because the transliteration does
not address spelling contractions. This is also re-
flected in the drop in the accuracies for the case
where LI is unknown. The very low CA for En
for model 3 is primarily because some of the Hi
chunks are incorrectly identified as En by the lan-
guage identification module (see Table 1). How-
ever, the gradual drop of token and chunk level
accuracies from model 1 to model 3 clearly shows
the effect of gradual error accumulation from each
of the modules. We observe that Nouns were
usually confused most with Verbs and vice versa,
while the Adj were mostly confused with Nouns,
Pronouns with Determiners, and Adpositions with
Conjunctions.
4 Conclusion
This is a work in progress. We have identified
normalization and transliteration as two very chal-
lenging problems for En-Hi CM text. Joint mod-
elling of language identification, normalization,
transliteration as well as POS tagging is expected
to yield better results. We plan to continue our
work in that direction, specifically for conversa-
tional text in social media in a multilingual con-
text. CM is a common phenomenon found in all
bilingual and multilingual societies. The issue of
transliteration exist for most of the South Asian
languages as well as many other languages such as
Arabic and Greek, which use a non-Roman based
script (Gupta et al., 2014). The challenges and is-
sues identified in this study are likely to hold for
many other languages as well, which makes this a
very important and globally prevalent problem.
