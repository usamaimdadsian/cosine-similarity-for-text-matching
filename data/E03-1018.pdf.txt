Abstract
In this paper we present a proposal to ex-
tend WordNet-like lexical databases by
adding phrasets, i.e. sets of free combina-
tions of words which are recurrently used
to express a concept (let's call them re-
current free phrases). Phrasets are a use-
ful source of information for different
NLP tasks, and particularly in a multilin-
gual environment to manage lexical gaps.
Two experiments are presented to check
the possibility of acquiring recurrent free
phrases from dictionaries and corpora.
1 Introduction
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a popular lexical
database for English in which content words are
organized into sets of synonyms (synsets), each
representing one underlying lexical concept.
Words and concepts are further connected
through various lexical and semantic relations.
WordNet has been widely adopted in the NLP
community for a variety of practical tasks such as
word sense disambiguation, question answering,
information retrieval, summarization, etc. The
English WordNet database is being used as a ba-
sis for the development of different multilingual
databases such as EuroWordNet, MultiWordNet,
and the recent BalkaNet project. To make it more
useful in NLP applications, WordNet is con-
stantly updated and extended with different kinds
of information such as domain information, syn-
tactic information, topic signatures, syntactic
parsing and PoS tagging of the glosses, etc.
In this paper we propose to extend the Word-
Net model by adding a new data structure called
phraset. A phraset is a set of free combinations of
words (as opposed to lexical units) which are
recurrently used to express a concept.
Phrasets can provide useful information for
different kind of NLP tasks, both in a monolin-
gual and multilingual environment. For instance,
phrasets can be useful for knowledge-based word
alignment of parallel corpora, to find correspon-
dences when one language has a lexical unit for a
concept whereas the other language uses a free
combination of words.
Another task which could take advantage of
phrasets is word sense disambiguation. The ex-
pressions contained in phrasets are free combina-
tions of possibly ambiguous words, which are
used in one of the regular senses recorded in
WordNet. Take for instance the Italian expres-
sion "campo di grano" (cornfield). Its compo-
nent words are highly ambiguous: "campo" has
12 different senses and "grano" 9, but in this ex-
pression they are used in just one of their usual
senses. Now, suppose that when adding an ex-
pression to a phraset, we annotate the component
words with the WordNet sense they have in the
expression; then when performing word sense
disambiguation, we only need to recognize the
occurrence of the expression in a text to auto-
matically disambiguate its component words.
We are currently studying the integration of
phrasets in the framework of MultiWordNet (Pi-
anta et al., 2002), a multilingual lexical database
in which an Italian wordnet has been created in
strict alignment with the Princeton WordNet.
To enrich the Italian lexical database with
phrasets, we explored techniques exploiting both
machine-readable bilingual dictionaries and cor-
pora. The results of two preliminary experiments
will be presented in Section 4.
2 Lexical units in WordNet
Following the Princeton WordNet model adopted
in MultiWordNet, synsets can include both single
67
words and multiwords which are idioms or re-
stricted collocations. See Sag et al. (2002) for a
recent discussion on the linguistic status of mul-
tiword expressions.
An idiom is a relatively frozen expression
whose meaning cannot be built compositionally
from the meanings of its component words. Also,
the component words cannot be substituted with
synonyms. The following examples are taken
from MultiWordNet: E- stands for the English
wordnet and I- for the Italian one.
E-syn set rollercoaster, big dipper, ... }
I-synset {montagne_russe }
A restricted collocation is a sequence of words
which habitually co-occur and whose meaning
can be derived compositionally. Restricted collo-
cations have a kind of semantic cohesion mainly
due to use and, therefore, they considerably limit
the substitution of their component words. Usu-
ally, restricted collocations do not have a literal
translation in other languages.
E-synset {criminal_record, record}
I-synset {precedenti_penali }
Idioms and restricted collocations must be
distinguished from free combinations of words.
A free combination is a combination of words
following only the general rules of syntax: the
elements are not bound specifically to each other
and so they occur with other lexical items freely
(Benson et al., 1986).
While idioms and restricted collocations are
lexical units, free combinations do not belong to
the lexicon and thus cannot compose synsets in
MultiWordNet.
However, as the boundaries between idioms,
restricted collocations, and free combinations are
not clear-cut, it is sometimes very difficult to
properly distinguish a restricted collocation from
a free combination of words. Moreover, applying
this distinction in a rigorous manner leads to the
consequence that a considerable number of ex-
pressions which are recurrently used to express a
concept are excluded from Multi WordNet as they
are not lexical units.
For example, the English verb "to bike" is al-
ways translated in Italian with "andare in bici-
cletta" but the Italian translation equivalent
seems to be a free combination of the word "an-
dare" in one of its regular senses (dictionary defi-
nition: to move by walking or using a means of
locomotion) with the restricted collocation "in
bicicletta" (by bike). The same holds for the Ital-
ian phrases "punta di freccia" and "punta della
freccia" which can hardly be considered re-
stricted collocations but are recurrently used to
translate the English word "arrowhead".
3 Introducing Phrasets
To be able to include in our lexical database ex-
pressions such as "andare in bicicletta" or "punta
di freccia", we propose to extend the (Multi)
WordNet model by adding phrasets. A phraset is
a set of free combinations of words which are
recurrently used to express a concept. Let's call
the members of a phraset recurrent free phrases.
In a multilingual perspective, phrasets are very
useful to manage lexical gaps, i.e. cases in which
a language expresses a concept with a lexical unit
whereas the other language does not.
In the current version of MultiWordNet we
represent lexical gaps by adding an empty synset
aligned with a non-empty synset of the other lan-
guage. The free combination of words expressing
the non lexicalized concept is added to the gloss
of the empty synset, where it is not distinguished
from definitions and examples.
With the introduction of phrasets, the transla-
tion equivalents expressing the lexical gaps
would have a different status, as it is shown in
the examples below.
E-synset
	 { cornfield}
I-synset	 { GAP }
I-phraset	 campo_di_grano }
E-synset
	 { toilet_roll}
I-synset
	 { GAP }
I-phraset	 rotolo_di_cartaigienica }
Phrasets are also useful in connection with non
empty synsets to give further information about
alternative ways to express/translate a concept.
E-synset
	 { dishcloth}
I-synset	 canovaccio }
I-phraset	 strofinaccio_dei_piatti,
strofinaccio_da_cucina }

3.1 Recurrent Free	 Phrases versus
Definitions
It is important to stress that phrasets contain only
free combinations which are recurrently used,
and not definitions of concepts, which must be
included in the gloss of the synset.
E-synset
	 {tree}
I-synset	 albero ogni pianta perenne con fusto
legnoso ramificato }
I-phraset	
--
E-synset	 {paperboy}
I-synset	 {GAP ragazzo che recapita i giornali }
I-phraset	 ragazzo_dei_giornali }
E-synset	 {straphanger }
I-synset
	 {GAP -- chi viaggia in piedi su mezzi
pubblici reggendosi ad un sostegno }
I-phraset	
--
When the synset in the target language is
empty and no expression is found in the phraset,
this means that the target language lacks a syno-
nym translation equivalent. The definition allows
to understand the concept, but it is unlikely to be
used to translate it.
4 Recurrent Free Phrases in Dictionaries
and Corpora
We did some experiments to verify the possibil-
ity of acquiring recurrent free phrases both from
dictionaries and from corpora.
4.1 Bilingual Dictionaries
For each word sense, bilingual dictionaries pro-
vide one or more translation equivalents (TEs),
which can be a single word or a complex expres-
sion. Some of the complex expressions are lexi-
cal units (idioms or restricted collocations), other
are free combinations of words. When none of
the TEs of the word sense in the source language
is a lexical unit, a lexical gap occurs in the target
language. Bentivogli and Pianta (2000) analyzed
the English to Italian section of the Collins bilin-
gual dictionary and found that 92.2% of the Eng-
lish word senses correspond to at least an Italian
lexical unit, whereas 7.8% correspond to an Ital-
ian lexical gap (all the TEs are free combinations
of words).
Starting from the results of this study, we car-
ried out an experiment to verify in how many
cases the free combinations of words provided by
the Collins as TEs to express an Italian lexical
gap include at least a recurrent free phrase. By
manually checking 300 Italian lexical gaps, a
lexicographer found out that in 67% of the cases
the TEs include a recurrent free phrase. In the
remaining cases the TEs are definitions. We can
use the result of this experiment to infer that
more than half of the synsets which are gaps in
the Italian section of MultiWordNet potentially
have an associated phraset.
In Section 3 we saw that phrasets can be asso-
ciated also to regular (non empty) synsets. To
assess the extension of this phenomenon, we first
looked for cases in which the Collins dictionary
presents an Italian TE composed of a single
word, together with at least a TE composed of a
complex expression. This happens in 2,004 cases
(12% of the total). A lexicographer manually
checked 300 of these complex expressions and
determined that in 52% of the cases at least one
complex expression is a recurrent free phrase. In
the remaining cases the complex expressions
provided as TEs are either lexical units or defini-
tions.
During the manual control, in order to distin-
guish between recurrent free phrases and defini-
tions, the lexicographer used the web to check if
the expression provided by the dictionary is
really used in general language.
4.2 Corpora
A second experiment has been carried out on
an Italian corpus to compare complex lexical
units and recurrent free phrases from a frequency
point of view, and thus to assess the possibility of
extracting recurrent free phrases from corpora
with techniques similar to those used for colloca-
tion extraction. More specifically, we considered
contiguous bigrams and trigrams. A standard
package for the analysis of n-grams has been
used (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003).
First we extracted from a 2 year newspaper
corpus of 32 million words all the bigrams with
frequency higher than 3. A list of stop words has
been used to exclude from the final list all bi-
grams containing at least one function word. This
yielded a list of 118,464 bigrams, ordered ac-
69
cording to the number of occurrences (rank). The
highest rank turned out to be 5,914 (the bigram
"New York" occurs 5,914 times in the corpus),
the lowest rank (4) included 31,453 bigrams
(26,5% of the total). The 497 distinct ranks oc-
curring in the frequency list have been divided
into 9 groups with the following ranges (in paren-
thesis the number of bigrams included in the
group): A: 5,914-509 (100); B: 505-257 (257); C:
256-129 (731); D: 128-65 (1,956); E: 64-33
(4,525); F: 32-17 (10,477); G: 16-9 (22,167); H:
8-5 (46,798); I: 4 (31,453). A lexicographer
manually checked the first 100 bigrams of each
group, classifying them in three groups: lexical
units, recurrent free phrases, other. The following
table summarizes the results of the manual check:
A BCDEF GI-II
Lex. Unit 82 79 74 65 58 55 42 35 28
R. F. P. 14 4 9 14 17 4 15 3 15
Other 4 17 17 21 25 41 43 58 57
The table shows that, as expected, the number
of bigrams that are lexical units decreases regu-
larly along with the rank of the frequency,
whereas non lexical units increase complemen-
tary. However, within non-lexical units the num-
ber of recurrent free phrases seems not to be
correlated with the rank of the bigrams, fluctuat-
ing irregularly between a mininum of 3 and a
maximum of 15. A similar experiment carried out
on trigrams gave very similar result.
5 Open Issues
Introducing phrasets will not solve all the prob-
lems related to the inclusion of multiword ex-
pressions in MultiWordNet. In some cases it will
still be difficult to decide which expressions are
to be included in synsets, which ones in phrasets
and which ones are just definitions. For example,
the English word "backyard" can be translated in
Italian with "giardino posteriore", "giardino sul
retro", "giardino sul retro della casa". The first
two expressions are on the borderline between
synset and phraset, while the third is on the bor-
derline between phraset and definition.
However in most cases phrasets provide a
flexible tool to aid lexicographers in the process
of choosing the lexical status of multiword ex-
pressions. Moreover, phrasets store information
which otherwise would be lost and which is use-
ful for NLP applications.
6 Conclusion
We presented a proposal to extend the (Multi)
WordNet model with phrasets, which requires the
inclusion in the lexical database of expression
that are not lexical units. Such expressions are
useful to handle lexical gaps in multilingual da-
tabases, but can also be added to regular synsets
to provide alternative ways to express/translate a
concept. The information contained in phrasets
can be used to enhance word sense disambigua-
tion algorithms, provided that each expression of
the phraset is annotated with the specific mean-
ing that its component words assume in the
expression. Evidence has been provided that
recurrent free expressions can be extracted from
both bilingual dictionaries and corpora with tech-
niques similar to those used for collocation ex-
traction.
