Abstract
We present an empirical study on the use
of semantic information for Concept Seg-
mentation and Labeling (CSL), which is
an important step for semantic parsing.
We represent the alternative analyses out-
put by a state-of-the-art CSL parser with
tree structures, which we rerank with a
classifier trained on two types of seman-
tic tree kernels: one processing structures
built with words, concepts and Brown
clusters, and another one using semantic
similarity among the words composing the
structure. The results on a corpus from the
restaurant domain show that our semantic
kernels exploiting similarity measures out-
perform state-of-the-art rerankers.
1 Introduction
Spoken Language Understanding aims to inter-
pret user utterances and to convert them to logical
forms or, equivalently, to database queries, which
can then be used to satisfy the user’s information
needs. This process is known as Concept Segmen-
tation and Labeling (CSL), also called semantic
parsing in the speech community: it maps utter-
ances into meaning representations based on se-
mantic constituents. The latter are basically word
sequences, often referred to as concepts, attributes
or semantic tags. CSL makes it easy to convert
spoken questions such as “cheap lebanese restau-
rants in doha with take out” into database queries.
First, a language-specific semantic parser tok-
enizes, segments and labels the question:
[
Price
cheap] [
Cuisine
lebanese] [
Other
restaurants in]
[
City
doha] [
Other
with] [
Amenity
take out]
Then, label-specific normalizers are applied to
the segments, with the option to possibly relabel
mislabeled segments:
[
Price
low] [
Cuisine
lebanese] [
City
doha] [
Amenity
carry out]
Finally, a database query is formed from the list
of labels and values, and is then executed against
the database, e.g., MongoDB; a backoff mecha-
nism may be used if the query has not succeeded.
{$and [{cuisine:"lebanese"},{city:"doha"},
{price:"low"},{amenity:"carry out"}]}
The state-of-the-art of CSL is represented by
conditional models for sequence labeling such as
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et
al., 2001) trained with simple morphological and
lexical features. The basic CRF model was im-
proved by means of reranking (Moschitti et al.,
2006; Dinarelli et al., 2012) using structural ker-
nels (Moschitti, 2006). Although these meth-
ods exploited sentence structure, they did not use
syntax at all. More recently, we applied shal-
low syntactic structures and discourse parsing with
slightly better results (Saleh et al., 2014). How-
ever, the most obvious models for semantic pars-
ing, i.e., rerankers based on semantic structural
kernels (Bloehdorn and Moschitti, 2007b), had not
been applied to semantic structures yet.
In this paper, we study the impact of semantic
information conveyed by Brown Clusters (BCs)
(Brown et al., 1992) and semantic similarity, while
also combining them with innovative features. We
use reranking, similarly to (Saleh et al., 2014),
to select the best hypothesis annotated with con-
cepts predicted by a local model. The competing
hypotheses are represented as innovative trees en-
riched with the semantic concepts and BC labels.
The trees can capture dependencies between sen-
tence constituents, concepts and BCs. However,
extracting explicit features from them is rather
difficult as their number is exponentially large.
Thus, we rely on (i) Support Vector Machines
(Joachims, 1999) to train the reranking functions
and on (ii) structural kernels (Moschitti, 2010;
Moschitti, 2012; Moschitti, 2013) to automatically
encode tree fragments that represent syntactic and
semantic dependencies from words and concepts.
436
(a) Semantic Kernel Structure (SKS)
(b) SKS with Brown Clusters
Figure 1: CSL structures: standard and with Brown Clusters.
We further apply a semantic kernel (SK),
namely the Smoothed Partial Tree Kernel (Croce
et al., 2011), which uses the lexical similarity be-
tween the tree nodes, while computing the sub-
structure space. This is the first time that SKs are
applied to reranking hypotheses. This (i) makes
the global sentence structure along with concepts
available to the learning algorithm, and (ii) enables
computing the similarity between lexicals in syn-
tactic patterns that are enriched by concepts.
We tested our models on the Restaurant do-
main. Our results show that: (i) The basic CRF
parser, which uses semi-Markov CRF, or semi-
CRF (Sarawagi and Cohen, 2004), is already very
accurate; it achieves F
1
scores over 83%, mak-
ing any further improvement very hard. (ii) The
upper-bound performance of the reranker is very
high as well, i.e., the correct annotation is gen-
erated in the list of the first 100 hypotheses in
98.72% of the cases. (iii) SKs significantly im-
prove over the semi-CRF baseline and our pre-
vious state-of-the-art reranker exploiting shallow
syntactic patterns (Saleh et al., 2014), as shown
by extensive comparisons using several systems.
(iv) Making BCs effective requires a deeper study.
2 Related Work
One of the early approaches to CSL was that
of Pieraccini et al. (1991), where the word se-
quences and concepts were modeled using Hid-
den Markov Models (HMMs) as observations and
hidden states, respectively. Generative models
were exploited by Seneff (1989) and Miller et
al. (1994), who used stochastic grammars for
CSL. Other discriminative models followed such
preliminary work, e.g., (Rubinstein and Hastie,
1997; Santaf´e et al., 2007; Raymond and Riccardi,
2007). CRF-based models are considered to be the
state of the art in CSL (De Mori et al., 2008).
Another relevant line of research are the seman-
tic kernels, i.e., kernels that use lexical similarity
between features. One of the first that applyed
LSA was (Cristianini et al., 2002), whereas (Bloe-
hdorn et al., 2006; Basili et al., 2006) used Word-
Net. Semantic structural kernels of the type we
use in this paper were first introduced in (Bloe-
hdorn and Moschitti, 2007a; Bloehdorn and Mos-
chitti, 2007b). The most advanced model based on
tree kernels, which we also use in this paper, is the
Smoothed PTK (Croce et al., 2011).
3 Reranking for CSL
Reranking is applied to a list of N annotation hy-
potheses, which are generated and sorted by the
probability to be globally correct as estimated us-
ing local classifiers or global classifiers that only
use local features. Then, a reranker, typically a
meta-classifier, tries to select the best hypothe-
sis from the list. The reranker can exploit global
information, and specifically, the dependencies
between the different concepts, which are made
available by the local model. We use semi-CRFs
for the local model as they yield the highest ac-
curacy in CSL (when using a single model) and
preference reranking for the global reranker.
3.1 Preference Reranking (PR)
PR uses a classifier C, which takes a pair of hy-
potheses ?H
i
, H
j
? and decides whether H
i
is bet-
ter than H
j
. Given a training question Q, posi-
tive and negative examples are built for training
the classifier. Let H
1
be the hypothesis with the
lowest error rate with respect to the gold standard
among all hypotheses generated for question Q.
We adopt the following approach for example gen-
eration: the pairs ?H
1
, H
i
? (i = 2, 3, . . . , N ) are
positive examples, while ?H
i
, H
1
? are considered
negative.
437
At testing time, given a new question Q
?
, C clas-
sifies all pairs ?H
i
, H
j
? generated from the anno-
tation hypotheses of Q
?
: a positive classification is
a vote for H
i
, otherwise the vote is for H
j
, where
the classifier score can be used as a weighted vote.
H
k
are then ranked according to the number (sum)
of the votes (weighted by score) they receive.
We build our reranker with SVMs using the
following kernel: K(?H
1
, H
2
?, ?H
?
1
, H
?
2
?) =
?(?H
1
, H
2
?) · ?(?H
?
1
, H
?
2
?) ,
(
?(H
1
) ?
?(H
2
)
)
·
(
?(H
?
1
) ? ?(H
?
2
)
)
= ?(H
1
)?(H
?
1
) +
?(H
2
)?(H
?
2
) ? ?(H
1
)?(H
?
2
) ? ?(H
2
)?(H
?
1
) =
S(H
1
, H
?
1
) + S(H
2
, H
?
2
) ? S(H
1
, H
?
2
) ?
S(H
2
, H
?
1
). We consider H as a tuple ?T,~v? com-
posed of a tree T and a feature vector ~v. Then, we
define S(H,H
?
) = S
TK
(T, T
?
)+S
v
(~v,~v
?
), where
S
TK
computes one of the tree kernel functions
defined in 3.2 and 3.3; and S
v
is a kernel (see 3.4),
e.g., linear, polynomial, Gaussian, etc.
3.2 Tree kernels (TKs)
TKs measure the similarity between two structures
in terms of the number of substructures they share.
We use two types of tree kernels: (i) Partial Tree
Kernel (PTK), which can be effectively applied
to both constituency and dependency parse trees
(Moschitti, 2006). It generates all possible con-
nected tree fragments, e.g., sibling nodes can be
also separated and can be part of different tree
fragments: a fragment is any possible tree path,
and other tree paths are allowed to depart from its
nodes. Thus, it can generate a very rich feature
space. (ii) The smoothed PTK or semantic kernel
(SK) (Croce et al., 2011), which extends PTK by
allowing soft matching (i.e., via similarity compu-
tation) between nodes associated with different but
related lexical items. The node similarity can be
derived from manually annotated resources, e.g.,
WordNet or Wikipedia, as well as using corpus-
based clustering approaches, e.g., latent semantic
analysis (LSA), as we do in this paper.
3.3 Semantic structures
Tree kernels allow us to compute structural simi-
larities between two trees; thus, we engineered a
special structure for the CSL task. In order to cap-
ture the structural dependencies between the se-
mantic tags,
1
we use a basic tree (see for exam-
ple Figure 1a), where the words of a sentence are
tagged with their semantic tags.
1
They are associated with the following IDs: 0-Other,
1-Rating, 2-Restaurant, 3-Amenity, 4-Cuisine, 5-Dish, 6-
Hours, 7-Location, and 8-Price.
More specifically, the words in the sentence
constitute the leaves of the tree, which are in
turn connected to the pre-terminals containing
the semantic tags in BIO notation (‘B’=begin,
‘I’=inside, ‘O’=outside). The BIO tags are then
generalized in the upper level, and joined to the
Root node. Additionally, part-of-speech (POS)
tags
2
are added to each word by concatenating
it with the string “::L”, where L is the first let-
ter of the POS-tags of the words, e.g., along, my
and route, receive i, p and n, which are the first
letters of the POS-tags IN, PRN and NN, respec-
tively. SK applied to the above structure can gen-
erate powerful semantic patterns such as [Root
[4-Cuisine [similar to(stake house)]][7-Loc [simi-
lar to(within a mile)]]], e.g., for correctly labeling
new clauses like Pizza Parlor in three kilometers.
The BC labels, represented as cluster IDs, are sim-
ply added as siblings of words as shown in Fig. 1b.
3.4 Feature Vectors
For the sake of comparison, we also devoted
some effort towards engineering a set of features
to be used in a flat feature-vector representation.
These features can be used in isolation to learn
the reranking function, or in combination with the
kernel-based approach (as a composite kernel us-
ing a linear combination). They belong to the fol-
lowing four categories: (i) CRF-based: these in-
clude the basic features used to train the initial
semi-CRF model; (ii) n-gram based: we collected
3- and 4-grams of the output label sequence at
the level of concepts, with artificial tags inserted
to identify the start (‘S’) and end (‘E’) of the se-
quence.
3
(iii) Probability-based, computing the
probability of the label sequence as an average of
the probabilities at the word level in the N -best
list; and (iv) DB-based: a single feature encoding
the number of results returned from the database
when constructing a query using the conjunction
of all semantic segments in the hypothesis.
4 Experiments
The experiments aim at investigating the role of
feature vectors, PTK, SK and BCs in reranking.
We first describe the experimental setting and then
we move into the analysis of the results.
2
We use the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
3
For instance, if the output sequence is Other-Rating-
Other-Amenity the 3-gram patterns would be: S-Other-
Rating, Other-Rating-Other, Rating-Other-Amenity, and
Other-Amenity-E.

4.1 Experimental setup
Dataset. In our experiments, we used questions
annotated with semantic tags, which were col-
lected through crowdsourcing on Amazon Me-
chanical Turk and made available
4
by McGraw et
al. (2012). We split the dataset into training, de-
velopment and test sets. Table 1 shows the num-
ber of examples and example pairs we used for
the semi-CRF and the reranker, respectively. We
subsequently split the training data randomly into
10 folds. We used cross-validation, i.e., iteratively
training with 9 folds and annotating the remaining
fold, in order to generate the N -best lists of hy-
potheses for the entire training dataset. We com-
puted the 100-best hypotheses for each example.
We then used the development dataset to test and
tune the hyper-parameters of our reranking model.
The results on the development set, which we will
present in Section 4.2 below, were obtained us-
ing semi-CRF and reranking models trained on the
training set.
Data representation. Each hypothesis is repre-
sented by a semantic tree, a feature vector (ex-
plained in Section 3), and two extra features:
(i) the semi-CRF probability of the hypothesis,
and (ii) its reciprocal rank in the N -best list.
Learning algorithm. We used the SVM-Light-
TK
5
to train the reranker with a combination of
tree kernels and feature vectors (Moschitti, 2006;
Joachims, 1999). We used the default parameters
and a linear kernel for the feature vectors. As a
baseline, we picked the best-scoring hypothesis in
the list, i.e., the output by the regular semi-CRF
parser. The setting is exactly the same as that de-
scribed in (Saleh et al., 2014).
Evaluation measure. In all experiments, we used
the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F
1
)
(van Rijsbergen, 1979), computed at the token
level and micro-averaged across the different se-
mantic types.

we did not include it in the F

calculation.

Brown Clusters. Clustering groups of similar
words together provides a way of generalizing
them. In this work, we explore the use of Brown
clusters (Brown et al., 1992) in both feature vec-
tors and tree kernels. The Brown clustering al-
gorithm uses an n-gram class model. It first as-
signs each word to a distinct cluster, and then it
merges different clusters in a bottom-up fashion.
The merge step is done in a way that minimizes the
loss in average mutual information between clus-
ters. The outcome is hierarchical clustering, which
we use in our reranking algorithm. To create the
Brown clusters, we used the Yelp dataset of re-
views.
7
It contains 335,022 reviews about 15,585
businesses; 5,575 of the businesses and 233,839 of
the reviews are restaurant-related. This dataset is
very similar to the dataset of queries about restau-
rants we use in our experiments.
Similarity matrix for SK. We compute the lexi-
cal similarity for SK by applying LSA (Furnas et
al., 1988) to Tripadvisor data. The dataset and the
exact procedure for creating the LSA matrix are
described in (Castellucci et al., 2013; Croce and
Previtali, 2010).
4.2 Results
Oracle accuracy. Table 2 shows the oracle F
1
score for N -best lists of different lengths, i.e., the
F
1
that is achieved by picking the best candidate
in the N -best list for various values of N . Con-
sidering 5-best lists yields an increase in oracle F
1
of almost ten absolute points. Going up to 10-best
lists only adds 2.5 extra F
1
points. The complete
100-best lists add 3.5 extra F
1
points, for a total
of 98.72. This very high value is explained by the
fact that often the total number of different anno-
tations for a given question is smaller than 100. In
our experiments, we will focus on 5-best lists.
Baseline accuracy. We computed F
1
for the semi-
CRF model on both the development and the test
sets, obtaining 83.86 and 83.03, respectively.
Learning Curves. The semantic information in
terms of BCs or semantic similarity derived by
LSA can have a major impact in case of data
scarcity. Therefore, we trained our reranking mod-
els with increasing sizes of training data.

Figure 2: Learning curves for different reranking models on the development and on the testing sets.
The first two graphs in Fig. 2 show the plots
on the development set whereas the last two are
computed on the test set. The reranking models
reported are Baseline, PTK, PTK+BC, PTK+all
(features), PTK+BC+all, SK, SK+BC, SK+all and
SK+BC+all.
8
We can see that: (i) PTK alone, i.e.,
without semantic information, has the lowest ac-
curacy; (ii) BCs do not improve significantly any
model; (iii) SK almost always achieves the high-
est accuracy; (iv) PTK+all (i.e., the model also us-
ing features) improves on PTK, but its accuracy
is lower than for any model using SK, i.e., us-
ing semantic similarity; and (v) all features pro-
vide an initial boost to SK, but as soon as the data
increases, their impact decreases.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In summary, the learning curves clearly show the
good generalization ability of SK, which improve
the CRF baseline using little data (?3,000). The
semantic kernel significantly improves over the
semi-CRF baseline and our previous state-of-the-
art reranker exploiting shallow syntactic patterns
(Saleh et al., 2014), which corresponds to PTK+all
in the above comparison.
8
Models are split between 2 plots in order to ease reading.
The improvement falls between 1-2 absolute
percent points. This is remarkable as (i) it corre-
sponds to ?10% relative error reduction, and (ii)
the state-of-the-art baseline system is very difficult
to beat, as confirmed by the low impact of tradi-
tional features and BCs. Although the latter can
generalize over concepts and words, their use is
not straightforward, resulting in no improvement.
In the future, we plan to investigate the use of
semantic similarity from distributional and other
sources (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Pad´o and Lapata,
2007), e.g., Wikipedia (Strube and Ponzetto, 2006;
Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007), Wiktionary (Zesch
et al., 2008), WordNet (Pedersen et al., 2004;
Agirre et al., 2009), FrameNet, VerbNet (Shi and
Mihalcea, 2005), BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2010), and LSA, and for different domains.
