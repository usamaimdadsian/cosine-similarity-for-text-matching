Abstract
Many machine translation evaluation met-
rics have been proposed after the seminal
BLEU metric, and many among them have
been found to consistently outperform BLEU,
demonstrated by their better correlations with
human judgment. It has long been the hope
that by tuning machine translation systems
against these new generation metrics, ad-
vances in automatic machine translation eval-
uation can lead directly to advances in auto-
matic machine translation. However, to date
there has been no unambiguous report that
these new metrics can improve a state-of-the-
art machine translation system over its BLEU-
tuned baseline.
In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning
Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical
machine translation system, with the TESLA
metrics results in significantly better human-
judged translation quality than the BLEU-
tuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is
simple and performs well in practice on large
datasets. We release all our implementation
under an open source license. It is our hope
that this work will encourage the machine
translation community to finally move away
from BLEU as the unquestioned default and
to consider the new generation metrics when
tuning their systems.
1 Introduction
The dominant framework of machine translation
(MT) today is statistical machine translation (SMT)
(Hutchins, 2007). At the core of the system is the
decoder, which performs the actual translation. The
decoder is parameterized, and estimating the optimal
set of parameter values is of paramount importance
in getting good translations. In SMT, the parame-
ter space is explored by a tuning algorithm, typically
MERT (Minimum Error Rate Training) (Och, 2003),
though the exact method is not important for our
purpose. The tuning algorithm carries out repeated
experiments with different decoder parameter val-
ues over a development data set, for which reference
translations are given. An automatic MT evaluation
metric compares the output of the decoder against
the reference(s), and guides the tuning algorithm to-
wards iteratively better decoder parameters and out-
put translations. The quality of the automatic MT
evaluation metric therefore has an immediate effect
on the whole system.
The first automatic MT evaluation metric to show
a high correlation with human judgment is BLEU
(Papineni et al., 2002). Together with its close vari-
ant the NIST metric, they have quickly become the
standard way of tuning statistical machine transla-
tion systems. While BLEU is an impressively sim-
ple and effective metric, recent evaluations have
shown that many new generation metrics can out-
perform BLEU in terms of correlation with human
judgment (Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-
Burch et al., 2010). Some of these new metrics in-
clude METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Lavie
and Agarwal, 2007), TER (Snover et al., 2006),
MAXSIM (Chan and Ng, 2008; Chan and Ng,
2009), and TESLA (Liu et al., 2010).
Given the close relationship between automatic
MT and automatic MT evaluation, the logical expec-
tation is that a better MT evaluation metric would
375
lead to better MT systems. However, this linkage
has not yet been realized. In the SMT community,
MT tuning still uses BLEU almost exclusively.
Some researchers have investigated the use of bet-
ter metrics for MT tuning, with mixed results. Most
notably, Pado´ et al. (2009) reported improved human
judgment using their entailment-based metric. How-
ever, the metric is heavy weight and slow in practice,
with an estimated runtime of 40 days on the NIST
MT 2002/2006/2008 dataset, and the authors had to
resort to a two-phase MERT process with a reduced
n-best list. As we shall see, our experiments use the
similarly sized WMT 2010 dataset, and most of our
runs take less than one day.
Cer et al. (2010) compared tuning a phrase-based
SMT system with BLEU, NIST, METEOR, and
TER, and concluded that BLEU and NIST are still
the best choices for MT tuning, despite the proven
higher correlation of METEOR and TER with hu-
man judgment.
In this work, we investigate the effect of MERT
using BLEU, TER, and two variants of TESLA,
TESLA-M and TESLA-F, on Joshua (Li et al.,
2009), a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based
SMT system (Chiang, 2005; Chiang, 2007). Our
empirical study is carried out in the context of WMT
2010, for the French-English, Spanish-English, and
German-English machine translation tasks. We
show that Joshua responds well to the change of
evaluation metric, in that a system trained on met-
ric M typically does well when judged by the same
metric M. We further evaluate the different systems
with manual judgments and show that the TESLA
family of metrics (both TESLA-M and TESLA-F)
significantly outperforms BLEU when used to guide
the MERT search.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we describe the four evaluation metrics
used. Section 3 outlines our experimental set up us-
ing the WMT 2010 machine translation tasks. Sec-
tion 4 presents the evaluation results, both automatic
and manual. Finally, we discuss our findings in Sec-
tion 5, future work in Section 6, and conclude in
Section 7.
2 Evaluation metrics
This section describes the metrics used in our exper-
iments. We do not seek to explain all their variants
and intricate details, but rather to outline their core
characteristics and to highlight their similarities and
differences. In particular, since all our experiments
are based on single references, we omit the com-
plications due to multiple references and refer our
readers instead to the respective original papers for
the details.
2.1 BLEU
BLEU is fundamentally based on n-gram match pre-
cisions. Given a reference text R and a translation
candidate T , we generate the bag of all n-grams con-
tained inR and T for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and denote them
as BNGnR and BNGnT respectively. The n-gram pre-
cision is thus defined as
Pn =
|BNGnR ? BNGnT|
|BNGnT|
To compensate for the lack of the recall measure,
and hence the tendency to produce short translations,
BLEU introduces a brevity penalty, defined as
BP =
{
1 if|T| > |R|
e1?|R|/|T | if|T| ? |R|
where the | · | operator denotes the size of a bag or
the number of words in a text. The metric is finally
defined as
BLEU(R,T) = BP× 4
?
P1P2P3P4
BLEU is a very simple metric requiring neither
training nor language-specific resources. Its use of
the brevity penalty is however questionable, as sub-
sequent research on n-gram-based metrics has con-
sistently found that recall is in fact a more potent
indicator than precision (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005;
Zhou et al., 2006; Chan and Ng, 2009). As we
shall see, despite the BP term, BLEU still exhibits
a strong tendency to produce short translations.
2.2 TER
TER is based on counting transformations rather
than n-gram matches. The metric is defined as the
376
minimum number of edits needed to change a can-
didate translation T to the reference R, normalized
by the length of the reference, i.e.,
TER(R,T) = number of edits|R|
One edit is defined as one insertion, deletion, or
substitution of a single word, or the shift of a con-
tiguous sequence of words, regardless of size and
distance. Minimizing the edit distance so defined
has been shown to be NP-complete, so the evalua-
tion is carried out in practice by a heuristic greedy
search algorithm.
TER is a strong contender as the leading new gen-
eration automatic metric and has been used in major
evaluation campaigns such as GALE. Like BLEU,
it is simple and requires no language specific re-
sources. TER also corresponds well to the human
intuition of an evaluation metric.
2.3 TESLA-M
TESLA1 is a family of linear programming-based
metrics proposed by Liu et al. (2010) that incor-
porates many newer ideas. The simplest varia-
tion is TESLA-M2, based on matching bags of n-
grams (BNG) like BLEU. However, unlike BLEU,
TESLA-M formulates the matching process as a
real-valued linear programming problem, thereby
allowing the use of weights. An example weighted
BNG matching problem is shown in Figure 1.
Two kinds of weights are used in TESLA-M.
First, the metric emphasizes the content words by
discounting the weight of an n-gram by 0.1 for ev-
ery function word it contains. Second, the similarity
between two n-grams is a function dependent on the
lemmas, the WordNet synsets (Fellbaum, 1998), and
the POS tag of every word in the n-grams.
Each node in Figure 1 represents one weighted n-
gram. The four in the top row represent one BNG,
and the three at the bottom represent the other BNG.
The goal of the linear programming problem is to
assign weights to the links between the two BNGs,
so as to maximize the sum of the products of the link
weights and their corresponding similarity scores.

(b) The solution
Figure 1: Matching two weighted bags of n-grams.
w denotes the weight and s denotes the similarity.
The constraints of the linear programming prob-
lem are: (1) all assigned weights must be non-
negative, and (2) the sum of weights assigned to all
links connecting a node cannot exceed the node’s
weight. Intuitively, we allow splitting n-grams into
fractional counts, and match them giving priority to
the pairs with the highest similarities.
The linear programming formulation ensures that
the matching can be solved uniquely and efficiently.
Once the solution is found and let the maximized
objective function value be S, the precision is com-
puted as S over the sum of weights of the translation
candidate n-grams. Similarly, the recall is S over the
sum of weights of the reference n-grams. The pre-
cision and the recall are then combined to form the
F-0.8 measure:
Fn =
Precision× Recall
0.8× Precision + 0.2× Recall
This F-measure gives more importance to the re-
call, reflecting its closer correlation with human
judgment. Fn for n = 1, 2, 3 are calculated and av-
eraged to produce the final score.
TESLA-M gains an edge over the previous two
metrics by the use of lightweight linguistic features
such as lemmas, synonym dictionaries, and POS

tags. While such tools are usually available even for
languages other than English, it does make TESLA-
M more troublesome to port to non-English lan-
guages.
TESLA-M did well in the WMT 2010 evaluation
campaign. According to the system-level correla-
tion with human judgments (Tables 1 and 2), it ranks
top for the out-of-English task and very close to the
top for the into-English task (Callison-Burch et al.,
2010).
2.4 TESLA-F3
TESLA-F builds on top of TESLA-M. While word-
level synonyms are handled in TESLA-M by exam-
ining WordNet synsets, no modeling of phrase-level
synonyms is possible. TESLA-F attempts to rem-
edy this shortcoming by exploiting a phrase table
between the target language and another language,
known as the pivot language.
Assume the target language is English and the
pivot language is French, i.e., we are provided with
an English-French phrase table. Let R and T be the

2010). To minimize confusion, in this work we call the metric
TESLA-F and refer to the whole family of metrics as TESLA.

reference and the translation candidate respectively,
both in English. As an example,
R: Good morning , sir .
T: Hello , Querrien .
TESLA-F first segments both R and T into
phrases to maximize the probability of the sen-
tences. For example, suppose both Good morning ,
sir . and Hello , can be found in the English-French
phrase table, and proper name Querrien is out-of-
vocabulary, then a likely segmentation is:
R: ||| Good morning , sir . |||
T: ||| Hello , ||| Querrien ||| . |||
Each English phrase is then mapped to a bag
of weighted French phrases using the phrase table,
transforming the English sentences into confusion
networks resembling Figures 2 and 3. French n-
grams are extracted from these confusion network
representations, known as pivot language n-grams.
The bag of pivot language n-grams generated by R
is then matched against that generated by T with
the same linear programming formulation used in
TESLA-M.
TESLA-F incorporates all the F-measures used in
TESLA-M, with the addition of (1) the F-measures
generated over the pivot language n-grams described
above, and (2) the normalized language model score,
defined as 1n logP , where n is the length of thetranslation, and P the language model probability.
Unlike BLEU and TESLA-M which rely on simple
averages (geometric and arithmetic average respec-
tively) to combine the component scores, TESLA-
378
F trains the weights over a set of human judg-
ments using a linear ranking support vector machine
(RSVM). This allows TESLA-F to exploit its com-
ponents more effectively, but also makes it more te-
dious to work with and introduces potential domain
mismatch problems.
TESLA-F makes use of even more linguistic in-
formation than TESLA-M, and has the capability
of recognizing some forms of phrase synonyms.
TESLA-F ranked top for the into-English evalua-
tion task in WMT 2010 (Table 1). However, the
added complexity, in particular the use of the lan-
guage model score and the tuning of the component
weights appear to make it less stable than TESLA-M
in practice. For example, it did not perform as well
in the out-of-English task.
3 Experimental setup
We run our experiments in the setting of the WMT
2010 news commentary machine translation cam-
paign, for three language pairs:
1. French-English (fr-en): the training text con-
sists of 84624 sentences of French-English bi-
text. The average French sentence length is 25
words.
2. Spanish-English (es-en): the training text con-
sists of 98598 sentences of Spanish-English bi-
text. The average Spanish sentence length is 25
words.
3. German-English (de-en): the training text con-
sists of 100269 sentences of German-English
bitext. The average German sentence length is
22 words.
The average English sentence length is 21 words
for all three language pairs. The text domain is
newswire report, and the English sides of the train-
ing texts for the three language pairs overlap sub-
stantially. The development data are 2525 four-way
translated sentences, in English, French, Spanish,
and German respectively. Similarly, the test data
are 2489 four-way translated sentences. As a conse-
quence, all MT evaluations involve only single ref-
erences.
We follow the standard approach for training hi-
erarchical phrase-based SMT systems. First, we to-
kenize and lowercase the training texts and create

word alignments using the Berkeley aligner (Liang
et al., 2006; Haghighi et al., 2009) with five iter-
ations of training. Then, we create suffix arrays
and extract translation grammars for the develop-
ment and test set with Joshua in its default setting.
The maximum phrase length is 10. For the language
model, we use SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) to build a
trigram model with modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing from the monolingual training data supplied in
WMT 2010.
Parameter tuning is carried out using Z-
MERT (Zaidan, 2009). TER and BLEU are al-
ready implemented in the publicly released version
of Z-MERT, and Z-MERT’s modular design makes
it easy to integrate TESLA-M and TESLA-F into the
package. The maximum number of MERT iterations
is set to 100, although we observe that in practice,
the algorithm converges after 3 to 6 iterations. The
number of intermediate initial points per iteration is
set to 20 and the n-best list is capped to 300 trans-
lations. Table 3 shows the training times and the
number of MERT iterations for each of the language
pairs and evaluation metrics.
We use the publicly available version of TESLA-
F, which comes with phrase tables and a ranking
SVM model trained on the WMT 2010 development
data.

The results of the automatic evaluations are pre-
sented in Table 4. The best score according to each
metric is shown in bold. Note that smaller TER
scores are better, as are larger BLEU, TESLA-M,
and TESLA-F scores.4
We note that Joshua generally responds well to

ric M usually does the best or very close to the best
when evaluated by M. On the other hand, the dif-
ferences between different systems can be substan-
tial, especially between BLEU/TER and TESLA-
M/TESLA-F.
In addition to the automatic evaluation, we en-
listed twelve judges to manually evaluate the first
200 test sentences. Four judges are assigned to
each of the three language pairs. For each test sen-
tence, the judges are presented with the source sen-
tence, the reference English translation, and the out-
put from the four competing Joshua systems. The
order of the translation candidates is randomized so
that the judges will not see any patterns. The judges
are instructed to rank the four candidates, and ties
are allowed.
The inter-annotator agreement is reported in Ta-
ble 5. We consider the judgment for a pair of system
outputs as one data point. Let P (A) be the propor-
tion of times that the annotators agree, and P (E)

Table 6: Percentage of times each system produces

be the proportion of times that they would agree by
chance. The Kappa coefficient is defined as
Kappa = P(A)? P(E)1? P(E)
In our experiments, each data point has three pos-
sible values: A is preferred, B is preferred, and no
preference, hence P (E) = 1/3. Our Kappa is cal-
culated in the same way as the WMT workshops
(Callison-Burch et al., 2009; Callison-Burch et al.,
2010).
Kappa coefficients between 0.4 and 0.6 are con-
sidered moderate, and our values are in line with
those reported in the WMT 2010 translation cam-
paign. The exception is the German-English pair,
where the annotators only reach slight agreement.
This might be caused by the lower quality of Ger-
man to English translations compared to the other
two language pairs.
Table 6 shows the proportion of times each sys-
tem produces the best translation among the four.
We observe that the rankings are largely consis-
tent across different language pairs: Both TESLA-
F and TESLA-M strongly outperform BLEU and
TER. Note that the values in each column do not
add up to 100%, since the candidate translations are
often identical, and even a different translation can
receive the same human judgment.
Table 7 shows our main result, the pairwise com-
parison between the four systems for each of the lan-
guage pairs. Again the rankings consistently show
that both TESLA-F and TESLA-M strongly out-
perform BLEU and TER. All differences are sta-
tistically significant under the Sign Test at p =
0.01, with the exception of TESLA-M vs TESLA-
F in the French-English task, BLEU vs TER in the
Spanish-English task, and TESLA-M vs TESLA-F
and BLEU vs TER in the German-English task. The
results provide strong evidence that tuning machine

to significantly better translation output.
5 Discussion
We examined the results manually, and found that
the relationship between the types of mistakes each
system makes and the characteristics of the corre-
sponding metric to be intricate. We discuss our find-
ings in this section.
First we observe that BLEU and TER tend to pro-
duce very similar translations, and so do TESLA-
F and TESLA-M. Of the 2489 test sentences in the
French-English task, BLEU and TER produced dif-
ferent translations for only 760 sentences, or 31%.
Similarly, TESLA-F and TESLA-M gave different
outputs for only 857 sentences, or 34%. In contrast,
BLEU and TESLA-M gave different translations for
2248 sentences, or 90%. It is interesting to find that
BLEU and TER should be so similar, considering
that they are based on very different principles. As a
metric, TESLA-M is certainly much more similar to
BLEU than TER is, yet they behave very differently
when used as a tuning metric.
We also observe that TESLA-F and TESLA-M
tend to produce much longer sentences than do
BLEU and TER. The average sentence lengths of the
TESLA-F- and TESLA-M-tuned systems across all
three language pairs are 26.5 and 26.6 words respec-
tively, whereas those for BLEU and TER are only
22.4 and 21.7 words. Comparing the translations
from the two groups, the tendency of BLEU and
TER to pick shorter paraphrases and to drop func-
tion words is unmistakable, often to the detriment of
the translation quality. Some typical examples from
the French-English task are shown in Figure 4.
Interestingly, the human translations average only
22 words, so BLEU and TER translations are in fact
much closer on average to the reference lengths, yet
their translations often feel too short. In contrast,
manual inspections reveal no tendency for TESLA-F
and TESLA-M to produce overly long translations.
These observations suggest that the brevity
penalty of BLEU is not aggressive enough. Nei-
ther is TER, which penalizes insertions and dele-
tions equally. Interestingly, by placing much more
emphasis on the recall, TESLA-M and TESLA-F
produce translations that are statistically too long,
but feel much more ‘correct’ lengthwise.
Another major difference between TESLA-
M/TESLA-F and BLEU/TER is that the TESLAs
heavily discount n-grams with function words. One
might thus expect the TESLA-tuned systems to be
less adept at function words; yet they translate them
surprisingly well, as shown in Figure 4. One ex-
planation is of course the sentence length effect we
have discussed. Another reason may be that since
the metric does not care much about function words,
the language model is given more freedom to pick
function words as it sees fit, without the fear of large
penalties. Paradoxically, by reducing the weights
of function words, we end up making better trans-
lations for them.
TER is the only metric that allows cheap block
movements, regardless of size or distance. One
might reasonably speculate that a TER-tuned system
should be more prone to reordering phrases. How-
ever, we find no evidence that this is so.
The relative performance of TESLA-M vs
TESLA-F is unsurprising. TESLA-F, being heav-
ier and slower, produces somewhat better results
than its minimalist counterpart, though the margin
is far less pronounced than that between TESLA-
M and the conventional BLEU and TER. Since ex-
tra resources including bitexts are needed in using
TESLA-F, TESLA-M emerges as the MT evaluation
metric of choice for tuning SMT systems.
6 Future work
We have presented empirical evidence that the
TESLA metrics outperform BLEU for MT tuning
in a hierarchical phrase-based SMT system. At
the same time, some open questions remain unan-
swered. We intend to investigate them in our future
work.
The work of (Cer et al., 2010) investigated the ef-
fect of tuning a phrase-based SMT system and found
that of the MT evaluation metrics that they tried,
none of them could outperform BLEU. We would
like to verify whether TESLA tuning is still pre-
ferred over BLEU tuning in a phrase-based SMT
system.
Based on our observations, it may be possible to
improve the performance of BLEU-based tuning by
(1) increasing the brevity penalty; (2) introducing

the ideal case, such a modified BLEU metric would
deliver results similar to that of TESLA-M, yet with
a runtime cost closer to BLEU. It would also make
porting existing tuning code easier.
7 Conclusion
We demonstrate for the first time that a practical
new generation MT evaluation metric can signifi-
cantly improve the quality of automatic MT com-
pared to BLEU, as measured by human judgment.
We hope this work will encourage the MT research
community to finally move away from BLEU and to
consider tuning their systems with a new generation
metric.
