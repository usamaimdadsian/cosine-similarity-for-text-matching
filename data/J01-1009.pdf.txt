With the explosion in the quantity of on- 
line information in recent years, automatic 
abstracting and indexing has received re- 
newed interest and a number of promising 
approaches have emerged. The goal of this 
book is to present a complete description of 
current indexing and abstracting techniques 
in the context of the underlying linguistic 
and statistical knowledge. 
The book has three parts: the indexing and 
abstracting environment, methods of auto- 
matic indexing and abstracting, and appli- 
cations. The first part covers theories about 
text, such as rhetorical and thematic struc- 
ture, and discusses the use of different ext 
representations for information retrieval and 
abstraction. The second part of the book 
deals with lexical analysis and weighting 
schemes, abstraction, and evaluation tech- 
niques. The third part describes two sum- 
marization systems developed by the author: 
a summarizer for court cases and a generic 
magazine article summarizer. 
I found the application part particularly in- 
teresting because it describes all the stages 
of the development of applied summariza- 
tion systems, from the initial corpus analysis 
to the final evaluation of the method. The 
system developed by the author combines 
symbolic techniques, uch as a text grammar, 
with statistical methods, such as classifica- 
tion and clustering. The system demonstrates 
tradeoffs between symbolic techniques based 
on manual knowledge ncoding and corpus- 
based shallow methods. 
However, the book's breadth comes at the 
expense of its depth. This problem is espe- 
cially acute in the first two parts of the book, 
which are supposed to give an overview 
of the subject. The presentation of text the- 
ories and abstraction techniques is some- 
what superficial and incomplete; the book 
is not up to date and does not contain the 
latest developments in the area. For exam- 
ple, it omits computational methods for dis- 
course; cohesion-based approaches; egmen- 
tation algorithms; and recent work in eval- 
uation, corpus-based summarization, and re- 
generation (e.g, Marcu 1997; Mani et al. 1998; 
Jing and McKeown 1999). These limitations 
can be a major hurdle for the reader who 
wants to learn about state-of-the-art devel- 
opments.--Regina B rzilay, Columbia Univer-
