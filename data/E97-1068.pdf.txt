This paper proposes a two-layered model 
of dialogue structure for task-oriented i- 
alogues that processes contextual informa- 
tion and disambiguates speech acts. The 
final goal is to improve translation quality 
in a speech-to-speech translation system. 
1 Ambigu i ty  in Speech  Trans la t ion  
For any given utterance out of what we can loosely 
call context, there is usually more than one possible 
interpretation. A speaker's utterance of an ellipti- 
cal expression, like the figure "'twelve fifteen", might 
have a different meaning depending on the context of 
situation, the way the conversation has evolved un- 
til that point, and the previous peaker's utterance. 
"Twelve fifteen" could be the time "a quarter after 
twelve", the price "one thousand two hundred and 
fifteen", the room number "'one two one five", and so 
on. Although English can conflate all those possible 
meanings into one expression, the translation into 
other languages usually requires more specificity. 
If this is a problem for any human listener, the 
problem grows considerably when it is a parser do- 
ing the disambiguation. In this paper, I explain how 
we can use discourse knowledge in order to help a 
parser disambiguate among different possible parses 
for an input sentence, with the final goal of improv- 
ing the translation in an end-to-end speech transla- 
tion system. 
The work described was conducted within the 
JANUS multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation 
system designed to  translate spontaneous dialogue 
in a limited domain (Lavie et al.. 1996). The 
machine translation component of JANUS handles 
these problems using two different approaches: the 
Generalized Left-to-Right parser GLR* (Lavie and 
Tomita, 1993) and Phoenix. the latter being the fo- 
cus of this paper.

2 D isambiguat ion  through 
Contextua l  In fo rmat ion  
This project addresses the problem of choosing the 
most appropriate semantic parse for any given in- 
put. The approach is to combine discourse informa- 
tion with the set of possible parses provided by the 
Phoenix parser for an input string. The discourse 
module selects one of these possibilities. The deci- 
sion is to be based on: 
1. The domain of the dialogue. JANUS deals 
with dialogues restricted to a domain, such as 
scheduling an appointment or making travel ar- 
rangements. The general topic provides some 
information about what types of exchanges, and 
therefore speech acts, can be expected. 
2. The macro-structure of the dialogue up to that 
point. We can divide a dialogue into smaller, 
self-contained units that provide information on 
what phases are over or yet to be covered: Are 
we past the greeting phase? If a flight was re- 
served, should we expect a payment phase at 
some point in the rest of the conversation'? 
3. The structure of adjacency pairs (Schegloff and 
Sacks, 1973), together with the responses to 
speech functions (Halliday, 1994: Martin. 1992). 
If one speaker has uttered a request for infor- 
mation, we expect some sort of response to that 
- -  an answer, a disclaimer or a clarification. 
The domain of the dialogues, named travel plan- 
nin 9 domain, consists of dialogues where a customer 
makes travel arrangements with a travel agent or 
a hotel clerk to book hotel rooms, flights or other 
forms of transportation. They are task-oriented i- 
alogues, in which the speakers have specific goals of 
carrying out a task that involves the exchange of 
both intbrmation and services. 
Discourse processing is structured in two different 
levels: the context module keeps a global history of 
the conversation, from which it will be able to esti- 
mate, for instance, the likelihood of a greeting once 
the opening phase of the conversation is over. A 
more local history predicts the expected response in 
510 
any adjacency pair. such as a question-answer se- 
quence. The model adopted here is that of a two- 
layered finite state machine (henceforth FSM). and 
the approach is that of late-stage di.sarnbzguatlon. 
where as muci~ information as possible is collected 
before proceeding on to disambiguation, rather than 
restricting the parser's earch earlier on. 
3 Representat ion  o f  Speech  Acts  in  
Phoen ix  
Writing tile appropriate grammars and deciding on 
the set of speech acts for this domain is also an im- 
portant part of this project. The selected speech 
acts are encoded in the grammar - -  in the Phoeni× 
case. a semantic grammar - -  the tokens of whici~ 
are concepts thac the segment in question represents. 
Any utterance is divided into SDUs - -  Semantic Di- 
alogue Units - -  which are fed to the parser one at a 
time. SDUs represent a full concept, expression, or 
thought, but not necessarily a complete grammat i -  
cal sentence. Let us take an example input, and a 
possible parse for it: 
(1) Could you tell me the prices at the Hol iday Inn? 
,\[request\] (COULD YOU 
;\[reques¢-mfo} (TELL ME 
,'\[price-into\] (THE PRICES 
(\[establishment\] (AT THE 
, \[estabhshmenc-name\] (HOLIDAY INN)))))))))) 
The top-level concepts of the grammar are speech 
acts themselves, the ones immediately after are fur- 
ther refinements of the speech act, and the lower 
level concepts capture the specifics of the utterance. 
such as the name of the hotel in the above example. 
4 The  D iscourse  Processor  
The discourse module processes the global and lo- 
cal structure of the dialogue in two different lay- 
ers. The first one is a general organization of 
tile dialogue's ubparts: the layer under that pro- 
,:esses the possible sequence of speech acts in a 
subpart.  The assumption is that negotiation di- 
alogues develop m a predictable way - -  this as- 
sumption was also made for scheduling dialogues in 
tile Verbmobil project (Maier, I096) - - .  with three 
,'lear phases: mlttalizatwn, negotiation, and dos- 
rag. \Ve will call the middle phase in our dialogues 
the task performance phase, since it is not always 
a negotiation per se. Within the task performance 
phase very many subdialogues can take place, such 
as intbrmation-seeking, decision-making, payment.  
clarification, etc. 
Disco trse processing has frequently made use of 
~equeuces of speech acts as they occur in the dia- 
logue, through bigram probabil it ies of occurrences. 
or through modell ing in a finite state machine. 
(31aier. 1.996: Reithinger e ta \ [ . ,  t9.96: Iida and Ya- 
maoka. 1990: Qu et al.. 1996). However. taking into 
account only the speech act of the previous egment

might leave us with insufficient information to decide 
- -  as is the case in some elliptical utterances which 
do not follow a strict adjacency pair sequence: 
(2) (talking about flight times...} 
S1 \[ can .give you the arrival time. Do you 
have that information already'? 
S2 No. \[ don't. 
$1 It's twelve fifteen. 
If we are in parsing tile segment "'It's twelve fif- 
teen", and our only source of information is the pre- 
vious segment. "'No. \[ don ' t ' ,  we cannot possibly 
find tile referent for "'twelve fifteen", unless we know 
we are in a subdialogue discussing flight times, and 
arrival times have been previously mentioned. 
Our approach aims at obtaining information both 
from the subdialogue structure and the speech act 
sequence by modell ing the global structure of tile di- 
alogue with a FSM. with opening and c los ing  as 
initial and final states, and other possible subdia- 
logues in the intervening states. Each one of those 
states contains a FSAI itself, which determines the 
allowed speech acts in a given subdialogue and their 
sequence. For a picture of the discourse component 
here proposed, see Figure I. 
Let us look at another example where the use 
of information on the previous context and on tile 
speaker aIternance will help choose the most appro- 
priate parse and thus achieve a better translation. 
511 
The expression "okay" can be a prompt for an an- 
swer (3), an acceptance of a previous offer (4) or 
a backchanneling element, i.e., an acknowledgement 
that the previous speaker's utterance has been un- 
derstood (5). 
(3) $1 So we'll switch you to a double room. okay? 
(4) S1 So we'll switch you to a double room. 
$2 Okay. 
(5) S1 The double room is $90 a night. 
$2 Okay, and how much is a single room? 
In example (3), we will know that "okay" is a 
prompt, because it is uttered by the speaker after 
he or she has made a suggestion. In example (4), it 
will be an acceptance because it is uttered after the 
previous speaker's uggestion. And in (5) it is an 
acknowledgment of the information provided. The 
correct assignment ofspeech acts will provide a more 
accurate translation into other languages. 
To summarize, the two-layered FSM models a con- 
versation through transitions of speech acts that are 
included in subdialogues. When the parser returns 
an ambiguity in the form of two or more possible 
speech acts, the FSM will help decide which one is 
the most appropriate given the context. 
There are situations where the path followed in 
the two layers of the structure does not match the 
parse possibility we are trying to accept or reject. 
One such situation is the presence of clarification 
and correction subdialogues at any point in the con- 
versation. In that case, the processor will try to 
jump to the upper layer, in order to switch the sub- 
dialogue under consideration. We also take into ac- 
count the situation where there is no possible choice, 
either because the FSM does not restrict the choice 
i.e., the FSM allows all the parses returned by 
the parser - -  or because the model does not allow 
any of them. In either of those cases, the transition 
is determined by unigram probabilities of the speech 
act in isolation, and bigrams of the combination of 
the speech act we are trying to disambiguate plus its 
predecessor. 
5 Eva luat ion  
The discourse module is being developed on a set of 
29 dialogues, totalling 1,393 utterances. An evalu- 
ation will be performed on 10 dialogues, previously 
unseen by the discourse module. Since the mod- 
ule can be either incorporated into the system, or 
turned off, the evaluation will be on the system's 
performance with and without the discourse module,

of the translation 1. A secondary evaluation will be

based on the quality of the speech act disambigua- 
tion itself, regardless of its contribution to transla- 
tion quality. 
6 Conc lus ion  and  Future  Work  
In this paper I have presented a model of dialogue 
structure in two layers, which processes the sequence 
of subdialogues and speech acts in task-oriented 
dialogues in order to select the most appropriate 
from the ambiguous parses returned by the Phoenix 
parser. The model structures dialogue in two lev- 
els of finite state machines, with the final goal of 
improving translation quality. 
A possible extension to the work here described 
would be to generalize the two-layer model to other. 
less homogeneous domains. The use of statistical 
information in different parts of the processing, such 
as the arcs of the FSM, could enhance performance.
