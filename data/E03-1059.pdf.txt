Abstract
We describe experiments with a Naive
Bayes text classifier in the context of
anti- spam E-mail filtering, using two
different statistical event models: a mul-
ti-variate Bernoulli model and a multi-
nomial model. We introduce a family of
feature ranking functions for feature se-
lection in the multinomial event model
that take account of the word frequency
information. We present evaluation re-
sults on two publicly available corpora
of legitimate and spam E-mails. We find
that the multinomial model is less biased
towards one class and achieves slightly
higher accuracy than the multi-variate
Bernoulli model.
1 Introduction
Text categorization is the task of assigning a text
document to one of several predefined categories.
Text categorization plays an important role in nat-
ural language processing (NLP) and information
retrieval (IR) applications. One particular applica-
tion of text categorization is anti-spam E-mail fil-
tering, where the goal is to block unsolicited mes-
sages with commercial or pornographic content
(UCE, spam) from a user's E-mail stream, while
letting other (legitimate) messages pass. Here, the
task is to assign a message to one of two cate-
gories, legitimate and spam, based on the mes-
sage's content.
In recent years, a growing body of research has
applied machine learning techniques to text cat-
egorization and (anti-spam) E-mail filtering, in-
cluding rule learning (Cohen, 1996), Naive Bayes
(Sahami et al., 1998; Androutsopoulos et al.,
2000b; Rennie, 2000), memory based learning
(Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b), decision trees
(Carreras and Marquez, 2001), support vector ma-
chines (Drucker et al., 1999) or combinations of
different learners (Sakkis et al., 2001). In these ap-
proaches a classifier is learned from training data
rather than constructed by hand, which results in
better and more robust classifiers.
The Naive Bayes classifier has been found par-
ticularly attractive for the task of text categoriza-
tion because it performs surprisingly well in many
application areas despite its simplicity (Lewis,
1998). Bayesian classifiers are based on a prob-
abilistic model of text generation. A text is gener-
ated by first choosing a class according to some
prior probability and then generating a text ac-
cording to a class-specific distribution. The model
parameters are estimated from training examples
that have been annotated with their correct class.
Given a new document, the classifier outputs the
class which is most likely to have generated the
document.
From a linguistic point of view, a document is
made up of words, and the semantics of the doc-
ument is determined by the meaning of the words
and the linguistic structure of the document. The
Naive Bayesian classifier makes the simplifying
assumption that the probability that a document is
generated in some class depends only on the prob-
abilities of the words given the context of the class,
and that the words in a document are independent
of each other. This is called the Naive Bayes as-
sumption.
The generative model underlying the Naive
Bayes classifier can be characterized with respect
to the amount of information it captures about the
307
words in a document. In information retrieval and
text categorization, two types of models have been
used (McCallum and Nigam, 1998). Both assume
that there is a fixed vocabulary. In the first model,
a document is generated by first choosing a sub-
set of the vocabulary and then using the selected
words any number of times, at least once, in any
order. This model is called multi-variate Bernoulli
model. It captures the information of which words
are used in a document, but not the number of
times each words is used, nor the order of the
words in the document.
In the second model, a document is generated
by choosing a set of word occurrences and arrang-
ing them in any order. This model is called multi-
nomial model. In addition to the multi-variate
Bernoulli model, it also captures the information
about how many times a word is used in a docu-
ment. Note that in both models, a document can
contain additional words that are not in the vocab-
ulary, which are considered noise and are not used
for classification.
Despite the fact that the multi-variate Bernoulli
model captures less information about a document
(compared to the multinomial model), it performs
quite well in text categorization tasks, particu-
larly when the set of words used for classification
is small. However, McCallum and Nigam (1998)
have shown that the multinomial model outper-
forms the multi-variate Bernoulli model on larger
vocabulary sizes or when the vocabulary size is
chosen optimal for both models.
Most text categorization approaches to anti-
spam E-mail filtering have used the multi-variate
Bernoulli model (Androutsopoulos et al., 2000b).
Rennie (2000) used a multinomial model but
did not compare it to the multi-variate model.
Mladenia and Grobelnik (1999) used a multino-
mial model in a different context. In this paper we
present results of experiments in which we evalu-
ated the performance of a Naive Bayes classifier
on two publicly available E-mail corpora, using
both the multi-variate Bernoulli and the multino-
mial model.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2
we describe the Naive Bayes classifier and the two
generative models in more detail. In Sect. 3 we in-
troduce feature selection methods that take into ac-
count the extra information contained in the multi-
nomial model. In Sect. 4 we describe our experi-
ments and discuss the results. Finally, in Sect. 5
we draw some conclusions.
2 Naive Bayes Classifier
We follow the description of the Naive Bayes clas-
sifier given in McCallum and Nigam (1998). A
Bayesian classifier assumes that a document is
generated by a mixture model with parameters 0,
consisting of components C = {ci, cm } that
correspond to the classes. A document is gener-
ated by first selecting a component c3 E C ac-
cording to the prior distribution P(c3 18) and then
choosing a document di according to the parame-
ters of c3 with distribution P(di lc3 ; 0). The likeli-
hood of a document is given by the total probabil-
ity
0) = E p(ei
j=1
Of course, the true parameters 0 of the mixture
model are not known. Therefore, one estimates
the parameters from labeled training documents,
i.e. documents that have been manually annotated
with their correct class. We denote the estimated
parameters with 0. Given a set of training docu-
ments D = {d1, , dm }, the class prior parame-
ters are estimated as the fraction of training docu-
ments in c3 , using maximum likelihood:
= P(
where P(ci di ) is 1 if di E cj and 0 otherwise.
The estimation of P(dilc3; 0) depends on the gen-
erative model and is described below.
Given a new (unseen) document d, classifica-
tion of d is performed by computing the poste-
rior probability of each class, given d, by applying
Bayes' rule:
P( P(ci16)p(c!
	4\
ej ;„ )
P(d8) (3)
The classifier simply selects the class with the
highest posterior probability. Note that P(d18) is
P (di 0)P(di	 ; 0)	 (1)
(2)
308
the same for all classes, thus d can be classified by
computing
Cd = argmax P(ej 0)P(d cj; 0)	 (4)

2.1 Multi-variate Bernoulli Model
The multi-variate Bernoulli event model assumes
that a document is generated by a series of VI
Bernoulli experiments, one for each word w t in
the vocabulary V. The outcome of each experi-
ment determines whether the corresponding word
will be included at least once in the document.
Thus a document di can be represented as a bi-
nary feature vector of length I V. where each di-
mension t of the vector, denoted as Bit c {0, 1},
indicates whether word wt occurs at least once in
dz . The Naive Bayes assumption assumes that the
V trials are independent of each other. By mak-
ing the Naive Bayes assumption, we can compute
the probability of a document given a class from
the probabilities of the words given the class:
I vl
P(di Icj ; 0) = H(BitP(wt cj: 9)-k
(1 — Bit)(1 — P(wtIci; 0))) (5)
Note that words which do not occur in di con-
tribute to the probability of di as well. The param-
eters = P(w t, ci ; 0) of the mixture compo-
nent ci can be estimated as the fraction of training
documents in cj that contain w 1 : 1
6tvtle;	 P(wt Icj; 0) =
	 Bit P(ci di )
P(cildi)
	 (6)
2.2 Multinomial Model
The multinomial event model assumes that a doc-
ument d i of length di is generated by a sequence
of I d7 word events, where the outcome of each
event is a word from the vocabulary V. Following
McCallum and Nigam (1998), we assume that the
document length distribution P(Id, I) does not de-
pend on the class. Thus a document d i can be rep-
resented as a vector of length I V , where each di-
mension t of the vector, denoted as Nit > 0, is the
'McCallum and Nigam (1998) suggest to use a Laplacean
prior to smooth the probabilities, but we found that this de-
graded the performance of the classifier.
number of times word w t occurs in di. The Naive
Bayes assumption assumes that the dI trials are
independent of each other. By making the Naive
Bayes assumption, the probability of a document
given a class is the multinomial distribution:
Ivl	 (1—r P wt ci; 0) Nit
ci; ) =	 11 Nit!
(7)
The parameters O 	 = P(wt Ici; 0) of the mix-
ture component cj can be estimated as the fraction
of word occurrences in the training documents in
ci that are w t :

3 Feature Selection
3.1 Mutual Information
It is common to use only a subset of the vocabulary
for classification, in order to reduce over-fitting to
the training data and to speed up the classification
process. Following McCallum and Nigam (1998)
and Androutsopoulos et al. (2000b), we ranked
the words according to their average mutual in-
formation with the class variable and selected the
N highest ranked words. Average mutual infor-
mation between a word wt and the class vari-
able, denoted by M/(C; W1 ), is the difference be-
tween the entropy of the class variable, H(C),
and the entropy of the class variable given the in-
formation about the word, H(CI Wt ) (Cover and
Thomas, 1991). Intuitively, M/(C: VV) measures
how much bandwidth can be saved in the transmis-
sion of a class value when the information about
the word is known.
In the multi-variate Bernoulli model, Wt is a
random variable that takes on values ft E {0, 1},
indicating whether word w t occurs in a document
or not. Thus M/(C; Wt ) is the average mutual in-
formation between C and the absence or presence
of tot in a document:
p(c,
 ft) MI(C;Wt) — E E P(c, ft ) log P(e)P(ft)

3.2 Feature Selection in the Multinomial 	 used feature ranking functions of the form in (10):
Model
Mutual information as in (9) has also been used
for feature selection in the multinomial model, ei-
ther by estimating the probabilities P (e, ft ), P(c)
and P(h) as in the multi-variate model (McCal-
lum and Nigam, 1998) or by using the multinomial
probabilities (Mladenie and Grobelnik, 1999). Let
us call the two versions mv-M/ and mn-MI, respec-
tively.
mn-MI is not fully adequate as a feature ranking
function for the multinomial model. For example,
the token Subject : appears in every document
in the two corpora we used in our experiments
exactly once, and thus is completely uninforma-
tive. mv-M/ assigns 0 to this token, but mn-MI
yields a positive value because the average doc-
ument length in the classes is different, and thus
the class-conditional probabilities of the token are
different across classes in the multinomial model.
On the other hand, assume that some token occurs
once in every document in el and twice in every
document in e2, and that the average document
length in c2 is twice the average document length
in e l . Then both mv-M/ and mn-MI will assign 0
to the token, although it is clearly highly informa-
tive in the multinomial model.
We experimented with feature scoring functions
that take into account the average number of times
a word occurs in a document. Let N(ci, wt) =
vN(c 1 ) = N (c , w I ) and
N (w t) = Ej 1 N(ci , tut) denote the number
of times word w t occurs in class ej , the total
number of word occurrences in ej, and the total
number of occurrences of w t , respectively. Let
d(c) = En P(ci ldi ) denote the number of
documents in ej. Then the average number of
times wt occurs in a document in cj is defined
N(ci ./Dt)by mtfle", wt ) =  d(cj)  (mean term frequency).
The average number of times wt occurs in a docu-
ment is defined by mtflwt ) =  (") I DI •
In the multinomial model, a word is informative
with respect to the class value if its mean term fre-
quency in some class is different from its (global)
mean term frequency, i.e. if nuf(c3 '" ) I. We

R(c ) , w t ) measures the amount of information that
wt gives about cj . f (e3 , cut ) is a weighting func-
tion. Table 1 lists the feature ranking functions
that we used in our experiments. mn-MI is the av-
erage mutual information where the probabilities
are estimated as in the multinomial model. dmn-
MI differs from mn-MI in that the class prior prob-
abilities are estimated as the fraction of documents
in each class, rather than the fraction of word oc-
currences. YLMI, dtf-MI and tftf-MI use mean term
frequency to measure the correlation between w t
and cj and use different weighting functions.
4 Experiments
4.1 Corpora
We performed experiments on two publicly avail-
able E-mail corpora: 2 Ling-Spam (Androutsopou-
los et al., 2000b) and PU1 (Androutsopoulos et al.,
2000a). We trained a Naive Bayes classifier with
a multi-variate Bernoulli model and a multinomial
model on each of the two datasets.
The Ling-Spam corpus consists of 2412 mes-
sages from the Linguist list 3 and 481 spam mes-
sages. Thus spam messages are 16.6% of the
corpus. Attachments, HTML tags and all E-mail
headers except the Subject line have been stripped
off. We used the lemmatized version of the cor-
pus, with the tokenization given in the corpus and
with no additional processing, stop list, etc. The
total vocabulary size is 59829 words.
The PU1 corpus consists of 618 English legit-
imate messages and 481 spam messages. Mes-
sages in this corpus are encrypted: Each token
has been replaced by a unique number, such that
different occurrences of the same token get the
same number (the only non encrypted token is the
Subject : header name). Spam messages are
43.8% of the corpus. As with the Ling-Spam cor-
pus, we used the lemmatized version with no ad-

ditional processing. The total vocabulary size is
21706 words.
Both corpora are divided into 10 parts of equal
size, with equal proportion of legitimate and spam
messages across the 10 parts. Following (Androut-
sopoulos et al., 2000b), we used 10-fold cross-
validation in all experiments, using nine parts for
training and the remaining part for testing, with a
different test set in each trial. The evaluation mea-
sures were then averaged across the 10 iterations.
We performed experiments on each of the cor-
pora, using the multi-variate Bernoulli model with
my-MI, as well as the multinomial model with my-
MI and the feature ranking functions in Table 1,
and varying the number of selected words from 50
to 5000 by 50.
4.2 Results
For each event model and feature ranking func-
tion, we determined the minimum number of
words with highest recall for which recall equaled
precision (breakeven point). Tables 2 and 3
present the breakeven points with the number of
selected words, recall in each class, and accuracy.
In some cases, precision and recall were differ-
ent over the entire range of the number of selected
words. In these cases we give the recall and accu-
racy for the minimum number of words for which
accuracy was highest.
Figures 1 and 2 show recall curves for the multi-
variate Bernoulli model and three feature rank-
ing functions in the multinomial model for Ling-
Spam, and Figures 3 and 4 for PU I .
Some observations can be made from these re-
sults. First, the multi-variate Bernoulli model fa-
vors the Ling resp. Legit classes over the Spam
classes, whereas the multinomial model is more
balanced in conjunction with mv-MI, tf-MI and
tftf-MI. This may be due to the relatively specific
vocabulary used especially in the Ling-Spam cor-
pus, and to the uneven distribution of the doc-
uments in the classes. Second, the multinomial
model achieves higher accuracy than the multi-
variate Bernoulli model. tf-MI even achieves high
accuracy at a comparatively small vocabulary size
(1200 and 2400 words, respectively). In general,
PU1 seems to be more difficult to classify.
Androutsopoulos et al. (2000b) used cost-sen-
sitive evaluation metrics to account for the fact
that it may be more serious an error when a le-
gitimate message is classified as spam than vice
versa. However, such cost-sensitive measures are
problematic with a Naive Bayes classifier because
the probabilities computed by Naive Bayes are not
reliable, due to the independence assumptions it
makes. Therefore we did not use cost-sensitive
measures. 4
5 Conclusions
We performed experiments with two different sta-
tistical event models (a multi-variate Bernoulli
4Despite this, Naive Bayes can be an optimal classifier be-
cause it uses only the ranking implied by the probabilities, not
the probabilities themselves (Dorningos and Pazzani, 1997).

model and a multinomial model) for a Naive
Bayes text classifier using two publicly available
E-mail corpora. We used several feature ranking
functions for feature selection in the multinomial
model that explicitly take into account the word
frequency information contained in the multino-
mial document representation. The main conclu-
sion we draw from these experiments is that the
multinomial model is less biased towards one class
and can achieve higher accuracy than the multi-
variate Bernoulli model, in particular when fre-
quency information is taken into account also in
the feature selection process.
Our plans for future work are to evaluate the
feature selection functions for the multinomial
model introduced in this paper on other corpora,
and to provide a better theoretical foundation for
these functions. Most studies on feature selection
have concentrated on the multi-variate Bernoulli
model (Yang and Pedersen, 1997). We believe that
the information contained in the multinomial doc-
ument representation has been neglected in previ-
ous studies, and that the development of feature
selection functions especially for the multinomial
model could improve its performance.
