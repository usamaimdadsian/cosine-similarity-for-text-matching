ABSTRACT 
Computer synthesized speech is and will con- 
tinue to be an important feature of many artifi- 
cially intelligent systems. Although current 
computer synthesized speech is intelligible, it 
cannot yet pass a Turing test. One avenue for 
improving the intelligibility of computer synthe- 
sized speech and for making it more human-like is 
to incorporate stress patterns on words. But to 
achieve this improvement, a set of stress predic- 
tion rules amenable to computer implementation is 
needed. 
This paper evaluates one such theory for pre- 
dlcting stress, that of Liberman and Prince. It 
first gives an overview of the theory and then 
discusses modifications which were necessary for 
computer implementation. It then describes an 
experiment which was performed to determine the 
model's strengths and shortcomings. The paper con- 
cludes with the results of that study. 
I INTRODUCTION 
Since speech is such an important component 
of human activities, it is essential that it be 
included in computer systems simulating human 
behavior or performing human tasks. Advantages of 
interacting with a computer system capable of 
speech include tha= 
a) special equipment (e.g. a terminal) is 
unnecessary for receiving output from the 
device. 
b) the output may be communicated to several 
people simultaneously. 
c) it m~y be used to gain someone's atten- 
tion. 
d) it is useful in communicating information 
in an emergency.

The primary methods for generating computer 
synthesized speech are i) to use a lexicon of word 
pronunciations and then assemble a message from 
these stored words or 2) to use a letter-to-sound 
translator. A shortcoming common to both methods, 
and of interest to linguists and more recently 
computer scientists, is the inclusion of English 
prosody in computer synthesized speech e.g. Klatt 
\[6\], Lehlste \[8\], Wltten et al \[ll\] and Hill \[5\]. 
Of the three primary components of English 
prosody, this paper considers only stress (the 
other two are intonation and pause). It applies 
the theory for stress prediction proposed by lin- 
guists Mark Liberman and Alan Prince \[9\] to com- 
puter synthesized speech. Their theory was chosen 
primarily as a result of it having received wide- 
spread attention since its introduction (see 
Paradls \[lO\], Yip \[12\], FuJimura \[3 and 4\] and 
Basboll \[2\]). 
II THE LIBERMAN-PRINCE MODEL 
In addition to the attention it received, the 
Liberman-Prince model \[9\] (hereafter referred to 
as rhe LP model) is attractive for computer appli- 
cation for two other reasons. First, the majority 
of its rules can be applied without knowledge of 
the lexical category (part-of-speech) of the word 
being processed since the rules are based only on 
the sequences and attributes of letters in a word. 
This feature is especially important in an unre- 
stricted text-to-speech translation system. 
Secondly, since the metrical trees that define the 
prominence relations are a common data structure, 
a computer model may be designed which remains 
very close to the foundations and intentions of 
the theoretical model. 
This section will summarize the LP theory as 
presented in \[9\]. The LP method of predicting 
stress focuses on two attributes of vowels: ÷ or 
- !on~ and + or - low. The ~ of b~e is +lon~ while 
the £ of ~ is -lonE. Each of the vowels has 
both a + and - lon~ pronunciation. For example: 
state, sat, pint, pin, snow, pot, cute, and cup. 
The attribute + or - low is named for the height 
of the tongue in the mouth during articulation of 
the sound (see Figure i). During production of a 
+low vowel, the tongue is low in the mouth while 
it is high for a -lo.~w vowel. Speaking aloud the 
words in the figure demonstrates this difference.

Stress is not inherent to vowels in isolation 
but is present only wlthin words. Stress of a 
vowel phoneme wichln a word is a relative quality 
that is noticeable only by contrast with surround- 
ing phonemes. Consonant phonemes may also be 
defined in terms of several different actrlbuces, 
but within thls theory their main purpose is to 
combine with vowels Co complete the syllable 
s~ructure  of the words. 
In English, each syllable of a word moat con- 
cain aC least one vowel. A syllable can be a 
single vowel, rode-E; it may be an open syllable 
with the vowel at a syllable boundary, po-llce, 
ar-tlculate or it may be a closed syllable with 
the vowel surrounded by consonants, Mo__n-tana. The 
term 'vowel ~ in this context means vowel phoneme 
and noc orthographic vowel; the same is true for 
consonants. The c h in thine is considered a sin- 
gle consonant phoneme. 
The LP model defines context sensitive rules 
thac can be used co predict which vowels within a 
word should be s t ressed .  The three  ru le  types 
are: 
l) English Stress Rule and the Stress Retrac- 
tion Rule - ESR and SRR, 
2) English Descressing Rule - EDR, and 
3) Exceptionless Vowel Lengthening Rule - EVL. 
As the names imply, the first and second rules deal 
with assignment of + or - stress, while the third 
predicts which vowels should belong.  All three 
rules operate within a word from right to left. 
In the f i r s t  s tage ,  the shape of the penu l t i -  
mate (next - to - las t )  sy l lab le  determines the ass ign -  
ment of the + stress attribute using the ESR rule. 
"If the penultimate vowel is short and followed by 
(at most) one consonant, then stress falls on the 
preceding syllable," \[9\] as in Table l(a). "Zf 
the penultimate vowel is long \[Table l(b)\] or fol- 
lowed by two or more consonants \[Table l(c)\] then 
it must bear stress itself." \[9\] Each of ~he 
previous statements assumes the final vowel is 
short. The fourth case of the ESR says thac if the 
final vowel is long then ic must bear stress, 
Table l(d). (See \[9\] for exceptions Co this 
first s tage . )  
~n the second stage, the +stress attribute is 
assigned based on the position of the leftmost 
+stress vowel in the word. Since the rule 
retracts stress across the word It is called the 
Stress Retraction Rule (SRR). 
The ESR and SRR mark certain vowels to be 
stressed; this however does not imply that when 
the word is spoken, each of the vowels will be 
stressed. There are instances, depending on the 
characteristics of the word, where vowels will 
lose their stress through the application of the 
English Destressin8 Rule (EDR). 
The EDR depends on the notion of metrical 
crees whose purpose it is to give an alternating 
rhythm to the syllables of a word and define the 
relative prominence of each syllable within the 
word. Rhythm is reflected by the assignment of 
the actrlbuce ~, strong, to stressed syllables and 
w, weak, co unstressed syllables. For the words 
labor, ca?rlce, and Pamela the trees are simple 
(see Figure 2). The first rule in building the 
tree is if the vowel is -stress then its attribute 
is ~, if the vowel is +stress then it may be ~ or 
w. The root node of any independent subtree or 
the root node of the final tree is not labeled. 
The ~ E labeling defines a contrast between two 
adjacent components of a word; therefore, a SOfi- 
tary s or E would have no meaning.

Figure 2. Assignment of s and w. 
Each time a +stress is assigned by either the 
ESR or the SRR an attempt is made to add co the 
tree. As in the word labor a node is added to the 
tree and the vowels are marked s or w according to 
their stress markings, + or -. Next, any 
unattached vowels co the rlghc of the new node are 
added, as wlch Pamela. This builds a series of 
binary subcrees chat are necessarily left branchin~ 
193 
(see Figure 3). There are some situations where 
nothing can be added to the tree after the assign- 
ment of +stress. Such words cause a rephrasing o{ 
the second step above to become: next attach any 
vowels to the right of the present vowel that have 
not been attached durin 8 the operation of a pre- 
vious rule. 
These t%/o steps allow trees such as those in 
Figure 4 to be formed. Two questions remain. How 
is the tree completed? How are the ~, ~ relations 
defined above the vowel level? 
To answer the first question; after all 
unattached vowels to the right have been attached 
into a left branching subtree, this subtree is 
joined to the highest node of the subtree imme- 
diately to the right, if it exists (see Figure 5).

The ~, ~ assignment is made by the Lexical 
Category Prominence Rule (LCPR). In its simplest 
form it states: In the configuration \[N1,N2\] 
within a lexical category, N2 is s if and only if 
it branches. The LCPR has already been used in 
the stress assignments of teleological , Pamel@, 
and execute, to connect unattached vowels to the 
right of the + - sequences. The LCPR also follows 
the convention that no -stress vowel is assigned

To insure that all vowels are included in the 
tree, one final step is necessary as illustrated 
by the word Monongahela. Following the rules as 
previously outlined will generate a stress assign- 
ment and tree such as that in Figure 6(a). The 
first vowel must be included in the tree to pro- 
duce Figure 6(b), This is done as the last stage 
of tree building. The LCPR is used in this case 
to Join the vowel and the tree structure and to 
assign ~, w values.

The English Destressin8 Rule (EDR) is used to 
determ/ne which vowels should be reduced. Gener- 
ally t%/o things happen when a vowel is reduced. 
First, it will lose its +stress attribute and 
secondly, the vowel sound will be reduced to a 
schwa (an indeterminate sound in many unstressed 
syllables, e.g. the leading ~ in America). The 
rule is based on the tree prominance relations of 
the uuetrical trees, and is restricted to operating 
on only those vowels that have been marked +stress 
by either the ESR or SKE (see \[9\]). 
Finally the Exceptionless Vowel Lengthening 
Rule (see \[9\]) is applied to handle apparent 
exceptions in the operation of the ESR, e.g. words 
such as alien, simultaneous, radium and labia 
which contain a vowel sequence preceding the vowel 
to be stressed. 
III I~LE~iENTAT I ON 
Converting a theoretical model such as tha: 
proposed by LP into a computerized implementation 
poses problems. One concern is whether she rules 
and definitions of the theory are well suited to a 
computer implementation, or if not, must they be 
transformed to such an extent that they no longer 
resemble the originals? Fortunately the LP theory 
is expressed in rules and definitions that easily 
lend themselves to an implementation. 
Overcoming other problems while remaining 
close to the LP theory involves a careful combina- 
tion of three factors. First, certain modifica- 
tions must be made with the application of the 
rules for locating the +stress attribute and build- 
ing metrical trees. Second, several assumptions 
must be made about the exact definitions of the 
terms such as VOWEL and CONSONANT. Third, some of 
the rules which are too general must be restricted. 
None of these modifications causes a drastic 
reshaping of the model. 
Three outcomes exist for a word being pro- 
cessed by such a system. One, the stress pattern 
of the word will be correctly predicted. Two, the 
stress pattern of the word will be incorrectly 
pred ic ted .  Three ,  the  word w i l l  drop through 
w i thout  the  sys tem be ing  ab le  to p red ic t  any 
stress. Any modifications, assumptions or  
reet r i c t ioas  imposed shou ld  be done w i th  the  
pr imary  in tent  o f  reduc ing  the  number o f  words fo r  
which an incor rec t  s t ress  pat te rn  i s  p red ic ted ,  
even i f  th i s  means inc reas ing  the  number o f  words 
which drop through.  
One modlflcation was to use a phonetic trans- 
lation of the word instead of its s~andard spell- 
ing. This ~eant working from an underlying repre- 
sentation rather than the surface representation. 
By working from the underlying representation, the 
attributes +-stress, and +-low could be dlfferen- 
flared from the phonetic alphabet character 
directly because a +lon~ vowel and a -lon 8 vowel 
would be represented by two different characters 
in the phonetic alphabet. Four immediate results 
occur from maklng this modification. First, sin- 
gle consonant sounds such as the t_hhln thln~ are 
represented by a single character. However, the 
same is not true for dlpthongs. Both IPA symbols 
and VOTRAX codes (a VOTRAX ML-I speech synthesizer 
was used to output the results of the stress pre- 
diction) for d lpthongs  are multiple character 
codes. Second, in a phonet ic  translatlon all 
reduced vowels are already reduced. Therefore for 
the most part the EDR is of llttle value. It only 
retains its usefulness for initial syllables that 
are not stressed but whose vowel is not schwa. 
This syllable will draw stress by the SRR creating 
a situation for the EDR to apply. Third, the ESR 
and SRR also operate less freely because they will 
not apply stress to a schwa. Fourth, a new rule 
is required to operate in conjunction with the EVL. 
This rule must give a final +!on~ vowel, such as 
the ~ in stor~, the -lon~ attribute so that the 
ESR can correctly assign stress. 
A second change was that the SRR could be 
applied in accordance with the principle of dis- 
junctlve ordering. This situation results from 
the fact that a translator system has no lexicon. 
Although the words therefore cannot be marked for 
a particular type of s~rees retraction (SRR), it 
does not  cause  a major  problem. 
One implication of these modifications is the 
sequential ordering of the rules which group words 
into classes based solely on the characteristics 
of their phonetic translation. Therefore any set 
of stress rules should be organized in terms of a 
'best fi~' mode of application. Secondly, the 
stress rules cannot be defined in a way that can 
differentiate syllable boundaries, so no rule can 
be based on the concept of a 'light' or 'heavy' 
syllable. Although the stress rule input form does 
allow an affix option, it should be kept in mind 
that the e nn of enforce is considered a prefix as 
well as the ann of English. Finally, there can be 
no distinction between words based on the word 
stem or the word origin, except, in the case of 
word origin, if it can be defined in terms of a 
dlstinc~ affix. For example the Greek prefix 
hetero in: heterodox, heter0ny ~, or heterosexual 
is a candidate for long retraction by the SRR. 
Although the application model is a modified 
version of the LP model, it still operates in the 
manner of their original intent. 
IV EVALUATION 
An experiment was conducted to evaluate 
stress placemenc using the computerized version of 
the LP model. A random sample of unique English 
words and their correct phonetic translations used 
for the axperlment was selected from the American 
Heritage Dictionary \[i\]. Five hundred pairs of 
random numbers were generated; the first number in 
the pair was a random number between one and the 
page number of the last page in the dictionary and 
the second one was a random number between one and 
sixty. For each pair, the first number was the 
page on which the random word was to be found and 
the second number, 2, determined the word to be 
the ~'th on the page. If ~ was larger than the 
actual number of words on the page, then n modulo 
the number of words on the page was used. If the 
selected word was not polysyllabic, It was 
rejected. Using this technique, 357 unique random 
words were selected. Each word was translated 
into ASCII codes for the VOTRAX according to the 
phonetic translation in the dictionary. These 
translations were then given as input to the 
stress system. 
Because the words in the random sample con- 
tain combinatlons of primary, secondary, and 
tertiary stress, several methods arise for evalu- 
atlng the results (listed in the order of impor- 
tance): 
i) The number of words completely correct, 
the number of words incorrect, and the 
number of words which dropped through. 
2) The number of times primary, secondary, 
and tertiar 7 stress were each individually 
predicted correctly regardless of the 
other two. 
3) The number of times when secondary or 
tertiary stress was incorrectly predicted. 
4) The number of rimes secondary or tertiary 
stress was predicted but the word did not 
requ i re  it. 
5) The number of times secondary or tertiary 
stress was needed but not predicted. 
The figures for the first evaluation are shown 
in Table 2. The totally correct words are slightly 
under two thirds of the entire sample. However, 
when the words with correct stress and the words 
which fell through are combined, the total is 
slightly over 70X.

The results of the second evaluation are 
shown in Table 3. While primary stress is pre- 
dicted correctly in 75% of the cases, secondary 
stress is only 53Z and tertiary stress occurs too 
infrequently to make any observations. The number 
in parentheses in Table 3 indicates the total num- 
ber of the particular stress level required. 
words of Table 2. The importance of this fact 
appears when one considers that the stress pattern 
is partially correct, but is not distortec by 
incorrect stressing. Therefore even though par- 
tial, this stress pattern would be an improvement. 
If these words are now combined with the totally 
correct words and those which dropped through, 
they equal 291 words or 81.51%, i.e. almost 82~ of 
the words can be stressed totally, partially, or 
left unchanged.

The third evaluation results are shown in 
Table 4. The 19Z in which secondary stress was 
placed on the wrong syllable is small but still 
significant. Again tertiary stress occurrences 
were too few to make observations.

With 63.3% of the sample words completely 
correct, 73.10% of the sample words completely or 
partially correct, 8.4% unmodified and 18.49% in 
error, this test has demonstrated that the stress 
model defined by the stress system and its input 
rules does work in a substantial percentage of 
cases. 
Of the 66 words that were incorrectly 
stressed, most fall into one of four categories. 
I) Two syllable words where the vowel 
pattern is -lons -lon~ or +lons +lon~ and 
the last syllable is stressed. In these 
cases the stress system incorrectly 
assigns stress to the first vowel: e.g., 
transact, mistrust. 
2) Words in which the ESR or SKR skips over 
syllables that should be stressed, e.g. 
isodynamic, epox-/, comprehend, remitter, 
inopportune. 
The results of the fourth test are given in 
Table 5. Considering that there were 357 words in 
the sample, this is a relatively small number of 
erroneous predictions. 
TABLE 5. Stress that should not have been 
predicted. 
Secondary Tertiary 
# 3 1 
Finally the fifth evaluation leads to Table 6. 
This table shows the number of times secondary or 
tertiary stress was required but not predicted. An 
interpretation of this table suggests that for 35 
words which needed both primary and secondary 
stress, only primary stress was predicted. These 
words are also included in the incorrectly stressed 
3) When in a two syllable word, the word 
stem vowel is short and the prefix or 
suffix vowel is long, the long vowel is 
marked for stress, e.g. fancied. 
4) The LCPR does not correctly assign nodes 
~, ~, values, e.g. contumacy, Kastight. 
Each of these groups is an exception to a larger 
group whose stress patterns fit the predicted 
patterns. 
A final question is: How well does this 
system predict stress in the most common English 
words? Of the 200 most common, 162 have a single 
vowel in their phonetic translation and therefore 
would drop through the system without being modi- 
fied. Of the 38 remaining words, 33 are correctly 
stressed by the stress system, leaving 5 incor- 
rectly stressed. However, since these are the 
most common of words of English, it would seem 
reasonable to include these words as special rules 
196 
in the rule system of the translator and not allow 
the stress system to operate on them. 
V SUI~t~Y 
Computer synthesized speech and linguistic 
theories for predicting stress can interact with 
one another to mutual benefit. Computer synthe- 
sized speech techniques can be used to evaluate 
the linguistic theory. Just as computers have 
been used so often to evaluate theories in other 
disclpllnes, so too can ~hey be used in linguis- 
tics. The organizationt speed, accuracy and 
unblasedness of the computer makes it superior 
to a person in many respects for Judging a 
hypothesis. 
On the other hand, the linguistic theories 
can provide a substantial base on which to build 
language components of artificially intelligent 
systems. The intelligibility of computer syn- 
thesized speech can be improved with the applica- 
tion of linguistic theories for predicting stress 
such as that proposed by Liberman and Prince. 
Evaluations such as that presented in this 
paper will be of value not only in comparing com- 
peting theories but will also be helpful in deter- 
m/ning whether the accuracy of a theory's predlc- 
tions is acceptable for a particular application 
and where improvements ,my be made to the theory.
