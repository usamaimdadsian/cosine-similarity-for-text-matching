Abstract
Coreference systems are driven by syntactic, se-
mantic, and discourse constraints. We present
a simple approach which completely modularizes
these three aspects. In contrast to much current
work, which focuses on learning and on the dis-
course component, our system is deterministic and
is driven entirely by syntactic and semantic com-
patibility as learned from a large, unlabeled corpus.
Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our
system substantially outperforms all unsupervised
systems and most supervised ones. Primary con-
tributions include (1) the presentation of a simple-
to-reproduce, high-performing baseline and (2) the
demonstration that most remaining errors can be at-
tributed to syntactic and semantic factors external
to the coreference phenomenon (and perhaps best
addressed by non-coreference systems).
1 Introduction
The resolution of entity reference is influenced by
a variety of constraints. Syntactic constraints like
the binding theory, the i-within-i filter, and appos-
itive constructions restrict reference by configura-
tion. Semantic constraints like selectional compat-
ibility (e.g. a spokesperson can announce things)
and subsumption (e.g. Microsoft is a company)
rule out many possible referents. Finally, dis-
course phenomena such as salience and centering
theory are assumed to heavily influence reference
preferences. As these varied factors have given
rise to a multitude of weak features, recent work
has focused on how best to learn to combine them
using models over reference structures (Culotta et
al., 2007; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Klenner and
Ailloud, 2007).
In this work, we break from the standard view.
Instead, we consider a vastly more modular system
in which coreference is predicted from a determin-
istic function of a few rich features. In particu-
lar, we assume a three-step process. First, a self-
contained syntactic module carefully represents
syntactic structures using an augmented parser and
extracts syntactic paths from mentions to potential
antecedents. Some of these paths can be ruled in
or out by deterministic but conservative syntactic
constraints. Importantly, the bulk of the work in
the syntactic module is in making sure the parses
are correctly constructed and used, and this mod-
ule’s most important training data is a treebank.
Second, a self-contained semantic module evalu-
ates the semantic compatibility of headwords and
individual names. These decisions are made from
compatibility lists extracted from unlabeled data
sources such as newswire and web data. Finally,
of the antecedents which remain after rich syntac-
tic and semantic filtering, reference is chosen to
minimize tree distance.
This procedure is trivial where most systems are
rich, and so does not need any supervised corefer-
ence data. However, it is rich in important ways
which we argue are marginalized in recent coref-
erence work. Interestingly, error analysis from our
final system shows that its failures are far more
often due to syntactic failures (e.g. parsing mis-
takes) and semantic failures (e.g. missing knowl-
edge) than failure to model discourse phenomena
or appropriately weigh conflicting evidence.
One contribution of this paper is the exploration
of strong modularity, including the result that our
system beats all unsupervised systems and ap-
proaches the state of the art in supervised ones.
Another contribution is the error analysis result
that, even with substantial syntactic and semantic
richness, the path to greatest improvement appears
to be to further improve the syntactic and semantic
modules. Finally, we offer our approach as a very
strong, yet easy to implement, baseline. We make
no claim that learning to reconcile disparate fea-
tures in a joint model offers no benefit, only that it
must not be pursued to the exclusion of rich, non-
reference analysis.
2 Coreference Resolution
In coreference resolution, we are given a docu-
ment which consists of a set of mentions; each
1152
mention is a phrase in the document (typically
an NP) and we are asked to cluster mentions ac-
cording to the underlying referent entity. There
are three basic mention types: proper (Barack
Obama), nominal (president), and pronominal
(he).
1
For comparison to previous work, we eval-
uate in the setting where mention boundaries are
given at test time; however our system can easily
annotate reference on all noun phrase nodes in a
parse tree (see Section 3.1.1).
2.1 Data Sets
In this work we use the following data sets:
Development: (see Section 3)
• ACE2004-ROTH-DEV: Dev set split of the ACE
2004 training set utilized in Bengston and
Roth (2008). The ACE data also annotates
pre-nominal mentions which we map onto
nominals. 68 documents and 4,536 mentions.
Testing: (see Section 4)
• ACE2004-CULOTTA-TEST: Test set split of the
ACE 2004 training set utilized in Culotta et
al. (2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008).
Consists of 107 documents.
2
• ACE2004-NWIRE: ACE 2004 Newswire set to
compare against Poon and Domingos (2008).
Consists of 128 documents and 11,413 men-
tions; intersects with the other ACE data sets.
• MUC-6-TEST: MUC6 formal evaluation set
consisting of 30 documents and 2,068 men-
tions.
Unlabeled: (see Section 3.2)
• BLIPP: 1.8 million sentences of newswire
parsed with the Charniak (2000) parser. No
labeled coreference data; used for mining se-
mantic information.
• WIKI: 25k articles of English Wikipedia ab-
stracts parsed by the Klein and Manning
(2003) parser.
3
No labeled coreference data;
used for mining semantic information.

Other mention types exist and are annotated (such as pre-
nominal), which are treated as nominals in this work.
2
The evaluation set was not made available to non-
participants.

Wikipedia abstracts consist of roughly the first paragraph
of the corresponding article
2.2 Evaluation
We will present evaluations on multiple corefer-
ence resolution metrics, as no single one is clearly
superior:
• Pairwise F1: precision, recall, and F1 over
all pairs of mentions in the same entity clus-
ter. Note that this over-penalizes the merger
or separation of clusters quadratically in the
size of the cluster.
• b
3
(Amit and Baldwin, 1998): For each men-
tion, form the intersection between the pre-
dicted cluster and the true cluster for that
mention. The precision is the ratio of the in-
tersection and the true cluster sizes and recall
the ratio of the intersection to the predicted
sizes; F1 is given by the harmonic mean over
precision and recall from all mentions.
• MUC (Vilain et al., 1995): For each true clus-
ter, compute the number of predicted clusters
which need to be merged to cover the true
cluster. Divide this quantity by true cluster
size minus one. Recall is given by the same
procedure with predicated and true clusters
reversed.
4
• CEAF (Luo, 2005): For a similarity function
between predicted and true clusters, CEAF
scores the best match between true and pre-
dicted clusters using this function. We use
the ?
3
similarity function from Luo (2005).
3 System Description
In this section we develop our system and re-
port developmental results on ACE2004-ROTH-
DEV (see Section 2.1); we report pairwise F1 fig-
ures here, but report on many more evaluation
metrics in Section 4. At a high level, our system
resembles a pairwise coreference model (Soon et
al., 1999; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Bengston and
Roth, 2008); for each mention m
i
, we select ei-
ther a single-best antecedent amongst the previ-
ous mentions m
1
, . . . ,m
i?1
, or the NULL men-
tion to indicate the underlying entity has not yet
been evoked. Mentions are linearly ordered ac-
cording to the position of the mention head with
ties being broken by the larger node coming first.
4
The MUC measure is problematic when the system pre-
dicts many more clusters than actually exist (Luo, 2005;
Finkel and Manning, 2008); also, singleton clusters do not
contribute to evaluation.
1153
While much research (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Cu-
lotta et al., 2007; Haghighi and Klein, 2007; Poon
and Domingos, 2008; Finkel and Manning, 2008)
has explored how to reconcile pairwise decisions
to form coherent clusters, we simply take the tran-
sitive closure of our pairwise decision (as in Ng
and Cardie (2002) and Bengston and Roth (2008))
which can and does cause system errors.
In contrast to most recent research, our pair-
wise decisions are not made with a learned model
which outputs a probability or confidence, but in-
stead for each mentionm
i
, we select an antecedent
amongst m
1
, . . . ,m
i?1
or the NULL mention as
follows:
• Syntactic Constraint: Based on syntac-
tic configurations, either force or disallow
coreference between the mention and an an-
tecedent. Propagate this constraint (see Fig-
ure 4).
• Semantic/Syntactic Filter: Filter the re-
maining possible antecedents based upon
compatibility with the mention (see Fig-
ure 2).
• Selection: Select the ‘closest’ mention from
the set of remaining possible antecedents (see
Figure 1) or the NULL antecedent if empty.
Initially, there is no syntactic constraint (im-
proved in Section 3.1.3), the antecedent com-
patibility filter allows proper and nominal men-
tions to corefer only with mentions that have the
same head (improved in Section 3.2), and pro-
nouns have no compatibility constraints (improved
in Section 3.1.2). Mention heads are determined
by parsing the given mention span with the Stan-
ford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and us-
ing the Collins head rules (Collins, 1999); Poon
and Domingos (2008) showed that using syntactic
heads strongly outperformed a simple rightmost
headword rule. The mention type is determined
by the head POS tag: proper if the head tag is NNP
or NNPS, pronoun if the head tag is PRP, PRP$, WP,
or WP$, and nominal otherwise.
For the selection phase, we order mentions
m
1
, . . . ,m
i?1
according to the position of the
head word and select the closest mention that re-
mains after constraint and filtering are applied.
This choice reflects the intuition of Grosz et al.
(1995) that speakers only use pronominal men-
tions when there are not intervening compatible

mentions. This system yields a rather low 48.9
pairwise F1 (see BASE-FLAT in Table 2). There
are many, primarily recall, errors made choos-
ing antecedents for all mention types which we
will address by adding syntactic and semantic con-
straints.
3.1 Adding Syntactic Information
In this section, we enrich the syntactic represen-
tation and information in our system to improve
results.
3.1.1 Syntactic Salience
We first focus on fixing the pronoun antecedent
choices. A common error arose from the use of
mention head distance as a poor proxy for dis-
course salience. For instance consider the exam-
ple in Figure 1, the mention America is closest
to its in flat mention distance, but syntactically
Nintendo of America holds a more prominent syn-
tactic position relative to the pronoun which, as
Hobbs (1977) argues, is key to discourse salience.
MappingMentions to Parse Nodes: In order to
use the syntactic position of mentions to determine
anaphoricity, we must associate each mention in
the document with a parse tree node. We parse
all document sentences with the Stanford parser,
and then for each evaluation mention, we find the
largest-span NP which has the previously deter-
mined mention head as its head.
5
Often, this re-
sults in a different, typically larger, mention span
than annotated in the data.
Now that each mention is situated in a parse
tree, we utilize the length of the shortest tree path
between mentions as our notion of distance. In
5
If there is no NP headed by a given mention head, we
add an NP over just that word.

Figure 2: Example of a coreference decision fixed
by agreement constraints (see Section 3.1.2). The
pronoun them is closest to the sitemention, but has
an incompatible number feature with it. The clos-
est (in tree distance, see Section 3.1.1) compatible
mention is The Israelis, which is correct
particular, this fixes examples such as those in
Figure 1 where the true antecedent has many em-
bedded mentions between itself and the pronoun.
This change by itself yields 51.7 pairwise F1 (see
BASE-TREE in Table 2), which is small overall, but
reduces pairwise pronoun antecedent selection er-
ror from 51.3% to 42.5%.
3.1.2 Agreement Constraints
We now refine our compatibility filtering to in-
corporate simple agreement constraints between
coreferent mentions. Since we currently allow
proper and nominal mentions to corefer only with
matching head mentions, agreement is only a con-
cern for pronouns. Traditional linguistic theory
stipulates that coreferent mentions must agree in
number, person, gender, and entity type (e.g. an-
imacy). Here, we implement person, number and
entity type agreement.
6
A number feature is assigned to each mention
deterministically based on the head and its POS
tag. For entity type, we use NER labels. Ideally,
we would like to have information about the en-
tity type of each referential NP, however this in-
formation is not easily obtainable. Instead, we opt
to utilize the Stanford NER tagger (Finkel et al.,
2005) over the sentences in a document and anno-
tate each NP with the NER label assigned to that
mention head. For each mention, when its NP is
assigned an NER label we allow it to only be com-
patible with that NER label.
7
For pronouns, we
deterministically assign a set of compatible NER
values (e.g. personal pronouns can only be a PER-
6
Gender agreement, while important for general corefer-
ence resolution, did not contribute to the errors in our largely
newswire data sets.

Or allow it to be compatible with all NER labels if the

We incorporate agreement constraints by filter-
ing the set of possible antecedents to those which
have compatible number and NER types with the
target mention. This yields 53.4 pairwise F1, and
reduces pronoun antecedent errors to 42.5% from
34.4%. An example of the type of error fixed by
these agreement constraints is given by Figure 2.

later. However, some syntactic configurations

Figure 3: NP structure annotation: In (a) we have the raw parse from the Klein and Manning (2003)
parser with the mentions annotated by entity. In (b), we demonstrate the annotation we have added. NER
labels are added to all NP according to the NER label given to the head (see Section 3.1.1). Appositive
NPs are also annotated. Hashes indicate forced coreferent nodes
guarantee coreference. The one exploited most
in coreference work (Soon et al., 1999; Ng and
Cardie, 2002; Luo et al., 2004; Culotta et al., 2007;
Poon and Domingos, 2008; Bengston and Roth,
2008) is the appositive construction. Here, we rep-
resent apposition as a syntactic feature of an NP
indicating that it is coreferent with its parent NP
(e.g. it is an exception to the i-within-i constraint
that parent and child NPs cannot be coreferent).
We deterministically mark a node as NP-APPOS
(see Figure 3) when it is the third child in of a par-
ent NP whose expansion begins with (NP , NP),
and there is not a conjunction in the expansion (to
avoid marking elements in a list as appositive).
Role Appositives: During development, we dis-
covered many errors which involved a variant of
appositives which we call ‘role appositives’ (see
painter in Figure 3), where an NP modifying the
head NP describes the role of that entity (typi-
cally a person entity). There are several challenges
to correctly labeling these role NPs as being ap-
positives. First, the NPs produced by Treebank
parsers are flat and do not have the required inter-
nal structure (see Figure 3(a)). While fully solving
this problem is difficult, we can heuristically fix
many instances of the problem by placing an NP
around maximum length sequences of NNP tags
or NN (and JJ) tags within an NP; note that this
will fail for many constructions such as U.S. Pres-
ident Barack Obama, which is analyzed as a flat
sequence of proper nouns. Once this internal NP
structure has been added, whether the NP immedi-
ately to the left of the head NP is an appositive de-
pends on the entity type. For instance, Rabbi Ashi
is an apposition but Iranian army is not. Again, a
full solution would require its own model, here we
mark as appositions any NPs immediately to the
left of a head child NP where the head child NP is
identified as a person by the NER tagger.
9
We incorporate NP appositive annotation as a
constraint during filtering. Any mention which
corresponds to an appositive node has its set of
possible antecedents limited to its parent. Along
with the appositive constraint, we implement the
i-within-i constraint that any non-appositive NP
cannot be be coreferent with its parent; this con-
straint is then propagated to any node its parent
is forced to agree with. The order in which these
constraints are applied is important, as illustrated
by the example in Figure 4: First the list of pos-
sible antecedents for the appositive NP is con-
strained to only its parent. Now that all apposi-
tives have been constrained, we apply the i-within-
i constraint, which prevents its from having the NP
headed by brand in the set of possible antecedents,
and by propagation, also removes the NP headed
by Gitano. This leaves the NP Wal-Mart as the
closest compatible mention.
Adding these syntactic constraints to our system
yields 55.4 F1, a fairly substantial improvement,
but many recall errors remain between mentions
with differing heads. Resolving such cases will
require external semantic information, which we
will automatically acquire (see Section 3.2).
Predicate Nominatives: Another syntactic con-
straint exploited in Poon and Domingos (2008) is
the predicate nominative construction, where the
object of a copular verb (forms of the verb be) is
constrained to corefer with its subject (e.g. Mi-
crosoft is a company in Redmond). While much
less frequent than appositive configurations (there
are only 17 predicate nominatives in our devel-
9
Arguably, we could also consider right modifying NPs
(e.g., [Microsoft [Company]
1
]
1
) to be role appositive, but we
do not do so here.

opment set), predicate nominatives are another
highly reliable coreference pattern which we will
leverage in Section 3.2 to mine semantic knowl-
edge. As with appositives, we annotate object
predicate-nominative NPs and constrain corefer-
ence as before. This yields a minor improvement
to 55.5 F1.
3.2 Semantic Knowledge
While appositives and related syntactic construc-
tions can resolve some cases of non-pronominal
reference, most cases require semantic knowledge
about the various entities as well as the verbs used
in conjunction with those entities to disambiguate
references (Kehler et al., 2008).
However, given a semantically compatible men-
tion head pair, say AOL and company, one
might expect to observe a reliable appositive
or predicative-nominative construction involving
these mentions somewhere in a large corpus.
In fact, the Wikipedia page for AOL
10
has a
predicate-nominative construction which supports
the compatibility of this head pair: AOL LLC (for-
merly America Online) is an American global In-
ternet services and media company operated by
Time Warner.
In order to harvest compatible head pairs, we
utilize our BLIPP and WIKI data sets (see Sec-
tion 2), and for each noun (proper or common) and
pronoun, we assign a maximal NP mention node
for each nominal head as in Section 3.1.1; we then
annotate appositive and predicate-nominative NPs
as in Section 3.1.3. For any NP which is annotated
as an appositive or predicate-nominative, we ex-
tract the head pair of that node and its constrained
antecedent.
10
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL
The resulting set of compatible head words,
while large, covers a little more than half of the
examples given in Table 1. The problem is that
these highly-reliable syntactic configurations are
too sparse and cannot capture all the entity infor-
mation present. For instance, the first sentence of
Wikipedia abstract for Al Gore is:
Albert Arnold “Al” Gore, Jr. is an
American environmental activist who
served as the 45th Vice President of the
United States from 1993 to 2001 under
President Bill Clinton.
The required lexical pattern X who served as Y is
a general appositive-like pattern that almost surely
indicates coreference. Rather than opt to manu-
ally create a set of these coreference patterns as in
Hearst (1992), we instead opt to automatically ex-
tract these patterns from large corpora as in Snow
et al. (2004) and Phillips and Riloff (2007). We
take a simple bootstrapping technique: given a
set of mention pairs extracted from appositives
and predicate-nominative configurations, we ex-
tract counts over tree fragments between nodes
which have occurred in this set of head pairs (see
Figure 5); the tree fragments are formed by an-
notating the internal nodes in the tree path with
the head word and POS along with the subcatego-
rization. We limit the paths extracted in this way
in several ways: paths are only allowed to go be-
tween adjacent sentences and have a length of at
most 10. We then filter the set of paths to those
which occur more than a hundred times and with
at least 10 distinct seed head word pairs.
The vast majority of the extracted fragments are
variants of traditional appositives and predicate-
nominatives with some of the structure of the NPs

specified. However there are some tree fragments
which correspond to the novel coreference pat-
terns (see Figure 5) of parenthetical alias as well
as conjunctions of roles in NPs.
We apply our extracted tree fragments to our
BLIPP and WIKI data sets and extract a set of com-
patible word pairs which match these fragments;
these words pairs will be used to relax the seman-
tic compatibility filter (see the start of the section);
mentions are compatible with prior mentions with
the same head or with a semantically compatible
head word. This yields 58.5 pairwise F1 (see SEM-
COMPAT in Table 2) as well as similar improve-
ments across other metrics.
By and large the word pairs extracted in this
way are correct (in particular we now have cov-
erage for over two-thirds of the head pair recall
errors from Table 1.) There are however word-
pairs which introduce errors. In particular city-
state constructions (e.g. Los Angeles, California)
appears to be an appositive and incorrectly allows
our system to have angeles as an antecedent for
california. Another common error is that the %
symbol is made compatible with a wide variety of
common nouns in the financial domain.
4 Experimental Results
We present formal experimental results here
(see Table 2). We first evaluate our model
on the ACE2004-CULOTTA-TEST dataset used in
the state-of-the-art systems from Culotta et al.
(2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008). Both of
these systems were supervised systems discrimi-
natively trained to maximize b
3
and used features
from many different structured resources includ-
ing WordNet, as well as domain-specific features
(Culotta et al., 2007). Our best b
3
result of 79.0
is broadly in the range of these results. We should
note that in our work we use neither the gold men-
tion types (we do not model pre-nominals sepa-
rately) nor do we use the gold NER tags which
Bengston and Roth (2008) does. Across metrics,
the syntactic constraints and semantic compatibil-
ity components contribute most to the overall final
result.
On the MUC6-TEST dataset, our system outper-

supervised Markov Logic Network system which
uses explicit constraints) and Finkel and Manning
(2008) (a supervised system which uses ILP in-
ference to reconcile the predictions of a pairwise
classifier) on all comparable measures.

Simi-
larly, on the ACE2004-NWIRE dataset, we also out-
perform the state-of-the-art unsupervised system
of Poon and Domingos (2008).
Overall, we conclude that our system outper-
forms state-of-the-art unsupervised systems
12
and
is in the range of the state-of-the art systems of Cu-
lotta et al. (2007) and Bengston and Roth (2008).
5 Error Analysis
There are several general trends to the errors made
by our system. Table 3 shows the number of
pairwise errors made on MUC6-TEST dataset by
mention type; note these errors are not equally
weighted in the final evaluations because of the
transitive closure taken at the end. The most er-
rors are made on nominal mentions with pronouns
coming in a distant second. In particular, we most
frequently say a nominal is NULL when it has an
antecedent; this is typically due to not having the
necessary semantic knowledge to link a nominal
to a prior expression.
In order to get a more thorough view of the
cause of pairwise errors, we examined 20 random
errors made in aligning each mention type to an
antecedent. We categorized the errors as follows:
• SEM. COMPAT: Missing information about
the compatibility of two words e.g. pay and
wage. For pronouns, this is used to mean that
11
Klenner and Ailloud (2007) took essentially the same ap-
proach but did so on non-comparable data.
12
Poon and Domingos (2008) outperformed Haghighi and
Klein (2007). Unfortunately, we cannot compare against Ng
(2008) since we do not have access to the version of the ACE
data used in their evaluation.
we incorrectly aligned a pronoun to a men-
tion with which it is not semantically com-
patible (e.g. he aligned to board).
• SYN. COMPAT: Error in assigning linguistic
features of nouns for compatibility with pro-
nouns (e.g. disallowing they to refer to team).
• HEAD: Errors involving the assumption that
mentions with the same head are always com-
patible. Includes modifier and specificity er-
rors such as allowing Lebanon and Southern
Lebanon to corefer. This also includes errors
of definiteness in nominals (e.g. the people
in the room and Chinese people). Typically,
these errors involve a combination of missing
syntactic and semantic information.
• INTERNAL NP: Errors involving lack of inter-
nal NP structure to mark role appositives (see
Section 3.1.3).
• PRAG. / DISC.: Errors where discourse salience
or pragmatics are needed to disambiguate
mention antecedents.
• PROCESS ERROR: Errors which involved a tok-
enization, parse, or NER error.
The result of this error analysis is given in Ta-
ble 4; note that a single error may be attributed to
more than one cause. Despite our efforts in Sec-
tion 3 to add syntactic and semantic information
to our system, the largest source of error is still
a combination of missing semantic information or
annotated syntactic structure rather than the lack
of discourse or salience modeling.
Our error analysis suggests that in order to im-
prove the state-of-the-art in coreference resolu-
tion, future research should consider richer syntac-
tic and semantic information than typically used in
current systems.
6 Conclusion
Our approach is not intended as an argument
against the more complex, discourse-focused ap-
proaches that typify recent work. Instead, we note
that rich syntactic and semantic processing vastly
reduces the need to rely on discourse effects or ev-
idence reconciliation for reference resolution. In-
deed, we suspect that further improving the syn-
tactic and semantic modules in our system may
produce greater error reductions than any other

route forward. Of course, a system which is rich
in all axes will find some advantage over any sim-
plified approach.
Nonetheless, our coreference system, despite
being relatively simple and having no tunable pa-
rameters or complexity beyond the non-reference
complexity of its component modules, manages
to outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised coref-
erence resolution and be broadly comparable to
state-of-the-art supervised systems.
