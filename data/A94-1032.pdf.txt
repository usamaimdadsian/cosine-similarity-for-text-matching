Abstract 
This paper proposes a method that automatically 
acquires the SAs (semantic attributes) of user defined 
words. Applying this method to the compilation of a user 
dictionary targeting newspaper article sentences and 
sentences ofsoftware design documents has revealed that 
the automatically determined SAs include 50 to 80% of 
the correct attributes. Translation experiments confirmed 
that the automatically acquired SAs improved translation 
quality by 6-13%. 
1. Introduct ion 
When working with a MT(machine translation) system, 
users compile user dictionaries for the words which are not 
registered in the system dictionaries or for those with 
inappropriate ranslations \[1\]. But when registering new 
words in a dictionary, there is a need to give not just the 
index word and translated word, but also syntactic, 
semantic and various other information. Systems aiming at 
higher levels of translation quality require more detailed 
and accurate information \[2,3\], and it is no simple task for 
laymen to give such information. In particular, semantic 
information usually requires the skill of professionals. 
In this paper, attention has been focused on the 
characteristics of user defined words. A method is 
proposed where for index words (noun words or compound 
nouns) in the original language that users eek to register, 
one need give only the translation i  the target language to 
permit he system apply the knowledge held in the system 
dictionaries, automatically judge the type of noun and 
determine the SAs of the word for the noun types. 
2. System Dictionaries and User Dictionaries 
2.1 Semant ic  Dict ionaries in ALT- J /E  
Here, we shall refer to the dictionary prepared in 
advance by the MT system as a system dictionary and the 
dictionary prepared and used by users as a user dictionary. 
Semantic Attribute Systems

For the case of the Japanese to English MT system 
ALT-J/E\[4\], the relationship between the system 
dictionaries, the user dictionaries and word SAs are shown 
in Figure 1. In the semantic dictionaries, semantic 
information is written using SAs. 
Common nouns in the semantic word dictionary are 
given common oun SAs (generally more than one). For 
proper nouns, both common oun SAs and proper noun 
S/ks(beth more than one) are given. Verbal SAs are given 
to sentence patterns registered in the semantic structure 
dictionary \[5\]. 
3. Determinat ion  of Semant ic  Attr ibutes 
A method of determining the SAs of user defined words 
is shown in Figure 2. This method works using the 
information held in the system dictionaries when index 
words (Japanese xpressions) of user defined words and 
their translations(English) have been provided by the user.

The procedures consist of determining the head

noun SAs (for proper nouns) and common oun SAs (for 
beth common and proper nouns). 
SAs are determined using information from index

4. Evaluation 
The proposed method was used to determine the SAs 
to create user dictionaries for translating newspaper 
articles and software design documents shown in Tabe 3. 
The following 3 methods were examined. 
(~) Automatic Determination (Proposed Method) 
(~) Manual Determination (Manual Method) 
(~) Experimental Determination (Correct Attributes) 
(1) Accuracy of Noun Type (Table 2) 
In the case of newspaper articles, the method's accuracy 
in determining the noun type was 93.5%. Manual 
determination achieved an accuracy rote of 94.8%. Similar 
results were obtained for the software specification 
documents.

5. Improvements  in Translation Quality (Table 4) 
Translation experiments were conducted for the 4 cases 
(3 cases shown in the section 4 plus the case without SAs) 
*'It

26 + 51= 77Wds 98 +7= 105Wds 
using the same texts used in the above sectiom 
It can be seen in table 4 that using the automatically 
determined SAs improved the translation quality by 
6-13%. This improvement is almost he same as that 
achieved with manually determined SAs. The translation 
success rate is 2-3% lower than that achieved with the 
correct attributes. This is, however, satisfactory if we 
consider the high cost needed to obtain the correct 
attribute by repeatedly tuning them. 
Thus, automatic determination makes it possible to 
acquire useful sets of SAs; a task which normally requires 
the most labor in creating user dictionaries. 
6. Summary 
A method that automatically determines the SAs of user 
defined words was proposed. The method was applied to 
create the dictionaries needed to translate several 
newspaper a ticles and some software specifications. The 
results show that the automatically determined SAs 
include 50 to 80% of the correct attributes. This value is 
5-10% smaller than that achieved with manual 
determination (50 "~ 90%), but is still high enough to 
improve translation quality. Translation experiments 
confirmed that using the automatically determined SAs 
improved translation quality by 6-13%.
