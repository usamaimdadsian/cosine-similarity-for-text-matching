Abstract
We investigate the value-add of topic model-
ing in text analysis for depression, and for neu-
roticism as a strongly associated personality
measure. Using Pennebaker’s Linguistic In-
quiry and Word Count (LIWC) lexicon to pro-
vide baseline features, we show that straight-
forward topic modeling using Latent Dirich-
let Allocation (LDA) yields interpretable, psy-
chologically relevant “themes” that add value
in prediction of clinical assessments.
1 Introduction
In the United States, where 25 million adults per
year suffer a major depressive episode (NAMI,
2013), identifying people with mental health prob-
lems is a key challenge. For clinical psychologists,
language plays a central role in diagnosis: many
clinical instruments fundamentally rely on what is,
in effect, manual coding of patient language. Au-
tomating language assessment in this domain poten-
tially has enormous impact, for two reasons. First,
conventional clinical assessments for affective dis-
orders (e.g. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personal-
ity Inventory, MMPI) are based on norm-referenced
self-report, and therefore depend on patients’ will-
ingness and ability to report symptoms. However,
some individuals are motivated to underreport symp-
toms to avoid negative consequences (e.g. active
duty soldiers, parents undergoing child custody eval-
uations), and others lack the self awareness to report
accurately.1 Second, many people – e.g. those with-
1As evidenced by the fact that assessments such as the MMPI-2-
RF include validity scales to detect, e.g., defensiveness, atyp-
out adequate insurance or in rural areas – cannot ac-
cess a clinician qualified to perform a psychological
evaluation (Sibelius, 2013; APA, 2013). There is
enormous value in inexpensive screening measures
that could be administered in primary care and by
social workers and other providers.
We take as a starting point the well known
lexicon-driven methods of Pennebaker and col-
leagues (LIWC, Pennebaker and King (1999)),
which relate language use to psychological vari-
ables, and improve on them straightforwardly using
topic modeling (LDA, Blei et al. (2003)). First, we
show that taking automatically derived topics into
account improves prediction of neuroticism (emo-
tional instability, John and Srivastava (1999)), as
measured by correlation with widely used clinical
instruments, when compared with lexically-based
prediction alone. Neuroticism is of particular inter-
est as a personality measure because higher scores
on neuroticism scales are consistent with increased
distress and more difficulty coping; individuals with
high levels of neuroticism may also be at higher risk
of psychiatric problems categorized as Axis I in the
DSM-IV (Association, 2000), including the inter-
nalizing disorders (depression, anxiety).2 Second,
we show a similar correlation improvement result
for prediction of depression, adding improvement
ical responses, and overly positive self-portrayals (Tellegen et
al., 2003).
2The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is a
widely used organization of mental health conditions; it served
as the standard for diagnosis from 1994 until the release of
the (quite controversial) DSM-5 in May, 2013. Axis I in the
DSM-IV includes all the major diagnostic categories, exclud-
ing mental retardation and personality disorders.

on precision (with no decrease in recall), as well
as comparison with human performance by clinical
psychologists. Third, we show that LDA has iden-
tified meaningful, population-specific themes that
go beyond the pre-defined LIWC categories and are
psychologically relevant.
2 Predicting neuroticism
2.1 Experimental framework
Data. We utilize a collection of 6,459 stream-of-
consciousness essays collected from college stu-
dents by Pennebaker and King (1999) between 1997
and 2008, averaging approximately 780 words each.
Students were asked to think about their thoughts,
sensations, and feelings in the moment and “write
your thoughts as they come to you”.
Each essay is accompanied by metadata for its
author, which includes scores for the Big-5 person-
ality traits (John and Srivastava, 1999): agreeable-
ness, conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism,
and openness. Because Big-5 assessment can be
done using a variety of different survey instruments
(John et al., 2008), and different instruments were
used from year to year, we treat the data from each
year as an independent dataset.
Any author missing any Big-5 attribute was ex-
cluded. Essays were tokenized using NLTK (Bird
et al., 2009) and lowercased, eliminating those that
failed tokenization because of encoding issues. This
resulted in a dataset containing 4,777 essays with as-
sociated Big-5 metadata.
LIWC features. For each document, we calcu-
late the number of observed words in each of Pen-
nebaker and King’s 64 LIWC categories. These in-
clude, among others, syntactic categories (e.g. pro-
nouns, verbs), affect categories (e.g. negative emo-
tion words, anger words), semantic categories (e.g.
causation words, cognitive words), and topical cat-
egories (e.g. health, religion). For instance, the
anger category contains 190 word patterns specify-
ing, for example, words descriptive of contexts in-
volving anger (e.g. brutal, hostile, shoot) and words
that would be used by someone when angry (e.g.
bullshit, hate, moron). We also explored includ-
ing essays’ average sentence length and total word-
count, as an initial proxy for language complexity,
which often figures into psychological assessments.
However, results adding these features to LIWC did
not differ significantly from LIWC alone, and for
brevity we do not report them.3
LDA features. We use vanilla LDA as imple-
mented in the Mallet toolkit (McCallum, 2002), de-
veloping a k-topic model on just training documents,
and using the posterior topic distribution for each
training and test document as a set of k features.
Mallet’s stoplist and default parameters were used
for burn-in, lag, number of iterations, priors, etc.
Details on train/test splits and number k of topics
appear below.
LIWC+LDA features. The union of the LIWC
features (one feature per category) and LDA features
(one feature per topic).
Prediction. We utilize linear regression in the
WEKA toolkit (Hall et al., 2009), estimated on train-
ing documents, to predict the neuroticism score as-
sociated with the author of each test document.4
2.2 Results
Table 1 shows the quality of prediction via linear
regression, averaged over the eleven datasets, 1997
through 2008, using Pearson correlation (r) as the
evaluation metric. For each year, we used 10-fold
cross-validation to ensure proper separation of train-
ing and test data. We experimented with LDA us-
ing 20, 30, 40, and 50 topics.5
A first thing to observe is that the multiple re-
gressions using all LIWC categories produce much
stronger correlations with neuroticism than the indi-
vidual category correlations reported by Pennebaker
and King.6 There the strongest individual corre-
lations with neuroticism for any LIWC categories
are .16 (negative emotion words) and -.13 (positive
emotion words), though it should be noted that their
goal was to validate their categories as a meaningful
3Using richer measures of complexity, e.g. Pakhomov et al.
(2011), is a topic for future work.
4In previous work we have found that multiple linear regression
is competitive with more complicated techniques such as SVM
regression, though we plan to explore the latter in future work.

als at http://umiacs.umd.edu/˜resnik/papers/

6The comparison is not perfect, since they used Big-5 data col-
lected between 1993 and 1998, and we also eliminated some
files during preprocessing.

As noted in Table 1, paired t-tests (df=10, ? =

erages, augmenting LIWC with topic features im-
proves average correlation significantly over using
LIWC features alone for 30, 40, and 50 topics.
LDA features alone do not improve significantly
over LIWC.
3 Predicting Depression
3.1 Experimental framework
Data. We use essays collected by Rude et al.
(2004) similarly to §2.1; in this case, students were
asked to “describe your deepest thoughts and feel-
ings about being in college”. Each essay is accom-
panied by the author’s Beck Depression Inventory
score (BDI). BDI (Beck et al., 1961) is a widely
used 21-question instrument that correlates strongly
with ratings of depression by psychiatrists. Follow-
ing Rude et al., we treat BDI ? 14 as the threshold
for a positive instance of depression.7 Text prepro-
cessing was done as in §2.1, with 124 documents in
total averaging around 390 words each.
Training/test split. Because only 12 of 124 au-
thors met the BDI ? 14 threshold, we did not split
randomly, lest the test sample include too few pos-
itive instances to be useful. Instead we included a
random 6 of the 12 above-threshold cases, plus 24
more items sampled at random, to create a 30-item
test set. To form the training set from the comple-
mentary items, we added two more copies of each
positive instance to help address class imbalance
(Batista et al., 2004) and, following Rude et al., we
excluded items with with BDI of 0 or 1 as potentially
invalid.
Human comparison. We created a set of expert
human results for comparison by asking three prac-
ticing clinical psychologists to review the test doc-
uments and rate whether or not the author is suffer-
7Each question contributes a score value from 0 to 3, so BDI
scores range from 0 to 63.
ing depression.8 They were asked to “decide how
at-risk this person might be for depression”, assign-
ing 0 (no significant concerns), 1 (mild concerns, but
does not require futher evaluation), or 2 (requires at-
tention, refer for further evaluation). Following rec-
ommended practice for cases where different labels
are not equally distinct from each other (Artstein
and Poesio, 2008), we evaluate inter-coder agree-
ment using Krippendorff’s ?; our ?, computed for
ordinal data, is 0.722.
Features. We ran 50-topic LDA on the 4,777 es-
says from §2.1 plus the BDI training items, using the
posterior topic distributions as features as in §2.1.
As in §2.1, the LIWC features comprised one count
per LIWC category, and LIWC+LDA features were
the union of the two.
3.2 Results
Regression on LIWC features alone achieved r =
.288, and adding topic features improved this sub-
stantially to r = .416. Treating BDI ? 14 as the
threshold for positive instances (i.e. that an author is
depressed), Table 2 shows that adding topic features
improves precision without harming recall. Auto-
matic prediction is more conservative than human
ratings, trading recall for precision to achieve com-
parable F-measure on this test set.9
8These psychologists all have doctoral degrees, are licensed,
and spend significant time primarily in assessment and diag-
nosis of psychological disorders. None were familiar with the
specifics of this study.
9A reviewer observes, correctly, that in a scenario where a sys-
tem is providing preliminary screenings to aid psychologists,
the precision/recall tradeoff demonstrated here would poten-
tially be undesirable, since a presumed goal would be to not
miss any cases, even at the risk of some false positives. We
note, however, that the real world is unfortunately replete with
situations where there is significant cost or social/professional
stigma associated with interventions or follow-up testing; in
such situations it might be high precision that is desirable.
These are challenging questions, and the ability to trade off
precision versus recall more flexibly is a topic we are inter-
ested in investigating in future work.

4 Qualitative themes
In order to explore the relevance of the themes
uncovered by LDA, the third author, a practicing
clinical psychologist, reviewed the 50 LDA cate-
gories created in §3.1. Each category, represented
by its 20 highest-probability words, was given a
readable description. Then, for each category, she
was asked: “If you were conducting a clinical in-
terview, would observing these themes in a patient’s
responses make you more (less) likely to feel that the
patient merited further evaluation for depression?”
Table 3 shows the seven topics selected as par-
ticularly indicative of further evaluation.10 These
capture population-specific properties in ways that
LIWC cannot — for example, although LIWC does
have a body category, it does not have a category
that corresponds to somatic complaints, which often
co-occur with depression. Similarly, some words re-
lated to energy level, e.g. tired, would be captured
in LIWC’s body, bio, and/or health category, but
the LDA theme corresponding to low energy or lack
of sleep, another potential depression cue, contains
words that make sense there only in context (e.g. to-
morrow, late). Other themes, such as the one labeled
HOMESICKNESS, are clearly relevant (potentially in-
dicative of an adjustment disorder), but even more
specific to the population and context.
5 Related Work
The application of NLP to psychological variables
has seen a recent uptick in community activity. One
recent shared task brings together research on the
Big-5 personality traits (Celli et al., 2013; Kosin-
ski et al., 2013), and another involved research on
identification of emotion in suicide notes (Pestian et
al., 2012). Other examples include NLP research on

autistic spectrum disorders (Van Santen et al., 2010;
Prudhommeaux et al., 2011; Lehr et al., 2013) and
dementia (Pakhomov et al., 2011; Lehr et al., 2012;
Roark et al., 2011).
With regard to depression, Neuman et al. (2012)
develop a corpus-based “depression lexicon” and
produce promising screening results, and De Choud-
hury et al. (2013) predict social network behav-
ior changes related to post-partum depression. Nei-
ther, however, evaluates using formal instruments
for clinical assessment.
Related investigations involving LDA include
Zhai et al. (2012), who use LIWC to provide pri-
ors for corpus-specific emotion categories; Stark et
al. (2012), who combine LIWC and LDA-based
features in classification of social relationships; and
Schwartz et al. (2013), who use lexical and topic-
based features in Twitter to predict life satisfaction.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have aimed for a small, fo-
cused contribution, investigating the value-add of
topic modeling in text analysis for depression, and
for neuroticism as a strongly associated personal-
ity measure. Our contribution here is not techni-
cal: corpus-specific topics/themes are anticipated by
Zhai et al. (2012), and Stark et al. (2012) employ
topic-based features for prediction in a supervised
setting. Rather, our contribution here has been to
show that topic models can get us beyond the LIWC
categories to relevant, population-specific themes
related to neuroticism and depression, and to sup-
port that claim using evaluation against formal clin-
ical assessments. More data (e.g. Kosinski et al.
(2013)) and more sophisticated models (e.g. super-
vised LDA, Blei and McAuliffe (2008), and exten-
sions such as Nguyen et al. (2013)) will be the key
to further progress.
