Abstract 
The lexicons for Knowledge-Based Machine 
Translation systems require knowledge in- 
tensive morphological, syntactic and se- 
mantic information. This information is of- 
ten used in different ways and usually for- 
matted for a specific NLP system. This 
tends to make both the acquisition and 
maintenance of lexical databases cumber- 
some, inefficient and error-prone. In order 
to solve these problems, we have developed 
a program called COOL which automates 
the acquisition and maintenance processes 
and allows us to standardize and central- 
ize the databases. This system is currently 
being used in the ESTRATO machine trans- 
lation project at the Center for Machine 
Translation. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper, we describe a fully-implemented rule- 
based system for the semi-automatic a quisition 
and maintenance of lexical and semantic knowledge 
in a knowledge-based machine translation system. 
This rule-based system is called COOL: Creator Of 
ontologies and Lexicons. COOL can create and up- 
date various lexical and semantic knowledge sources 
for different NLP modules. 
COOL is a working system that was developed for 
ESTRATO (EScuela de TRAductores de TOledo), a 
joint project of the Center for Machine Translation 
at CMU and Union Electrica Fenosa, an electric util- 
ity company in Madrid, Spain. ESTRATO is a system 
*This project was funded by Union Electrica Fenosa, 
Madrid, Spain. 
for translating Spanish to English in a restricted o- 
main with controlled input. ESTRATO consists of sev- 
eral modules from the KANT MT system \[Mitamura 
et al., 1991\] as well as morphological nalysis and 
phrasal recognition modules and the TWS authoring 
environment\[Nirenburg et ai., 1992\]. 
As shown in figure 1, every ESTRATO run-time 
module uses a different lexical or semantic knowledge 
source, which differs in content as well as format. 
The knowledge contained in these modules overlaps. 
We needed to coordinate and maintain these know- 
ledge sources in a robust and efficient way. Further- 
more, the lexical information eeded by the trans- 
lator is initially acquired by people ("editors") who 
are neither linguists nor domain experts. This lex- 
ical information is kept in lexical feature files. 1 We 
needed away to convert hese lexical feature files into 
forms which could be used by the run-time modules 
of ESTRATO. 
Our solution is to maintain a centralized lexical 
and semantic frame database, and to use COOL to 
help us acquire this database by converting the ini~ 
tial feature files created by the human editors. The 
lexical and semantic knowledge sources needed by 
the run-time translator are then automatically gener- 
ated and maintained by COOL. Two subsystems per- 
form these tasks: ACQUISITION-COOL (A-COOL) and 
MAINTENANCE-COOL (M-COOL). A-COOL produces 
the central lexical and template semantic databases 
from the initial lexical feature files, which the linguist 
and domain expert can then modify. M-COOL goes 
beyond simple acquisition of lexical information. It 
automatically generates efficient run-time versions of 
the lexical and semantic knowledge from the central 
repository of lexical and semantic databases initially 
IWe do not describe the lexical acquisition program 
for acquiring the initial lexical feature files.

created by A-COOL and maintained by experts. The 
relationship between A-COOL, M-COOL and the three 
different types of information is depicted in figure 2. 
COOL maintains consistency in the knowledge 
sources and makes it easy to add lexical databases 
for new modules. By keeping a single source for all 
lexical information for a given language, COOL allows 
us to robustly maintain knowledge and eliminate re- 
dundancy, by using the power of a frame-based rule 
language. 
First we describe the acquisition and maintenance 
problems in more detail, and then describe the A- 
COOL and M-COOL tools which we developed to solve 
these problems. We also look at related efforts, and 
mention some ideas for future work. 
2 The Knowledge Acquisition and 
Maintenance Problems 
At the Center for Machine Translation, we use Lex- 
ical Functional Grammar (LFG) \[Kaplan Bresnan, 
1982\] as a basis for our syntactic grammars as well 
as our linking rules \[Levin, 1987\] for mapping syn- 
tactic functions to and from semantic roles. The lat- 
ter we refer to as "mapping rules". These mapping 
rules are used in conjunction with a domain model 
to build or generate from the interlingua text rep- 
resentations (ILT). The use of ILT is characteristic 
of the CMT approach to Knowledge-Based Machine 
Translation \[Goodman, 1991; Mitamura e~ al., 1991; 
Frederking et al., 1992\]. 
Given the emphasis placed on the lexicon in LFG 
in both syntax and semantics and the extensive do- 
main knowledge required for our translation system, 
we place a great deal of importance on the lexicon 
and finding easy methods to acquire, maintain, view, 
store and reuse the lexical information. COOL is a 
tool we are developing and using on the ESTRATO 
project for accomplishing these tasks. 
The knowledge acquisition and maintenance tasks 
can be rather cumbersome. Acquiring 1000's of new 
semantic oncepts and placing them into the top- 
level semantic hierarchy by hand is tedious and error- 
prone. This also applies to adding English and Span- 
ish words. Once the run-time knowledge sources for 
the various NLP modules have been acquired, main- 
taining consistency among the lexical and semantic 
files (phrasal-noun list, glossary, morpho-syntactic 
lexicons, word-to-concept mappings and the seman- 
tic concepts) is difficult. The NLP modules require 
different lexical and semantic knowledge with vary- 
ing formats. All modules hare some information 
which must be kept consistent, such as the part 
of speech and the word-sense. The concept name 
must be the same for the run-time semantic know- 
ledge source, the Spanish run-time lexical knowledge 
source, and the English run-time lexical knowledge 
source. Both acquiring the knowledge and maintain- 
ing consistency in the knowledge are prone to human 
error. 
One of the requirements of ESTRATO is that a non- 
linguist lexicographer be able to acquire and main- 
tain lexical information as much as possible. A-COOL 
allows the semi-automatic creation of NLP lexical 
knowledge from lexicographic nformation supplied 
by a non-linguist. 
At present, linguists must do some of the lexi- 
cal acquistion work such as providing semantic lass 
information and some specialized syntactic infor- 
mation for closed-class items, adjectives and verbs. 
When there is not always a one-to-one l xical map- 
ping from a Spanish and English word to the same 
concept \[Talmy, 1972; Talmy, 1985\], the lexical en- 
tries can only be produced semi-automatically. Lin- 
guists must also provide collocational information i

the lexicon relevant to lexical selection\[Mel'~uk et al., 
1984\]. 
3 Automated Knowledge Acquisition 
A-COOL automates the acquisition of lexical and se- 
mantic knowledge in ESTR.ATO. For each entry in 
a Spanish lexical feature file, A-COOL creates: a 
new semantic oncept frame for the central seman- 
tic database, a Spanish lexical frame for the Spanish 
central exical database and a skeletal entry for the 
English lexical feature file. Once the entry from the 
English lexical feature file has been filled out by the 
editor, A-COOL will also create a lexical frame for 
the English central lexical database. The word-to- 
concept mappings for the Spanish and English words 
are automatically created by A-COOL in order to en- 
sure consistency. A-COOL accomplishes all of this by 
means of easily modified if-then rules. 
When A-COOL creates a new concept, it automat- 
ically makes a link to a more general semantic lass. 
The top-level hierarchy we are currently using was 
created at Carnegie Mellon University \[Carlson and 
Nirenburg, 1990\]. The insertion of semantic oncepts 
into a hierarchy is not dependent on the specific top- 
level. The rules specify the linking of the new con- 
cepts in the semantic hierarchy based on features 
(such as ACTION for verbs and ANIMACY for nouns) in 
the lexical feature files. These rules can be modified 
easily for adding concepts to a different op-level. 
What follows is a description of the A-COOL pro- 
cess using the entry for the Spanish verb "funcionar" 
("to work"). The verb feature ACTION in the lexical 
acquisition phase is designed such that the user is 
(" FUSCIONAR" 
(cat v) (trans intrans) 
(action physical) 
(eng "function") 
(stem-change no) (comp-type O) 
.°°) 
("WORK" 
(cat v) (action physical) 
(span "funcionar") 
(comp-type 0) (trans intrans) 
. . . )  
Figure 3: Sample input verbs to A-COOL 
prompted for a response to a question about the type 
of action the verb represents (if any at all). With 
this information, A-COOL can produce the prelimi- 
nary value of IS-A for a semantic frame when it cre- 
ates the semantic frame from the verb entry. 
The "if" or "LHS" (left-hand-side) part of the 
A-COOL rules specifies properties of lexical features 
which must be true for the rule to apply. If the rule 
does apply, the "then" or "RHS" (right-hand-side) 
specifies which slots of the central database frame to 
create. 
For example, figure 3 shows entries for the Spanish 
verb "funcionar" and its corresponding English verb 
"work" from the lexical feature files. 
In order to convert these entries into central 
database frames, the following rules apply, rulel 
inserts the default information that the value of the 
CLASS feature for "funcionar" is AGENT, because the

reflexive value is unknown (see figure 4). It also in- 
serts the word into the lexical hierarchy under +W- 
SPANISH-INTRANS-VEItB and copies the TITANS infor- 
mation to the new frame. 
Similarly, ru le2 (see figure 5) helps to convert 
"work" by guessing at the value of the TITANS slot 
and setting the CLASS to AGENT-THEME. 
Finally, ru le3 (see figure 6) helps to generate the 
template semantic frame corresponding to the mean- 
ing of "funcionar" and "work" by placing the frame 
under PHYSICAL-EVENT in the semantic IS-A hierar- 
chy. 
A-COOL works by using the following algorithm: 
1. Read in the (Spanish or English) lexical feature 
file. 
2. For each lexical item, generate a frame by ap- 
plying all relevant rules to that lexical item. 
3. Write that frame to the central frame file. 
With "funcionar" and "work" as the input lexical 
items, the rules generate the central frames hown in 
figure 7.

databases). Thus, the lexical information is not 
spread out over several files and can be modified eas- 
ily. Each language's lexicon can also be organized 
hierarchically. 
Using a set of if-then rules, M-COOL automatically 
produces the necessary run-time lexical and seman- 
tic knowledge sources for the various NLP modules. 
These rules specify which features are needed for the 
different modules. The rules also create some lexical 
knowledge that can be extracted from the lexical and 
semantic hierarchies. This information eed not be 
specified in the lexical entries.2 
Since the various run-time lexical and semantic 
knowledge sources now come from common central 
databases, consistency is maintained and human er- 
ror is minimized. Both the semantic knowledge and 
the lexical knowledge are stored in a standard frame- 
based format. This allows the linguist and domain- 
expert o view or modify the knowledge with a frame- 
based editor. 
The rest of this section describes the M-COOL pro- 
gram, the lexical and semantic frames used by M- 
COOL, and then gives an annoted example to illus- 
trate how M-COOL works. 
4.2 P rogram Descr ipt ion  
In order to make the knowledge maintenance cycle 
fazter, M-COOL can also work incrementally as well 
as in batch mode. If the linguist only modifies or 
~E.g., the linking of syntactic arguments o semantic 
roles. 
152 
adds a small number of lexical or semantic items, 
the incremental version of M-COOL will only update 
the run-time knowledge sources which are affected 
by the changes, instead of re-generating all of the 
run-time knowledge sources. This saves considerable 
time over the non-incremental method. 
M-COOL works by first determining which run-time 
knowledge sources need to be updated. For each such 
knowledge source, it then applies all rules which are 
relevant o that knowledge source. Each rule is as- 
sociated with a specific knowledge source. 
To extend M-COOL to generate the run-time know- 
ledge source for a new NLP module, two steps are 
taken: 
1. Define the properties of the new knowledge 
source in the file-type table. 
2. Write a new set of rules for generating the en- 
tries which comprise the new knowledge source. 
These rules specify the lexical features to be 
used for the entry as well as the format of the 
entry. 
The file-type table simply tells M-COOL whether 
the given knowledge source is lexical or semantic, 
and whether it is for generation or analysis. It 
also supplies miscellaneous information such as the 
name of the file where the run-time entries are kept 
and whether it can be compiled using the LISP 
compile command. For example, our Spanish- 
lexical-analysis file-type is defined with this entry: 
DATABASE Spanish-lexical-analys is 
"Spanish/Mappings/lex-map. lisp" 
:lexical :analysis 
The rule language used by M-COOL is called 
FRULEKIT \[Shell and Carbonell, 1986\]. FRULEKIT is 
an efficient CommonLisp attern matcher with sev- 
eral extensions over oPs-5. The most relevant exten- 
sion is that it allows rules to flexibly match against 
and modify frames in a hierarchy. Having such a 
frame-based rule language makes it easy for us to 
write rules to update the ESTRATO runtime know- 
ledge sources. 
4.3 Lexical and  Semant ic  k'Yame 
Descr ipt ion 
Let us briefly discuss the lexical and semantic 
database files which are the input to M-COOL. The 
lexical frames are the repository of all lexical know- 
ledge for the ESTRATO system. These frames contain 
structural, grammatical nd some semantic encod- 
ing information for words or phrases. They can be 
easily extended to include other lexical information 
(e.g., definitions or synonyms) for display to a hu- 
man translator. For the purposes of ESTRATO, each 
lexical entry contains a part of speech (CAT), a lex- 
ical mapping rule (HEAD or SEM-MAP), a root form 
(ROOT) and a link (IS-A) to its location in the lex- 
ical hierarchy. Nouns (CAT N) contain agreement

(GENDER and NUMBER) count/mass (COUNT) and 
a trinary distinction of ANIMACY (human, animal, 
non-living). Morphological information for Span- 
ish is represented in the feature STEM-CHANGE and 
for both Spanish and English in the features ALLO- 
FLAG and IRREGULARS. Verbs and adjectives contain 
features for subcategorization (TRANS, COMP-TYPE) 
and features for syntactic-semantic argument link- 
ing (CLASS, MAPPINGS). CLASS here refers to the 
type of linking rules a verb or adjective \[Levin and 
Rappaport, 1987\] will use for its syntactic arguments 
(SUBJ, OBJ, OBJ2, XCOMP, and COMP \[Kaplan Bres- 
nan, 1982l). Semantic knowledge about the world 
is stored in a domain model organized in an is-a 
hierarchy using frames that correspond to the var- 
ious events (PHYSICAL-EVENT *ASSEMBLE-MONTAR) 
and objects (PHYSICAL-OBJECT *TRANSFORMER- 
TRANSFORMADOR), relations (AGENT, THEME) 3 be- 
tween these objects and events and properties 
(COLOR, SHAPE) in the specific domain\[Carlson a d 
Nirenburg, 1990\]. The name of each lexical frame 
represents a single word sense \[Meyer et al., 1992\]. 
Examples of lexical frames are shown in figure 7. 
Each frame specifies a link to a parent in the lexi- 
cal hierarchy or the domain model hierarchy (IS-A). 
This allows lexical entries to be arranged into classes 
which require similar "mapping rules" \[Mitamura, 
1989\]. 
Each semantic knowledge database frame in the 
domain model also specifies the roles which a given 
concept may have as well as specific restrictions on 
the fillers of those roles. An example of a semantic 
frame was shown in figure 7. The information in the 
databases i  used in different forms and combinations 
depending on the NLP component's needs. 
Figure 8 shows a frame which is an alterna- 
tive English lexical entry for the concept *WORK- 
FUNCIONAR. 
3We make no theoretical claims about the defini- 
tion of the roles agent and theme \[Guerssel t el., 1985; 
Jackendoff, 1983\].

4.4 Example 
Now we will illustrate how M-COOL rules auto- 
matically generate various types of run-time know- 
ledge from the frames shown in figure 7. Figure 9 
shows a rule for generating lexical mapping informa- 
tion. This rule applies to the lexical frame Tw-sP- 
FUNCIONAR-V-2 in order to generate the run-time 
lexical analysis mapping data depicted in figure 10. 
Next we have a rule for generating the run-time 
Ontology database, which we call "framettes" (fig- 
ure 11). This rule applies to the semantic frame 
*WORK-FUNCIONAR (shown in figure 7) to generate 
the framette as shown in figure 12. 
The two previous rules were fairly simple, but M- 
COOL can perform much more complex computa- 
tions. For example, in order to generate fficient run- 
time knowledge which allows the translator to map 
from interlingua into English feature-structures, M- 
COOL must find, for each semantic frame, every En- 
glish lexical frame which corresponds to it. It then 
combines this correspondence information into a sin- 
gle LISP function which will efficiently perform the 
mapping at run-time. One of the M-COOL rules re- 
sponsible for constructing this knowledge is shown 
in figure 13. In this example, it applies to the se- 
mantic frame *WORK-FUNCIONAR.. It finds two lex-

5 Re la ted  Work  
Most of the effort in developing software tools for 
NLP has focused on user interfaces and acquisition 
of lexical databases from text corpora, but there are 
very few rule-based systems for knowledge mainte- 
nance. \[Pin-Ngern et al., 1989\] go beyond corpus 
analysis by augmenting the lexicM databases with 
knowledge supplied by human editors. The Word 
Manager \[Domenig, 1988\] is a system for both acqui- 
sition and maintenance of morphological knowledge, 
but its main strength is its user-interface. LUKE 
\[Knight, 1991\] is an interactive system which uses 
several heuristics exploiting the relationship between 
linguistic and world knowledge to partially automate 
the acquisition process. 
More effort has gone into the acquisition and main- 
tenance of knowledge for expert-systems. 4 The fo- 
cus of such efforts is to acquire smaller amounts of 
problem-solving knowledge, which is more complex 
than the semantic and lexicM knowledge used in ES- 
TRATO. 
6 Future  Work  
We intend to extend COOL in three directions: by 
supporting the acquisition and maintenance of lexi- 
cal and semantic information for new languages, by 
adding rules for completely automating the acquis- 
tion of semantic lasses and lexical argument alter- 
nations \[Bresnan, 1982; Perlmutter, 1983\], and by

improving the functionality of the underlying system 
itself. Because it is easy to extend M-COOL to gen- 
erate run-time knowledge sources for new modules, 
we plan to add, for example: English-analysis lexical 
tables, Spanish-generation lexical tables, and lexical 
tables for an external machine-translation system. 
We also have plans for integrating the various 
acquisition and maintenance tools we use in the 
ESTRATO system (which include A-COOL and M- 
COOL) into a single incremental lexical acquisition 
and maintenance program with a user-friendly in- 
terface for both experts and non-experts. The in- 
terface will prompt the non-expert for information 
about a word without the user needing to know lin- 
guistics. For example, determining the countablilty 
of a noun can be done by prompting the user with 
examples of the word being used in a countable con- 
text and non-countable context. This will allow 
non-experts to add most of the lexical and seman- 
tic knowledge. Currently the process of adding or 
modifying database ntries and running A-COOL and 
M-COOL requires the user to understand both the in- 
ternM representation of the lexical items and how 
to run the various programs. An interactive know- 
ledge editor which hides all of the details from the 
user will make the user's work much more productive 
and simple. 
7 Conc lus ions  
Our idea of developing a program to help automate 
the task of lexical and semantic knowledge acquisi- 
tion and maintenance has been very fruitful for us. 
We have realized the following benefits: 
 A-COOL and M-COOL make knowledge acquisi- 
tion and maintenance asier, faster and more 
robust. By automatically generating template 
lexical and semantic database ntries from the 
lexical feature files, A-COOL accelerates the ac- 
quisition process and eliminates many sources of 
human error. Similarly, M-COOL eliminates the 
need to manually update a large number of run- 
time knowledge sources each time a new lexical 
entry is added. By using a powerful and efficient 
frame-matching rule-based system to automat- 
ically generate the correct run-time knowledge 
sources, knowledge-maintenance is faster. 
 M-COOL allows us to integrate generation and 
analysis lexical knowledge. Because M-COOL 
can generate both analysis and generation lex- 
ical knowledge sources from the same central 
database, this makes it very easy to create Span- 
ish generation and English analysis knowledge 
sources. This solves the problem of having to 
maintain separate versions of knowledge for the 
analysis and generation of the same language. 
 It is easy to extend M-COOL to new modules. 
Although we didn't anticipate it, we were able 
to use M-COOL to generate and maintain a wide 
155 
variety of additional knowledge sources (for ex- 
ample, a custom glossary and a phrasal-lexicon
