Abstract
Discourse structure is the hidden link be-
tween surface features and document-level
properties, such as sentiment polarity. We
show that the discourse analyses produced
by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)
parsers can improve document-level senti-
ment analysis, via composition of local in-
formation up the discourse tree. First, we
show that reweighting discourse units ac-
cording to their position in a dependency
representation of the rhetorical structure
can yield substantial improvements on
lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Next,
we present a recursive neural network
over the RST structure, which offers sig-
nificant improvements over classification-
based methods.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are among
the most widely-used applications of language
technology, impacting both industry and a vari-
ety of other academic disciplines (Feldman, 2013;
Liu, 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). Yet senti-
ment analysis is still dominated by bag-of-words
approaches, and attempts to include additional
linguistic context typically stop at the sentence
level (Socher et al., 2013). Since document-level
opinion mining inherently involves multi-sentence
texts, it seems that analysis of document-level
structure should have a role to play.
A classic example of the potential relevance of
discourse to sentiment analysis is shown in Fig-
ure 1. In this review of the film The Last Samu-
rai, the positive sentiment words far outnumber
the

clearly favors the final sentence, whose polarity
is negative. This example is illustrative in more
than one way: it was originally identified by Voll
and Taboada (2007), who found that manually-
annotated RST parse trees improved lexicon-
based sentiment analysis, but that automatically-
generated parses from the SPADE parser (Soricut
and Marcu, 2003), which was then state-of-the-art,
did not.
Since this time, RST discourse parsing has im-
proved considerably, with the best systems now
yielding 5-10% greater raw accuracy than SPADE,
depending on the metric. The time is therefore
right to reconsider the effectiveness of RST for
document-level sentiment analysis. In this pa-
per, we present two different ways of combin-
ing RST discourse parses with sentiment analy-
sis. The methods are both relatively simple, and
2212
can be used in combination with an “off the shelf”
discourse parser. We consider the following two
architectures:
• Reweighting the contribution of each dis-
course unit, based on its position in a
dependency-like representation of the dis-
course structure. Such weights can be de-
fined using a simple function, or learned from
a small of data.
• Recursively propagating sentiment up
through the RST parse, in an architecture in-
spired by recursive neural networks (Smolen-
sky, 1990; Socher et al., 2011).
Both architectures can be used in combination
with either a lexicon-based sentiment analyzer, or
a trained classifier. Indeed, for users whose start-
ing point is a lexicon-based approach, a simple
RST-based reweighting function can offer signif-
icant improvements. For those who are willing
to train a sentiment classifier, the recursive model
yields further gains.
2 Background
2.1 Rhetorical Structure Theory
RST is a compositional model of discourse struc-
ture, in which elementary discourse units (EDUs)
are combined intro progressively larger discourse
units, ultimately covering the entire document.
Discourse relations may involve a nucleus and a
satellite, or they may be multinuclear. In the ex-
ample in Figure 1, the unit 1C is the satellite of
a relationship with its nucleus 1B; together they
form a larger discourse unit, which is involved in
a multinuclear CONJUNCTION relation.
The nuclearity structure of RST trees suggests
a natural approach to evaluating the importance
of segments of text: satellites tend to be less
important, and nucleii tend to be more impor-
tant (Marcu, 1999). This idea has been leveraged
extensively in document summarization (Gerani
et al., 2014; Uzˆeda et al., 2010; Yoshida et
al., 2014), and was the inspiration for Voll and
Taboada (2007), who examined intra-sentential re-
lations, eliminating all words except those in the
top-most nucleus within each sentence. More re-
cent work focuses on reweighting each discourse
unit depending on the relations in which it partic-
ipates (Heerschop et al., 2011; Hogenboom et al.,
2015). We consider such an approach, and com-
pare it with a compositional method, in which sen-
timent polarity is propagated up the discourse tree.
Marcu (1997) provides the seminal work on
automatic RST parsing, but there has been a re-
cent spike of interest in this task, with contempo-
rary approaches employing discriminative learn-
ing (Hernault et al., 2010), rich features (Feng
and Hirst, 2012), structured prediction (Joty et al.,
2015), and representation learning (Ji and Eisen-
stein, 2014; Li et al., 2014). With many strong
systems to choose from, we employ the publicly-
available DPLP parser (Ji and Eisenstein, 2014),
1
.
To our knowledge, this system currently gives the
best F-measure on relation identification, the most
difficult subtask of RST parsing. DPLP is a shift-
reduce parser (Sagae, 2009), and its time complex-
ity is linear in the length of the document.
2.2 Sentiment analysis
There is a huge literature on sentiment analy-
sis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012), with partic-
ular interest in determining the overall sentiment
polarity (positive or negative) of a document. Bag-
of-words models are widely used for this task, as
they offer accuracy that is often very competitive
with more complex approaches. Given labeled
data, supervised learning can be applied to obtain
sentiment weights for each word. However, the
effectiveness of supervised sentiment analysis de-
pends on having training data in the same domain
as the target, and this is not always possible. More-
over, in social science applications, the desired
labels may not correspond directly to positive or
negative sentiment, but may focus on other cat-
egories, such as politeness (Danescu-Niculescu-
Mizil et al., 2013), narrative frames (Jurafsky et
al., 2014), or a multidimensional spectrum of emo-
tions (Kim et al., 2012). In these cases, labeled
documents may not be available, so users of-
ten employ a simpler method: counting matches
against lists of words associated with each cate-
gory. Such lists may be built manually from intro-
spection, as in LIWC (Tausczik and Pennebaker,
2010) and the General Inquirer (Stone, 1966). Al-
ternatively, they may be induced by bootstrapping
from a seed set of words (Hatzivassiloglou and
McKeown, 1997; Taboada et al., 2011). While
lexicon-based methods may be less accurate than
supervised classifiers, they are easier to apply to

Figure 2: Dependency-based discourse tree repre-
sentation of the discourse in Figure 1
new domains and problem settings. Our proposed
approach can be used in combination with either
method for sentiment analysis, and in principle,
could be directly applied to other document-level
categories, such as politeness.
2.3 Datasets
We evaluate on two review datasets. In both cases,
the goal is to correctly classify the opinion po-
larity as positive or negative. The first dataset
is comprised of 2000 movie reviews, gathered by
Pang and Lee (2004). We perform ten-fold cross-
validation on this data. The second dataset is
larger, consisting of 50,000 movie reviews, gath-
ered by Socher et al. (2013), with a predefined
50/50 split into training and test sets. Documents
are scored on a 1-10 scale, and we treat scores
? 4 as negative,? 7 as positive, and ignore scores
of 5-6 as neutral — although in principle nothing
prevents extension of our approaches to more than
two sentiment classes.
3 Discourse depth reweighting
Our first approach to incorporating discourse in-
formation into sentiment analysis is based on
quantifying the importance of each unit of text in
terms of its discourse depth. To do this, we em-
ploy the dependency-based discourse tree (DEP-
DT) formulation from prior work on summariza-
tion (Hirao et al., 2013). The DEP-DT formal-
ism converts the constituent-like RST tree into
a directed graph over elementary discourse units
(EDUs), in a process that is a close analogue of the
transformation of a headed syntactic constituent
parse to a syntactic dependency graph (K¨ubler et
al., 2009).
The DEP-DT representation of the discourse in
Figure 1 in shown in Figure 2. The graph is con-
structed by propagating “head” information up the
RST tree; if the elementary discourse unit e
i
is the
satellite in a discourse relation headed by e
j
, then
there is an edge from e
j
to e
i
. Thus, the “depth”
of each EDU is the number of times in which it is
embedded in the satellite of a discourse relation.
The exact algorithm for constructing DEP-DTs is
given by Hirao et al. (2013).
Given this representation, we construct a simple
linear function for weighting the contribution of
the EDU at depth d
i
:
?
i
= max(0.5, 1? d
i
/6). (1)
Thus, at d
i
= 0, we have ?
i
= 1, and at d
i
? 3, we
have ?
i
= 0.5. Now assume each elementary dis-
course unit contributes a prediction ?
i
= ?
>
w
i
,
where w
i
is the bag-of-words vector, and ? is a
vector of weights, which may be either learned or
specified by a sentiment lexicon. Then the overall
prediction for a document is given by,
? =
?
i
?
i
(?
>
w
i
) = ?
>
(
?
i
?
i
w
i
). (2)
Evaluation We apply this approach in combi-
nation with both lexicon-based and classification-
based sentiment analysis. We use the lexicon of
Wilson et al. (2005), and set ?
j
= 1 for words
marked “positive”, and ?
j
= ?1 for words marked
negative. For classification-based analysis, we set
? equal to the weights obtained by training a logis-
tic regression classifier, tuning the regularization
coefficient on held-out data.
Results are shown in Table 1. As seen in
the comparison between lines B1 and D1, dis-
course depth weighting offers substantial improve-
ments over the bag-of-words approach for lexicon-
based sentiment analysis, with raw improvements
of 4?5%. Given the simplicity of this approach —
which requires only a sentiment lexicon and a dis-
course parser — we strongly recommend the ap-
plication of discourse depth weighting for lexicon-
based sentiment analysis at the document level.
However, the improvements for the classification-
based models are considerably smaller, less than
1% in both datasets.
4 Rhetorical Recursive Neural Networks
Discourse-depth reweighting offers significant im-
provements for lexicon-based sentiment analy-
sis, but the improvements over the more accurate
classification-based method are meager. We there-
fore turn to a data-driven approach for combining
sentiment analysis with rhetorical structure theory,
based on recursive neural networks (Socher et al.,
2214

Table 1: Sentiment classification accuracies on
two movie review datasets (Pang and Lee, 2004;
Socher et al., 2013), described in Section 2.3.
2011). The idea is simple: recursively propagate
sentiment scores up the RST tree, until the root of
the document is reached. For nucleus-satellite dis-
course relations, we have:
?
i
= tanh(K
(r
i
)
n
?
n(i)
+K
(r
i
)
s
?
s(i)
), (3)
where i indexes a discourse unit composed from
relation r
i
, n(i) indicates its nucleus, and s(i) in-
dicates its satellite. Returning to the example in
Figure 1, the sentiment score for the discourse unit
obtained by combining 1B and 1C is obtained
from tanh(K
(elaboration)
n
?
1B
+ K
(elaboration)
s
?
1C
).
Similarly, for multinuclear relations, we have,
?
i
= tanh(
?
j?n(i)
K
(r
i
)
n
?
j
). (4)
In the base case, each elementary discourse unit’s
sentiment is constructed from its bag-of-words,
?
i
= ?
>
w
i
. Because the structure of each doc-
ument is different, the network architecture varies
in each example; nonetheless, the parameters can
be reused across all instances.
This approach, which we call a Rhetorical Re-
cursive Neural Network (R2N2), is reminiscent of
the compositional model proposed by Socher et al.
(2013), where composition is over the constituents
of the syntactic parse of a sentence, rather than
the units of a discourse. However, a crucial differ-
ence is that in R2N2s, the elements ? and K are
scalars: we do not attempt to learn a latent dis-
tributed representation of the sub-document units.
This is because discourse units typically comprise
multiple words, so that accurate analysis of the
sentiment for elementary discourse units is not so
difficult as accurate analysis of individual words.
The scores for individual discourse units can be
computed from a bag-of-words classifier, or, in fu-
ture work, from a more complex model such as a
recursive or recurrent neural network.
While this neural network structure captures
the idea of compositionality over the RST tree,
the most deeply embedded discourse units can be
heavily down-weighted by the recursive compo-
sition (assuming K
s
< K
n
): in the most ex-
treme case of a right-branching or left-branching
structure, the recursive operator may be appliedN
times to the most deeply embedded EDU. In con-
trast, discourse depth reweighting applies a uni-
form weight of 0.5 to all discourse units with depth
? 3. In the spirit of this approach, we add an addi-
tional component to the network architecture, cap-
turing the bag-of-words for the entire document.
Thus, at the root node we have:
?
doc
= ??
>
(
?
i
w
i
) + ?
rst-root
, (5)
with ?
rst-root
defined recursively from Equations 3
and 4, ? indicating the vector of per-word weights,
and the scalar ? controlling the tradeoff between
these two components.
Learning R2N2 is trained by backpropagating
from a hinge loss objective; assuming y
t
?
{?1, 1} for each document t, we have the loss
L
t
= (1 ? y
t
?
doc,t
)
+
. From this loss, we
use backpropagation through structure to obtain
gradients on the parameters (Goller and Kuch-
ler, 1996). Training is performed using stochas-
tic gradient descent. For simplicity, we fol-
low Zirn et al. (2011) and focus on the dis-
tinction between contrastive and non-contrastive
relations. The set of contrastive relations in-
cludes CONTRAST, COMPARISON, ANTITHE-
SIS, ANTITHESIS-E, CONSEQUENCE-S, CON-
CESSION, and PROBLEM-SOLUTION.
Evaluation Results for this approach are shown
in lines R1 and R2 of Table 1. Even without dis-
tinguishing between discourse relations, we get an
improvement of more than 3% accuracy on the
Stanford data, and 0.5% on the smaller Pang &
Lee dataset. Adding sensitivity to discourse rela-
tions (distinguishingK
(r)
for contrastive and non-
contrastive relations) offers further improvements
on the Pang & Lee data, outperforming the base-
line classifier (D2) by 1.3%.
The accuracy of discourse relation detection is
only 60% for even the best systems (Ji and Eisen-
2215
stein, 2014), which may help to explain why re-
lations do not offer a more substantial boost. An
anonymous reviewer recommended evaluating on
gold RST parse trees to determine the extent to
which improvements in RST parsing might trans-
fer to downstream document analysis. Such an
evaluation would seem to require a large corpus of
texts with both gold RST parse trees and sentiment
polarity labels; the SFU Review Corpus (Taboada,
2008) of 30 review texts offers a starting point, but
is probably too small to train a competitive senti-
ment analysis system.
5 Related Work
Section 2 mentions some especially relevant prior
work. Other efforts to incorporate RST into
sentiment analysis have often focused on intra-
sentential discourse relations (Heerschop et al.,
2011; Zhou et al., 2011; Chenlo et al., 2014),
rather than relations over the entire document.
Wang et al. (2012) address sentiment analysis in
Chinese. Lacking a discourse parser, they focus
on explicit connectives, using a strategy that is re-
lated to our discourse depth reweighting. Wang
and Wu (2013) use manually-annotated discourse
parses in combination with a sentiment lexicon,
which is automatically updated based on the dis-
course structure. Zirn et al. (2011) use an RST
parser in a Markov Logic Network, with the goal
of making polarity predictions at the sub-sentence
level, rather than improving document-level pre-
diction. None of the prior work considers the sort
of recurrent compositional model presented here.
An alternative to RST is to incorporate “shal-
low” discourse structure, such as the relations
from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB).
PDTB relations were shown to improve sentence-
level sentiment analysis by Somasundaran et al.
(2009), and were incorporated in a model of sen-
timent flow by Wachsmuth et al. (2014). PDTB
relations are often signaled with explicit discourse
connectives, and these may be used as a fea-
ture (Trivedi and Eisenstein, 2013; Lazaridou et
al., 2013) or as posterior constraints (Yang and
Cardie, 2014). This prior work on discourse rela-
tions within sentences and between adjacent sen-
tences can be viewed as complementary to our fo-
cus on higher-level discourse relations across the
entire document.
There are unfortunately few possibilities for
direct comparison of our approach against prior
work. Heerschop et al. (2011) and Wachsmuth et
al. (2014) also employ the Pang and Lee (2004)
dataset, but neither of their results are directly
comparable: Heerschop et al. (2011) exclude doc-
uments that SPADE fails to parse, and Wachsmuth
et al. (2014) evaluates only on individual sentences
rather than entire documents. The only possi-
ble direct comparison is with very recent work
from Hogenboom et al. (2015), who employ a
weighting scheme that is similar to the approach
described in Section 3. They evaluate on the Pang
and Lee data, and consider only lexicon-based
sentiment analysis, obtaining document-level ac-
curacies between 65% (for the baseline) and 72%
(for their best discourse-augmented system). Ta-
ble 1 shows that fully supervised methods give
much stronger performance on this dataset, with
accuracies more than 10% higher.
6 Conclusion
Sentiment polarity analysis has typically relied
on a “preponderance of evidence” strategy, hop-
ing that the words or sentences representing the
overall polarity will outweigh those representing
counterpoints or rhetorical concessions. How-
ever, with the availability of off-the-shelf RST dis-
course parsers, it is now easy to include document-
level structure in sentiment analysis. We show
that a simple reweighting approach offers robust
advantages in lexicon-based sentiment analysis,
and that a recursive neural network can substan-
tially outperform a bag-of-words classifier. Future
work will focus on combining models of discourse
structure with richer models at the sentence level.
