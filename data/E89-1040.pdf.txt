Abstract  
Theoretical research in the area of machine translation usu- 
ally involves the search for and creation of an appropriate 
formalism. An important issue in this respect is the way in 
which the compositionality of translation is to be defined. 
In this paper, we will introduce the anaphoric omponent 
of the Mimo formalism. It makes the definition and trans- 
lation of anaphoric relations possible, relations which are 
usually problematic for systems that adhere to strict com- 
positionality. In iVlimo, the translation of anaphoric rela- 
tions is compositional. The anaphoric omponent is used 
to define linguistic phenomena such as wh-movement, the 
passive and the binding of reflexives and pronouns mono- 
lingually. The actual working of the component will be 
shown in this paper by means of a detailed iscussion of 
wh-movement. 
In t roduct ion 
Theoretical research as part of machine translation often 
aims at finding an appropriate formalism. One of the main 
issues involved is whether the formalism does full justice 
to the idea that the translation of a whole is built from 
the translation of its parts on the one hand and whether 
it leaves enough room for the treatment of exceptions on 
the other hand. In other words, the question is in what 
way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within 
a particular formalism. An answer to this question from 
an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the 
Rosetta system (e.g. Landsbergen 1985). The CAT frame- 
work (e.g. Arnold et a\]. 1986) was meant to be an an- 
swer to the same question, this time for a transfer system, 
viz. the Eurotra system. The MiMo formalism is a re- 
action to the CAT framework and tries to solve several 
translation problems by formulating an alternative defini- 
tion of compositionality. Phenomena involving anaphora 
I such as wh-movement and the coindexation ofpronomi- 
nais often cause problems for strictly compositional systems 
since translation of one word depends on (the translation 
of) another word, one which can be quite far away in the 
sentence. Rosetta tackles this problem by distinguishing 
between rules that are significant with respect o the com- 
posRionality of translation, so-called meaningful rules, and 
rules that  are not, referred to as transformations (Appelo 
et al. 1987); in this way the system is not compositional in 
the strict sense anymore. The not ion of compositlonaUty 
MiMo adheres to is defined in such a way that anaphoric 
relations can be translated compositionally aswell. In this 
paper we wiLi introduce the anaphoric omponent of the 
MiMo formalism. It is used to define Linguistic phenomena 
such as wh-movement, the binding of reflexives and pro- 
nouns, the passive and control phenomena monolinguaLiy. 
The formalism will be discussed by means of an extensive 
description of a possible analysis of wh-movement. 
In the next section, we will first discuss and motivate some 
of the more fundamental characteristics of the MiMo trans- 
lation system. Section two will sketch the MiMo formalism

broaclest lense, as opposed to Chomsky 1981 in which only A-traces 
and reflexives are called anaphoric.

as far as necessary for understanding what will follow. The 
component that deais with the treatment of anaphora will 
be discussed in section 3. In the fourth section the ac- 
tual working of the component will be shown by an elab- 
orate discussion of wh-movement. Finaily, the translation 
of anaphoric relations will be defined and some idea will 
be given of the kind of problems that remain and that will 
have to be subject to further research. 
1 MiMo 
The MiMo formalism tries to come up with an answer to 
the question what compositional translation should imply. 
Strictly compositional systems have to deal with several 
translation problems. As to what these problems exactly 
are depends on the nature of the definition of the notion 
compositionality. In general, two kinds of problems can 
be distinguished. First, there are the problems that arise 
when languages do not really match. Second, the problems 
that occur when translations of two constructions depend 
on one another. 
The former type of problem is caused by lexical and struc- 
tural holes. It means that source and target representation 
do not really match. Lexical holes occur when a language 
lacks words equivalent to the ones in the source language. 
In the case of structural holes, the target language lacks 
an equivalent construction rather than a word. A descrip- 
tion of the concept will have to be used in these cases. For 
an example of a lexical hole, compare sentence (1) and its 
translation into English (2). 
(1) Jan zwemt graag 
(2) John likes to swim 
Unlike sentences with an adverb like 'vandaag', (i) cannot 
be translated c0mpositionally in the strictest sense. The 
translation of (1) is not simply the translation of the parts 
the constituent is composed of. This problem has been 
solved in the CAT framework by liberalizing the definition 
of compositionaiity in such a way that it will be possible to 
render (1) directly into (2), by means of a rule like (3). 
(4) Jan zwom ge,oonlijk 
John used to swim 
(5)  Jan zwom gewoonl i jk graag 
John used to  l i ke  to swim 
The translation of 'gewoonlijk' requires a rule similar to 
(3). However, a combination of 'graag' and 'gewoonlijk' 
appears to be possible as well. An additional rule will have 
to account for this. This will lead to an enormous explosion 
of the number of rules. It is one of the main reasons for an 
alternative definition of compositionality within the MiMo 
system. The nature of the definition allows the translation 
of both 'gewoonlijk' and 'graag' in case they cooccur. A 
translation rule separates a constituent into an ordinary 
part and an exceptional part. Both parts are then trans- 
lated separately and finally, in the target language, the two 
translated parts are joined again. In the case of a sentence 
consisting of both 'graag' and 'gewoonUjk', the sentence 
is separated into an exceptional part, 'graag' for example, 
and an ordinary part, the rest of the sentence. This rest 
again is separated into an exceptional, 'gewoonlijk', and an 
ordinary part. The latter is again that which is left be- 
hind after extraction of the exceptional part. In the end, 
all these parts are joined and will make up a construction 
in the target language. So, in M iMo not all daughters are 
translated in one shot but part of a constituent is translated 
while the rules can still work on the rest of the constituent. 
An  extensive discussion ofproblerns like these is to be found 
in Arnold e.a (1988). 
The second type of problems w.r.t compositionality in
translation involves translation of phrases that are mutu- 
ally dependent. Examples hereof are translations of phrases 
that are anaphorically linked. Translation requires that 
these relations are established. Examples are to be found 
in (8). In (6), the relation between the subject and the re- 
fiexive pronominal is necessary to arrive at the correct form 
of the reflexive pronominal in French. In (7), knowledge of 
the functional status of the wh-word is relevant to be able 
to generate the right case in German. 
(6) the women think of themselves =~ 
les femmes pensent a elles-memes/*ils-memes 
(7) who did you see =~ wen/*wer/*wem sahest du 
(3) rl(sl,s2,graag) ==~ r2(t(sl),r3(like,t(s2))) 
By (3) a construction composed of three daughters, l, s2 
and 'graag' will be translated into a construction having 
two daughters, viz. the translation of sl and a construc- 
tion that again has two daughters, that is, the verb 'like' 
and the translation of s2. The main disadvantage of this 
approach is the fact that combinations of exceptions have 
to be described explicitly again, see (4) and (5). 
In this paper we will examine the component of the MiMo 
formalism that has been developed to enable the formula. 
tion of anaphoric relations on the one hand and composi- 
tional translation on .the other. The system distinguishes 
itself from other systems in the field of computational lin- 
guistics, such as GPSG (Gazdar et al. 1985), PATR (see 
e.g. Shieber 1986) and DCG (Pereira and Warren 1980) 
for its central notion of modularity. The formalism enables 
- 300 - 
the writer of rules to express generalizations in a simple 
and declarative way. This will be exemplified in section 
4. In an MT context, it is however not enough to es- 
tablish anaphoric relations monolingually. The question 
is what the behaviour of these relations in translation is. 
In MiMo, it is possible to translate the relations composi- 
tionally. This will be discussed in section 5. 
2 The basic model  
In this section an overview of the MiMo system will be given 
as far as is relevant for the rest of this paper. The system's 
architecture is as in (8). In (8) it is indicated that a text in 
(8) source text  
l ana lyse 
source-I 
\[ transfer 
target-I 
\[ synthese 
ta rget  text  
a source language is parsed into an interface structure (I). 
This I-structure, in its turn, is translated into an interface 
structure in the target language. From this structure the 
target language text can then be generated. In this paper, 
mainly the construction of I-structures, through analysis 
and through transfer, will be focused on, hence the impor- 
tance of understanding what these structures look like in 
MiMo terms. 
An I-structure is a tree. The mother node consists of the 
lexical identifier (LI, the name of the lexical element), possi- 
bly provided with a set of features, and a number of slots. 
Slots can be filled with other I-structures that meet the 
requirements specified by the slots. (9) is an example of 
an I-structure. The I-structure (9) has an LI 'kiss' and two 
(9) k i ss (verb)  (10) k iss (verb)  
/ \ .\[subjfjohn(n), 
subj(n) obj(n) obj=mary(n)\] 
I I 
john(n)  mary(n) 
slots, an object slot and a subject slot. Fillers of these slots 
will have to be nominal. The subject slot has been filled by 
an I-structure that has 'john' as LI, the object slot by the 
I-structure with LI 'mary'. We will abbreviate structures 
like these as in (10) henceforth. So, an I-structure consists 
of a certain LI, a feature bundle in parenthesis and a num- 
ber of slots in square brackets preceded by a dot. A slot 
is made up of the name followed by the equal sign and the 
I-structure that fills it. 
Possible I-structures are defined in the lexicon. Distinct 
(phrase structure) rules that define I-structures are not 
needed, all structures are specified in the lexicon. Gen- 
eralizations hould be expressed in the lexicon as well. The 
advantage of this approach is the possibility of defining all 
subcategorization phenomena directly. So, only coherent 
structures in the sense of LFG (Bresnan 1982) are built. 
In the lexicon, the slots have not yet been filled by other 
I-structures. The I-structure for 'kiss' looks like (11) in the 
lexicon, the question marks indicate that the slot are still 
empty. In (12) the lexical representation f 'john' is given, 
which has no slots. When an I-structure can fill the slot of 
(11) kiss(v) (12) john(n).\[\] 
.\[subj = ?(n), 
obj = ?(n) 3 
some other I-structure, the features of the slot and those 
of the I-structure are unified (see e.g. Shieber 1987). The 
I-structures represented so far were simplified for the sake 
of readability. In reality, there is the possibility of indicat- 
ing whether slots are optional or obligatory. Slots can also 
be marked with the Kleene star. The effect of this opera- 
tor is that the slot is copied when an I-structure fills the 
slot. The I-structure will fill the copy and the original slot 
remains as it was. The slot can he filled several times by 
I-structures in this way. The slot for modmers is in fact 
marked with the Kleene star 2 . An I-structure for (13a) 
looks like (13b) s . 
(13) a. De mooie vrouw ontmoet mannen op zondag 
The n ice  woman meets  men on sunday 
b. ontmost (v ,present )

obj = man(n,plural) 
. \ [ *mod = ? ( )S ,  
mod = op(prep) 
.\[obj = zondag(n), 
*mod = ?()\]

Some words in the lexicon can have the special feature

correct from a linguistic point of view. However, translation ;- often 
much slmp\]er this way. The representation f modifiers is s field in 
MT that deserves further attention. 
SNote that the order of slots is quite arbitrary. Surface order is 
not reI~ted to the order of slots in l-structures in any way. 
- 301  - 
'anaphor'. I-structures having this feature will have to be 
bound by an antecedent in the end. Examples of these are 
pronouns and reflexives. This requirement also holds for 
empty slots. They are considered anaphoric and will have 
to be bound as well unless we deal with optional slots. 
Binding of I-structures happens through anaphoric rules. 
In the next section we will show the way these rules are 
formulated. The final structure of (13a) will be (14). In 
(14), a relation between the topic (Ii) and the embedded 
subject position (I2) 4 is established s . The subordinate

{ topic_trace(I1,I2)} 
complementizer is also regarded as a lexical word. Even 
sentences that do not show a complernentizer at surface 
are assigned one. This is not in any way intrinsic to MiMo 
but makes a uniform account of several phenomena possi- 
ble. This type of cornplementizer has two slots: an optional 
slot for topics or wh-words and a slot for a verb construc- 
tion. 
3 The definition of anaphoric rela- 
t ions 
Anaphoric relations are defined by a type of rule that is 
quite different from the ordinary rules. This distinguishes 
the system from, for example DCG. With PATR and DCG 
the possibility of percolation from, say topic to trace, influ- 
ences all the other ules. MiMo's approach, a separate type 
of rule for the anaphoric omponent, has the advantage of
leaving the other rules, i.e the lexical I-structures, as they 
are. Modularity is one of MiMo's qualities. This quality is 
also considered important in GPSG (Gasdar et al. 1985) 
where it is realized by the use of metarules that multiply 
the number of rules. This would be undesirable in MiMo 
411 and I2 are unique nantes which are autonmtlcally assigned to 
every I-structure. We will indicate them henceforth as capitalized 
words. Names to which no further eference is nmde will be omitted 
for clarlty's ake. An I-structure consists of a tree and 8 set of anno- 
tstlons that denote the anaphoric relations within the tree. The tree 
annotated with this set will be called I-object henceforth. 
6Note that we will usually leave out optional slots thet are not  
KUed 
since every lexical word is its own rule. So then even the 
number of words would have to be multiplied. 
The use of a different rule type is also motivated by the 
process of translating anaphoric relations. If we only used 
feature percolation to encode anaphoric relations, the rela- 
tions established would not be explicit anymore. Annota- 
tions in MiMo are clearly distinguishable from the rest of 
the representation a d as such make it possible to define a 
compositional translation of them in transfer. 
Besides being modular, the system also proves to be declar- 
ative. Both qualities, modularity and declarativity, en- 
hance the workability for the user. Changes and exten- 
sions are quite easily achieved and rules can be defined in 
a general way. An anaphoric omponent written for one 
particular language can often be used for another language 
with minor changes. 
Anaphoric rules create anaphoric relations within I- 
structures. This has two consequences in our system. In the 
first place, some of the features of antecedent and anaphor 
are unified. These features are called 'transparent'. This, 
for example, makes it possible to define agreement phenom- 
ena. The linguist defines which features are transparent 
with respect o a certain rule. The motivation for this ap- 
proach is discussed at length in Krauwer et al. (1987). The 
main point is that identity of some but not all features is 
required in an antecedent-anaphor relation. In the second 
place, the I-structure is augmented with an annotation that 
specifies the binding. This annotation consists of the name 
of the relation and the unique names of the nodes between 
which the relation exists. The definition of anaphoric re- 
lations makes use of these annotations ( ee also section 5). 
A relation cannot be created unless the correct structural 
relation between antecedent and anaphor exists. So the 
grammar writer defines for each relation: 
1) the name of the relation 
2) the transparent features 
3) the structural relation 
An example of an anaphoric rule is the one that estab- 
lishes a relation between a wh-element and an open slot. 
The rule looks like (15) e MiMo 7 . 
(15) wh_trace : c_command( {wh}, {open} )- 
{agreement,case} 
The wh-trace relation is established when the structural 
relation c_cornnmnd holds between a wh-constituent and 
eIn f~ct, the wh-trace rel~tlon is subject o more restrlct;ons than 
c-commandment. We will return to this in section 4. 
7A special feature 'open' is used to refer to  open  slots. All slots 
have this feature by default as long ~" they are not filled. Sot 'open' 
can be regarded as a feature of the trace ~;nce slots not  (yet )  FtUed 
can he considered potential traces. 
- 302-  
an open slot The agreement features and the case fea- 
ture are unified if possible, if not, the relation will not be 
established. The structural relation itself, c_command in 
this case, is defined by the user as well. Either a simple 
structural relation is defined or a complex structural rela- 
tion. The latter is composed of a regular expression over 
structural relations s . An example of a simple structural 
relation is the sister-relation, defined in (16). 
(16) s ister(ANT,ANA) : (17) c_command: 
?() .\[ ? : ?(ANT), s ister + 
? = ?(ANA) \] ancestor  
The structural relation sister holds between the Lstructures 
ANT and ANA if there exists an I-structure in which both 
ANT and ANA fill slots The exact nature of the LIs is 
not important nor are the features or the names of the 
slots, hence their representation asquestion marks in (16) 9 
 A complex structural relation is defined by means of a 
regular expression over structural relations. The regular 
expressions make use of the operators '^', indicating op- 
tionality, ';' for disjunction, '*' for iterativity (0, 1 or more 
times ) and '+' .  The latter has a special meaning which 
can best be explained by means of the definition of the 
c_command relation mentioned in (17). The '+ '  operator 
indicates that the sister relation should hold between the 
antecedent and some intermediate node and the ancestor- 
relation between this intermediate node and the anaphor. 
The Prolog-variant of (17) is (18) So, the c_command re- 
lation holds between the I-structures ANT and ANA when 
one of ANT's sisters is ANA's ancestor. The MiMo defini- 
(18) c_command(Ant,Ana) : -
s i s te r (Ant ,X ) ,  ancestor(X,Ana) .  
tion of 'ancestor' is given in (19a). The relation is defined in 
terms of the simple relation 'mother'. The structural rela- 
tion of the latter is in (19b) 1° . Features can be added to the 
structural pattern to restrict he range of possible relations 
further. This will be illustrated in the fourth section when 
we discuss a possible way of treating wh-movement. To 
aThls idea il partly based on LFG's notion of functional uncer- 
tainty. See Kaplan et al. 1987. 
°Note that the order of ANT w.r.t ANA is not relevant since the 
order of the slots is not in any way related to word order in the 
sentence. 
l°All I-structures are also their own ancestor according to the deft- 
nlt|onin (19a). This is the correct result when used in the c_command 
deKnltlon since sisters do c_command one another. In case this is uno 
desirable however, the relation could be def ined as follows :
ancestor : mother + * mother 
Generally, the correct deKrdtlon of a relation llke c.command depends 
of course on the use it's being made of in anaphorlc rules and on the 
make up of the I-structures used. The definition above should merely 
be regarded as an exemplification f the mechanism. 
(19) a. ancestor  : * mother 
b. mother(ANT,ANA) : 
?(ANT). \ [  ? = ?(ANA)

4 WH-Movement  
In this section, the actual working of the anaphoric ompo- 
nent will be discussed. We will do this by showing how a 
linguistic phenomenon like wh-movement could be imple- 
mented. Note that none of the linguistics in this section 
follows from the system. The aim of the discussion is to 
give an idea of the power of the anaphoric omponent and of 
the kinds of linguistics that can be put to use. We will first 
introduce the linguistic environment and present some data 
from Spanish that reflect some of the surface phenomena 
caused by the presence of anaphoric relations. The section 
on the implementation of the wh-relation will argue that 
and show how surface phenomena of this nature can be 
handled deterministically. 
4.1 Introduct ion 
The wh-trace relation seems the most interesting one be- 
cause it shows both how general and powerful the mecha- 
nism is and how restrictive the rules should be to account 
for the data At least the data shown in (21) should be 
accounted for. In the GB framework (e.g. Chomsky 1981), 
wh-movement is seen as an instance of the transformation 
'move alpha', which respects the subjacency principle. The

For English, S and NP are assumed to be bounding nodes. 
Wh-movement takes place cyclically via the comp-posltions 
of the intermediate clauses, leaving behind traces (the so- 
called comp-to-comp movement). As such, it does not cross 
more than one bounding node at a time in a structure like 
(23). 
Our discussion of wh-movement in the next section is in 
accordance with the comp-to-comp movement. Although 
other approaches, uch as direct movement, are feasible too, 
we win adhere to the comp-to-comp approach. Data from 
Spanish (Torrego 1984) also seem to support he preference 
for actual movement from complementizer to complemen- 
tizer.

According to Torrego, inversion is obligatory in all clauses 
except the lowest. In the lowest clause, inversion is op- 
tional. The GB theory accounts for this by claiming that 
for Spanish S-bar, instead of S, is the bounding node. This 
predicts that movement in the lowest cycle can take place 
in two ways, as shown in (25). Neither of the two violates 
subjacency. Assuming that a wh-constituent, or its trace, 
in comp triggers inversion, the variation in Spanish word- 
order in the lowest cycle is accounted for. 
We will return to these data in the next section. We 
will argue that these data can be handled by the MiMe- 
mechanism as well, given the correct rules for the binding 
4.2  Imp lementat ion  
The structural relation for wh-movement should reflect he 
idea that the wh-constltuent may bind across one bound- 
ing node at most. Note that, before and after the crossing 
of this bounding node, it may theoretically cross an unlim- 
ited number of nodes that are not bounding. The struc- 
tural relation that reflects this idea looks like (26b), the 
wh-trace relation is defined in (26a). The wh-trace rela- 
(26) a. wh_trace : sub jacent (wh,open) -  
~agreement,case~ 
b. sub jacent :  s i s te r  + sub j_path  
c. sub j_path : *mother (~nobounding~,~)  
+ "mother (~bound ing~,~)  
+ *mother(~nobounding~,~)  
tion is established by the structural relation subjacent be- 
tween a wh-element and an open slot. The definition of the 
subjacent-relation closely resembles that of c_command. 
Instead of the relation 'ancestor', a relation 'subj_path' is 
defined that specifies a path consisting of one bounding 
node at most. Non-bounding nodes may invervene freely. 
Subjacency then is not defined as a filter, it is a positive 
formulation of possible relations. Note that (26) is valid 
both for languages in which S is a bounding node, such as 
English, and for languages which have S-bar as bounding 
node. The difference in boundedness will be expressed in 
the lexicon and the bindings will be established according 
to the definition of subjacency and given the boundedness 
of particular nodes 11 . 
As has been shown in (25a) and (25b), the trace can always 
be bound in two ways in languages that have S-bar as a 
bounding node, provided there are at least two clauses in 
between the antecedent and the trace. We can make good 
tZThe difference between bridge verbs and other verbs is abe en- 
coded in the lexicon. Only bridge verbs allow comp-to-comp move- 
ment. The genernlization might be expressed by assigning the feature 
bounding to sbar complements and modifiers in all other cases. Like 
this, sbar is a bounding node in some cases too. 
- 304  - 
use of this in MiMo. The Spanish synthesis component 
can check whether the comp-position of a clause is either 
filled or bound. If so, the clause is inverted. In this way, 
the variation in word order in Spanish wh-questions will be 
quite naturally accounted for. 
This leaves us to show that our definition of wh-trace in- 
deed establishes a relation in two dlITerent ways between 
the antecedent and the open position. (27b) shows the 
MiMo version of the structure in (27a). (27c) indicates 
the way in which the relation is found without binding the 
complementizer in the embedded clause. The relation 'sis- 
ter' holds between the antecedent and the node 'pensado'. 
Ths node in its turn binds the open position 13, through 
mother-relations. The movement involves the crossing of 
one bounding node. (27d) indicates the relation found.

(28) shows that two relations can be found. The GB struc- 
ture and the M iMo structure are shown in (28a) and (28b) 
respectively. In (28cl), the relation between 11 and I2 is 
found and (28c2) shows the one between I2 and 13. Both 
relations are mentioned in (28d). 
In (28), the intermediate empty complementiser-position is 
bound, hence inversion will take place. In (27) the comple- 
menti~.er is neither filled nor bound, so no inversion in this 
case. The data are accounted for in quite a natural and 
linguistically sound way. They are the direct consequence 
of the definitions of structural relations and they do not 
have to be generated by some kind of arbitrary inversion 
mechanism.

gual account of coindexation is quite an achievement. In 
machine translation, the most important part of research 
deals with the translation of the relations that were estab- 
lished monolingually. 
The I-object to be translated consists of an I-structure an- 
notated with anaphorlc relations. An  I-object is the result 
of the application of certain anaphoric relations (denoted 
by the annotations) to a particular I-structure. The com- 
positional translation of an I-object is the result of the ap- 
plication of the translated annotations to the translated 
I-structure. We hold the view that anaphoric relations are 
universal in MiMo. The translation of a relation between 
the I-structures I and J is that same relation between the 
translations of I and J. This is summarized in (29). 
(29) the translation of an I-object: 
The translation of an I-object Ii is the result of the appli- 
cation of the translations of the annotations of I1 to the 
translation of Ii's I-structure. The translation of an anno- 
tation RCI,J) is R(tCl),t(J)). 
The final set of anaphoric relations of the target object 
should be equivalent to the set that existed at the source 
level. The following example illustrates principle (30) : 
The t rans la t ion  o f  anaphor ic  rela- 
t ions  
(30) Por que \[ dice Juan \[ que \[los dos creian \[ que \[ Pedro 
habia pensado \[ que \[ el grupo habia aplazado la reunion 
Why say John that the two thought that Peter believed 
that the group postponed the meeting 
In this section, we intend to give an impression of the use- 
fulness of coindex relations in translation and the transla- 
tion of the relations themselves. In linguistics, a monolin- 
Inversion being obligatory in all clauses except he lowest, 
'por que' can only bind the modifier position in either the 
first or the second clause. Each relation further down is ex- 
- 305 - 
cluded as more clauses would have to show inversion then. 
When we ignore the bindings established at the Spanish 
I-level, translation into English will produce a lot of pos- 
sible translations since 'that' rnhy or may not be inserted 
in every complementiser position in English. However, the 
impact of this cornplementizer on possible anaphoric rela- 
tions is not totally irrelevant. According to WAHL (1987), 
the complementizer blocks binding of 'why' to an empty 
position deeper down, cf. (31) and (32). 
(31) why(i)/(j) do you think _(i) the boat sank _(j) 
(32) why(i) do you think _(i) that the boat sank _ 
(37). 
(37) Hoe graag zwom Jan =:, How much did John like to 
swim 
Since 'graag' is displaced, translation of 'graag' as the ex- 
ceptional part of the embedded sentence is not possible, 
given that the movement is not undone 12 . These cases 
are even noncompositional from MiMo's tolerant view on 
compositionality. 
When we preserve the bindings from Spanish and we claim 
that in English 'that'  may never be inserted when its mod- 
ifier position is bound to an antecedent, we can determin- 
istically arrive at the right translation : 
(33) Pot que \[ dice Juan \[ que \[los dos creian \[ que \[ Pedro 
habia pensado \[ que \[ el grupo habia aplazado la reunion 
(34) Why \[ did John say \[ \[ the two thought \[ that \[ Peter 
believed \[ (that) the group had postponed the meeting 
Both are ambiguous ince both can question the reason 
for John's 'saying it' and 'the two believing it'. Other in- 
terpretations are excluded in both Spanish and English. 
Definition (29) also causes some problems. Take the fol- 
lowing example from Italian (cf. Chomsky 1981) : 
(35) l'uomo \[che mi domando \[chi abbia visto\]\] 
the man(i) of whom I wonder who(j) e(i) saw e(j) 
One might wonder what the English translation would have 
to be in the first place. In MiMo, the incorrect literal trans- 
lation will not be found because the necessary anaphoric re- 
lations cannot be established. In cases like these, separate 
translation rules are needed to arrive at a translation of 
(35). It is possible to refer explicitly to anaphoric relations 
as long as they are restricted in depth. This is necessary in 
case an expression without anaphorlc relations translates 
into one which requires s linking between an antecedent 
and an anaphor. An example is (36). 
(36) Jan zwernt graag =~ John(i) likes _(i) to swim 
Unboundedly deep embedded relations are however not ac- 
cessible by translation rules in the transfer component. 
Another problem we face deals with the interaction of 
anaphora nd other standard 'non-compositional' phenom- 
ena, such as the example of Dutch 'graag' translating as 
'to like' in English (see section 1). These examples, as well 
as anaphora, can be handled compositlonally, as we have 
shown. The interaction however poses some problems, see 
Conclusion 
In this paper we showed the need for a non-standard notion 
of compositionality in translation. With the MiMo defini- 
tion of compositionality we are able to define the transla- 
tion of sentence level anaphora. In MiMo, anaphoric rela- 
tions are defined by a separate type of rule. This enables 
linguists to define anaphoric relations in a declarative and 
modular way. It appeared that linguistic generalizations 
can be defined quite naturally and generally. It is up to 
the linguist to decide which generalizations are to be pre- 
ferred and how they can best be expressed. We chose to 
formulate principles in a general way. The relation 'subja- 
cent' was meant o serve all languages. Restrictions, e.g. by 
semantic features, can be added freely. The definitions re- 
late to information that is encoded in the language-specific 
lexicon. This produces the variations that exist across lan- 
guages. 
The use of a separate type of rule enables a compositional 
definition of the translation of anaphorlc relations because 
the applied rules are still visible - as annotations - in the 
structure to be translated. The translation of an I-object 
was defined as the translation of the I-structure to which 
the translations of the anaphoric rules applied. The trans- 
lation of an anaphoric rule is the target equivalent of that 
rule. This point of view poses problems in cases where the 
source language is less restrictive than the target language. 
In that case, special rules have to be written to assign a 
translation onetheless. When a particular elation (read 
also : interpreation) has been established in the source lan- 
guage, it should be present in the target language. All 
interpretations should be translated of course. This is not 
yet possible in the current system when unboundedly deep 
relations need to be seen in the transfer component. 
t2It is of course also possible to assume that 811 wh-movmuents have 
been undone. In Mimo, this only means ~ shift of problems from the 
transfer to the analysis and synthesis modules. Besides, the issue 
would still hold for other long-dlstance phenomen8 like pronouns.
