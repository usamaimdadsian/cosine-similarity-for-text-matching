In this paper, we put Torward some ideas on 
the reoresentation of time in a machine 
translat ion system. In such a system, we 
usually have the following four representations: 
- source text 
- source representation 
- target representation 
- target text 
In an inter l ingual  system, there is no 
difference between source and target 
representation; in a transfer-based system, 
the step between the two is usually called 
transfer, and this step is meant to be as 
simple as possible. 
The research described was or ig ina l ly  done in 
the framework of the EUROTRA MT project,  
which is transfer-based. However, i t  can 
be used in other MT systems as well; in 
Tact, i t  is very well suited for inter l ingual  
systems. 
The problem with time meaning is that i t  is 
expressed in natural languages in a way that 
is non-universal and, moreover, not very 
perspicuous prima facie. As a consequence, i t  
is d i f f i cu l t  to find rules for the 
translation of the tense form of the verb. 
In this paper, we propose a conceptual 
calculus in which the meanings of 
language specific temporal expressions 
can be represented in an inter l ingual  way, 
so that the translation of the la t ter  can 
be achieved via the corresponding conceptual 
representations. 
The exposition wi l l  consist of three parts. 
F i rst ,  we define a time axis model, i .e .  a 
model in which temporal concepts can be 
understood. 
Second, we establish two types of general 
constraints: 
~i) Constraints on possible time meaning 
representations, result ing in a restr icted 
class of meanings for time anO related 
phenomena in terms of this model. 
( i i )  Constraints on the relat ions between 
syntactic/morphological forms and time 
meanings, result ing in a non-arbitrary 
re lat ion between form and meaning. 
Third, we show how the calculus can be 
used for the inter l ingual  analysis of 
the tense forms of verbs. 
I. The time axis model. 
The model is a temporal structure 
<time,< >, where 
time is a set of elements called time-points; 
( i i )  
< is a binary re lat ion that l inear ly  orders 
time (and can be interpreted as 'precedes'); 
An interval (1) is a subset of time that does 
not contain 'gaps', i . e . :  ~ t l , t2  E I 
t3 G time (t1<t3<t2 -> t3 E I ). 
We now turn to the time meanings anq their 
representations. 
F i rst ,  we want to separate the expression 
that represents time meaning from the rest of 
the sentence. The instruments we use are 
based on Dowty (1979): 
(i) 
A tNo-place operator AT that takes an 
interval  and a formula to yield another 
formula, with the following interpretat ion:  
W(AT(I~O)=I at whatever time t if÷ W(O)=I at 
the interval I. 
(i i~ 
Temporal predicates that take an interval to 
yield a formula, e.g. ,  
W(yesterday(1))=1 i f f  the interval I is a 
subset of yesterday. 
35 
( i i i )  
Temporal re lat ions  that take two i n terva ls  
to y ie ld  a formula, e .g . ,  
W(beforeil, J))=1 i f f  
t , t '  c time (t E I & t '  s J - - -> t<t ' )  
( i v )  
k -abst rac t ion  to  separate  the temporal  
express ion  from the bas ic  p ropos i t ion ,  so 
that  the representat ion  of the temporal  
expresss ion  takes the following form: 
(I) 
k p 3 I , ,  I=, . . .S time (Re l , ( I j , l , )  k . .°  & 
Pred.( l . J  & m.!  & AT ( I , ,  p) ) 
where the I, are in terva ls ,  the Relj are 
binary re la t ions  between in terva ls  l i ke  
:be fore  , the Predw are pred icates  l i ke  
yesterday ~, and p is a basic propos i t ion ,  
from which a l l  t ime-relevant parts have 
been removed. 
The category of expression (I 
be applied to a basic proposi 
functional way. 
) is t / t ;  i t  can 
t ion in a 
The in terpreta t ion  of (I) is the set of 
proposit ions that are true at some given 
in terva l  I , .  This is s imi lar  to Kripke's 
de f in i t ion  of the notion of 'possible wor ld ' :  
'A possible world is given by the descr ipt ive 
condit ions we associate with i t  . . . .  ' (1972, 
p. 44). Analogously, a time in terva l  
can be ident i f ied  with the co l lec t ion  of 
proposit ions that are true at i t .  
2. A theory  of time meanings. 
In many discussions of time meaning, a 
Oist inct ion is made between an internal  and 
an external temporal system. The external 
system represents the tempora l  re la t ion  
between the state of affairs as described by 
the basic proposit ion and the time at which 
the utterance takes place. This system always 
refers to the speaker or wr i te r ,  and 
consequently i t  is a de ic t i c  system. The 
internal  system is about such things as 
whether the state of a f fa i r s  expressed in the 
basic proposit ion is described as going on, 
having lus t  s ta r ted ,  having been completed,  
etc. This type of information is often cal led 
aspectual. 
In th is  paper, we adopt the fo l lowing three 
basic pr inc ip les  for the representation of 
time meanings: 
(I) 
Each time meaning representation contains 
exact ly three time in terva ls :  
- the time of speech or narrat ion (S) 
- the time of event (E), i . e .  the in terva l  
at which the basic proposit ion is said 
to be true 
- one time of re ference  (R) 
The S- interval  consists of one point only: 
i t  is a s ingleton. The R- and E- in terva ls  are 
non-empty subsets of time. 
( I I )  
The de ic t i c  part of time meaning is represented 
by a binary re la t ion  between S and R and 
opt iona l ly  by one pred icate  over  R, 
( I l l )  
Aspect is represented by a binary re la t ion  
between R and E, and opt iona l ly  by one 
predicate over E. 
Pr inciples (1), ( I I ) ,  and ( I l l )  together 
imply that the general form of a time meaning 
representation can be somewhat s imp l i f ied .  I t  
w i l l  now be: 
(2) 
k p 3 S,R,E ~ t ime (Re l t (R ,S )  & Pred.(R)  & 
Rel=(E,R) & Pred=(E) & AT(E,p))  
Apart from the constraints on possible 
time meaning representations there are some 
constraints on the re la t ion  between the 
time meanings and the language speci f ic  
morphosyntactic forms for expressing those 
meanings: 
(IV) 
The pred icates  over R are those t ime 
adverbials that can be used as answers to 
when-questions, such as 
(3) yesterday, now, next week, on Tuesday 
(V) 
The pred icates  over E are (a .o . )  the 
duration time adverbials,  such as 
(4) for an hour, f i ve  weeks, since 
Christmas, unt i l  ~une 
(vI) 
The re la t ions  between R and S and between 
E and R are  determined by the in teract ion  
of the verbal tense forms and the time 
adverbials in ways to be specif ied and 
exemplif ied in section three. 
We w i l l  now present the de ic t i c  and the 
aspectual components of the temporal system 
in some deta i l .  
2.1. The de ic t ic  system. 
As possible re la t ions  between S and R we 
w i l l  take 
( i)  before (R,S), defined as in I. 
( i i )  a f ter  (R,S), defined analogously 
( i i i )  contain (R,S), defined as fol lows : 
t s time (t ~ S - - -> t ~ R) 
36 
The speci f iers  of the reference time are the 
when-adverbials. A c lass i f i ca t ion  of the 
la t te r  that appears to be relevant for the 
assignment of de ic t i c  values in par t i cu lar  
cases is the fo l lowing one : 
in fac t ,  an i te ra t ive  in terpreta t ion ,  and fo r  
such in terpreta t ions  we need a more complex 
representat ion  format .  This wi l l  not be 
developed in th i s  paper,  but see Van Eynde 
(forthcoming). 
de ic t ic  abso lu te  
before a f te r  conta in  on Tuesday 
yesterday n xt now 
week 
The de ic t i c  when-adverb ia l s  de f ine  the pos i t ion  
of the re fe rence  t ime with respect  to the t ime 
of speech, and cannot be combined with a l l  
possible tenses. An af ter -adverb ia l  is ,  for 
instance, not compatible with the simple past: 
(5) * he came next week 
The absolute when-adverbials determine the 
posit ion of the reference time independently 
from the speech time. Depending an which tense 
they are combined with they can e i ther  specify 
a re ference  t ime that  precedes the speech t ime,  
as in 
(b) she came on Tuesday 
or a re fe rence  t ime that  fo l lows  the speech 
t ime,  as in 
(7) she comes/ is coming/w i l l  co le  on Tuesday 
Since there is only one reference time in the 
representation (= pr inc ip le  ( I ) )  and since 
the when-adverbials always specify the reference 
time (= pr inc ip le  ( IV)) ,  i t  is predicted that a 
proposit ion can contain at most one when-adverbial. 
At f i r s t  sight th is  predict ion seems to hold: 
of. the ungrammaticality of
(8) a. * He le f t  yesterday one week ago 
b. * In 1990 he w i l l  have arr ived in 1998 
c. * In 1955 he had died in 1944 
There are,  however, some problem cases, such as 
(9) He le f t  on Tuesday at 9 o 'c lock  
(10) Last year he used to a r r ive  at 9 o 'c lock  
(9) contains two when-adverbials, but notice 
that they can be used together as an answer to 
one when-question, and th is  indicates that 
on Tuesday at 9 o 'c lock '  is just a complex 
speci f icat ion of one and the same in terva l .  
(10) is a more serious case. Here the two 
adverbials cannot be considered to specify the 
same in terva l :  ' l as t  year' denotes the time 
of his habit to arr ive  at 9 o'clock and 
"at 9 o 'c lock '  denotes the time of each of his 
a r r iva l s  of last year. What we have in (10) is ,  
2.2. The aspectual part.  
There is much discussion in the l i te ra ture  
about what aspect is.  A descript ion that is 
nat very precise, but has the merit of being 
independent of l ingu is t i c  form, is the one 
given by Coerie (1976, p. 3): 
'As the general de f in i t ion  of aspect, we may 
take the formulation that "aspects are 
d i f fe rent  ways of viewing the internal  
temporal constituency of a s i tuat ion" .  
In an ar t i c le  on the general theory of 
aspect Friedrich distinguishes three 
possible aspects : 
( i )  punctual, completive, per fect ive,  etc; 
( i i )  durat ive,  cont inuat ive,  etc; 
( i i i )  s ta t ive ,  perfect,  etc. 
(o f .  F r iedr i ch  1974, p. 36) 
The same th ree  aspects  turn  up in the work 
of Coer ie ,  3ohnsan, Hopper, and o thers .  
We wi l l  ca l l  them respect ive ly  perfect ive,  
imperfect ive, and retrospect ive.  
The in tu i t ions  about the three are bas ica l ly  
the fo l lowing:  
( i )  perfect ive 
This aspect presents a s i tuat ion  'as a 
single unanalyzable whole' (Camrie, o .c . ,  
p. 3).  
( i i )  imperfective: 
This aspect ' looks at the s i tuat ion  from the 
ins ide'  (Comrie, op. t i t ,  p.4),  and focusses 
on beginning, cont inuat ion,  or ending of i t .  
( i i i )  retrospect ive:  
This aspect 'expresses a re la t ion  between two 
t ime-points,  on the one hand the time of the 
state resul t ing from a pr ior  s i tuat ion ,  and 
on the other the time of that pr ior  
s i tuat ion . '  ( ib id . ,  p. 52). 
In order to make these nations more precise, 
and -at the same time- to integrate them into 
our representation format, we w i l l  adopt the 
fol lowing proposal by Johnson: 
'What I am proposing concerning the semantics 
of the aspect forms is that they specify the 
re la t ion  between reference time and event time 
in an utterance. '  (Johnson 1981, p. 153) 
37 
As app l ied  to  the d i f fe rent  aspects th i s  
g ives  the fo l low ing  resu l t s  : 
( i )  per fec t ive :  
In th ,s  case we take the re la t ion  between E and 
R to be one of containment (dur ing (E ,R) ) twhere  
the la t te r  i s  de f ined  as fo l lows :  
dur ing  ix ,y )  i f f  ~ t E t ime i t  s x - - ->  t e y) 
The fac t  that  E i s  conta ined  in R i s  meant to  
be the formal counterpar t  of the in tu i t ion  that  
E i s  seen as a s ing le  unana lyzab le  whole from 
the po in t  of view def ined  by R. 
( i i )  imperfect(re: 
This is subdivided into three classes: 
i i . i )  durat ive:  contain (E,R), defined as in 2.1.  
( focus on the cont inuat ion)  
i i . i i )  inchoative: since (E,R), de f in i t ion :  
s inceix,y)  i f f  x n y # 
& 3 t" E time ~ t e time i t  E x & t '  E~y - - -> t '<t )

i i i . i i i )  terminat ive:  Unt i l  iE,R), de f in i t ion :  
unt i l i x ,y )  i f f  x n y # e 
3 t e t ime ~ t '  E t ime (t  s x ~ t "  E y - - ->  t ( t ' )  
& 3 t"  s time ~ t i time ( t  E x ~ t "  E y ---> t '>t )  
( focus on the ending of E) 
( i i i )  retrospect ive:  
The re la t ion  is simply before (E,R). 
Some authors  a lso  d i s t ingu ish  a soca l led  
'p rospect ive '  aspect (o f .  Comrie 1976). I t  
seems to  be less  common than the other  ones, 
and there  i s  some disagreement on the issue 
of what i t s  language spec i f i c  counterpar ts  
are ( ' to  be going to '  ? ) ,  but conceptua l ly  
i t  can be defined fa i r l y  eas i ly ,  namely as 
the complement of the retrospect ive aspect: 
( i v )  p rospect ive :  a f te r  (E,R) 
The in terva l  E can be specif ied by 
adverbials.  One class of E-specif iers is the 
class of duration adverbials.  The reasons 
for t reat ing these adverbials as 
E-specif iers are the fol lowing ones : 
I. they always denote the in terva l  at which 
the basic proposit ion is said to take place; 
in that  respect  they are d i f fe rent  from the 
when-adverbials, since the la t te r  can also 
denote a time that does not coincide with the 
event time (of. the non-perfect(re aspects). 
2. they cannot be combined with a l l  possible 
proposit ions; they are, for instance, not 
compatible with momentaneous events: 
(11) they reached the summit for  a wh i le  
The ungrammat ica l i ty  of 411) can be exp la ined  
i f  we take the durat ion  adverb ia l s  to  spec i fy  
the event time, since the la t te r  cannot be 
both a moment (as requ i red  by the propos i t ion)  
and an in terva l  of some durat ion  las requ i red  
by the adverb ia l ) .  
3. they never have a de(eric function: they 
are not used for specifying the re la t ion  
between some in terva l  and the.moment of speech. 
As in the case of the when-adverb ia l s  i t  i s  
poss ib le  to have two durat ion  adverb ia l s  in the 
same c lause:  
(12) he has been s tudy ing  two hours a day 
s ince h is  ch i ldhood  now 
Not ice ,  however, that  i12) has an i te ra t ive  
in terpreta t ion ,  and s ince the t reatment  of 
such in terpreta t ions  requ i res  a more 
elaborated representation scheme anyway, 
we can st ick to the pr inc ip le  that a clause 
contains at most one E-speci f ier .  In th is  case 
the E-specif ier  is "since his chi ldhood';  
'two hours' is another type of spec i f ier  (cf. 
Van Eynde, forthcoming). 
2.3.  The ca lcu lus  as a whole. 
In the preceding sections i t  has been st ipu lated 
that there are three possible re la t ions  between 
S and R, and six possible re la t ions  between R 
and E. At f i r s t  sight that seems to be rather 
a rb i t ra ry ,  but a careful analysis of the concepts 
involved shows that they, in fact ,  exhaust the 
range of log ica l  poss ib i l i t i es  : 
For any tuo in terva ls  x and y c time, 
e i ther  x n y = 0 
and then e i ther  be fore ix ,y )  
or a f te r  (x ,y )  
or x n y # 0 
and then e i ther  x c y, i . e .  dur ing(x ,y~ 
or ~(x c y) 
and then e i ther  x = y, 
i . e .  contain(x,yJ 
or - (x  = y) 
and then e i ther  s ince~x,v~ 
or unt i l  ~x,y) 
These are the six aspectual values. The reason 
why the de(eric system has only three possible 
values is that the speech time - unl ike the 
reference and the event time - is always a 
s ingleton,  and i f  one of the in terva ls  involved 
is a s ingleton,  then the re la t ions  ' s ince  and 
'unt i l '  and e i ther  "during' or 'contain '  cannot 
hold by de f in i t ion .  I t  appears, thus, that both 
the de ic t i c  and the aspectual d i s t inc t ions  are 
not only mutually exclusive but also exhaustive 
within the i r  respective domains. 
Together they form the core of the temporal 
calculus. This core has to be extended in 
various ways i f  one wants to take into 
account the phenomenon of i te ra t iv i ty ,  the 
sequence of tenses in complex sentences, and 
the relevance of the event type of the basic 
proposit ion (of. Vendler's d i s t inc t ion  of 
38 
states, ac t iv i t ies ,  accomplishments, 
achievements). Part of th is  has already been 
incorporated in the formalism, but in stead 
of presenting those extensions me think i t  
more useful to round off this paper with a 
demonstration of how the calculus can be used 
for the inter l ingual  analysis of verbal 
tense forms. 
3. The inter l ingual  analysis of tenses. 
For the inter l ingual  analysis of the verbal 
tense Torms #e adopt the following pr inc ip le:  
(VII) 
The inter l ingual  representations of verbal 
tense forms are pairs consisting of one 
deict ic  and one aspectual value. 
As the number of possible combinations of 
deict ic and aspectual values is 18 (3x6), i t  
follows that each tense form can have at 
most 18 di f ferent inter l ingual  representations. 
In order to determine which values a given 
tense can actually have one has to examine 
i t s  compatibi l i ty  with the di f ferent  types of 
time adverbials. 
As for the deict ic  subpart~ i t  is not so 
d i f f i cu l t  to invent a c r i te r ion :  
( i )  
I f  tense X i s  compat ib le  wi th  a de ic t i c  
Y -adverb ia l ,  ,here  Y \[ (a f te r ,  be fore ,  
conta in} ,  then the tense X can have the 
value Y. 
For the aspectual subpart the c r i te r ia  are 
a b i t  more complicated: 
( i i )  
IT tense X can be used in a sentence with a 
when-adverbial in #hich the event is said to 
take place before or after the interval 
denoted by that when-adverbial, then the 
aspectual value of X can be either "before' 
or 'a f te r ' ,  i .e .  X can be used to express 
either retrospect iv i ty  or prospect ivity.  
( i i i~  
If tense X can be used in a sentence which 
contains both a ,hen-adverbial and a duration 
adverbial that denotes an interval that is 
larger than the interval denoted by the 
when-adverbial, then tense X can be used to 
express the durative aspect. 
Similar c r i te r ia  have to be stated for the 
other aspects (inchoative, terminative, and 
perfective).  As far as ,e can see no# the 
perfective aspect might well be considered 
to be the default value: from a conceptual 
point of vie# the least marked situation 
is the one in which the event time is contained 
in or identical  with the reference time 
(E c R or E = R). 
As an i l l us t ra t ion  of how these c r i te r ia  can 
be used in practice we give an inter l ingual  
analysis of the Dutch 'Voltooid Tegenwoordige 
Ti jd (VTT)'. This tense is expressed by the 
combination of an aux i l ia ry  ('hebben" or 
' z i jn ' )  and the perfect par t i c ip le  of a 
lexical  verb .  
The VTT can be combined with a l l  kinds of 
#hen-adverbials: 
(13) nu heb ik  her gevonden 
now-have- l - i t - found  
(14) morgen heb ik  her gevonden 
tomorrow-have- I - i t - found  
(15) gisteren heb ik het gevonden 
yesterday-have-l- it-found 
In (13) and (14) the time of event precedes 
the time denoted by resp. "nu" and "morgen"; 
hence, the aspectual value of the VTT in 
these sentences is the retrospective one. 
In fact,  (13) and (14) belong to a paradigm 
of retrospective tenses. The other members 
of the paradigm are the "goltooid Verleden 
Ti jd"  and the "Voltooid Toekomende T i jd" ,  
as in 
(Ib) gisteren had ik bet al gevonden 
yesterday-had-l- it-already-found 
(17) morgen zal ik bet gevonden hebben 
tomorrow-shall- l- it-faund-have 
(14) and (17) even have the same meaning and, 
hence, the same inter l ingual  representation, 
namely the combination after - before. 
(13) has the value contain - before, and 
(Ib) the value before - before. 
In (15) the situation is d i f ferent :  here, the 
time of finding does not precede the interval  
denoted by "yesterday" (as in ( Ib)) ,  but is 
rather contained in i t .  The aspectual value of 
the VTT in (16) is hence the perfective one, 
and the inter l ingual  representation in that case 
is before - durin 9. 
I t  can further be sho,n that the VTT cannot be 
used to express a durative aspect. Comoare 
(18) gisteren ben ik de hele dag ziek geweest 
yesterday-am-l-the-whole-day-ill-been 
(19) * gisteren ben ik drie dagen ziek geweest 
yesterday-aa-l-three-days-i l l -been 
In (18) the event time denoted by the duration 
adverbial "de hele dag" is a subset of the 
interval denoted by "gisteren" (= perfective 
aspect); in (19), on the other hand, the 
event time (three days) is said to be longer 
than the reference time (one day). Since this 
39 
combinat ion  leads to ungramaat ica l i ty  ( in  
Dutch) ,  i t  fo l lows  that  the VTT cannot express 
durat iv i ty .  
I f  these analyses are cor rect ,  i t  fo l lows  that  
the Dutch VTT can have three  d i s t inc t  in ter -  
lingual representations: contain - before, 
after - before, and before - durino. 
The general idea now is that this information 
is contained in the lexicon, and that for the 
assignment of temporal representations to 
particular sentences one f i r s t  looks in the 
lexicon to see which interl ingual representations 
the tense used in that particular sentence can 
have, and then singles out that subset of 
representations which is compatible with the 
time adverbials used in the sentence. 
I f  that  subset conta ins  exact ly  one member the 
sentence may be said to be unaebiguous w i th  
respect  to the temporal  ca lcu lus ;  i f  the subset 
contains more members, the sentence is said to 
be temporally ambiguous; and i f  the subset is 
empty, the sentbnce is simply not well-formed. 
As a conc lus ion  to  th i s  sect ion  we g ive  the 
representat ions  of some of the d iscussed 
sentences  
13) 3 S,R,E ~ t ime (conta in (R ,S )  & nu(R) & 
before(E ,R)  & AT (E, ik  her v inden) )

4. Prospects. 
In this paper we have concentrated on the 
definit ion of a conceptual calculus for the 
representation of time meanings in natural 
language. We have also given principles 
(IV,V,VI,VII) and c r i te r ia  ( i , i i , i i i )  for 
relating the concepts of the calculus to 
language specific morphosyntactic ategories. 
Given these tools, i t  should be possible to 
analyse the tenses of the different languages 
in such a way that the results of the analysis 
are comparable and, indeed, identical i f f  they 
express the same concept. 
It  goes without saying that the actual analysis 
of al l  possible tenses cannot be carried out 
in a paper of this size, but we have the 
feeling that ,e have at least cleared the 
ground for such an enterprise.
