This is the official publication of the European Association for Logic, 
Language, and Information. The scope of the journal is the logical 
and computational foundations of natural, formal, and programming 
languages, as well as the different forms of human and mechanized 
inference. It covers the logical, linguistic, and information-theoretic 
parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are 
Intensional Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and 
Belief Revision; Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and 
Linguistics; Theoretical Problems of Logic Programming and 
Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; Generalized 
Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure 
like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and 
Dynamic Semantics; Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic 
Structures. The emphasis is on the theoretical aspects of these 
areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum for researchers 
interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and 
their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas 
increasing coherence.

Natural Language and Linguistic Theory provides a forum for the 
discussion of theoretical research that pays close attention to natural 
language data, so as to provide a channel of communication between 
researchers of a variety of points of view. The journal actively seeks 
to bridge the gap between descriptive work and work of a highly 
theoretical, less empirically oriented nature. In attempting to strike 
this balance, a primary goal of the journal is to encourage work which 
makes complex language data accessible to those unfamiliar with 
the language area being studied, and work which makes complex 
theoretical positions more accessible to those working outside the 
theoretical framework under review. The journal is structured to 
include: - theoretically oriented work on the syntax, semantics, pho- 
nology and the lexicon of natural language; - interdisciplinary contri- 
butions written with theoretical inguists in mind; - surveys of recent 
theoretical developments which facilitate accessibility for a graduate 
student readership; - reactions/replies to recent papers; - brief notes, 
comments or observations concerning languages or theoretical points; 
- letters to the editors; - book reviews of important linguistics titles; 
- special topic issues.

While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine 
Translation is changing and broadening its scope of interest to 
encompass all branches of Computational Linguistics and Lan- 
guage Engineering, wherever they incorporate a MULTILINGUAL 
aspect. We therefore welcome submissions to the journal on 
THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS 
of any of the following topics: 
+ machine translation and machine-aided translation + human 
translation theory and practise + multilingual text composition and 
generation + multilingual information retrieval + multilingual natural 
language interfaces + multilingual dialogue systems + multilingual 
message understanding systems + corpus-based and statistical 
language modelling + connectionist approaches to translation 
+ compilation and use of bi- and multJlingual corpora + discourse 
phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation 
+ knowledge engineering + contrastive linguistics + morphology, 
syntax, semantics, pragmatics + computer-aided language 
instruction and learning + software localization and 
internationalization +speech processing, especially for speech 
translation + phonetics, phonology + computational implications of 
non-Roman character sets + multilingual word-processing 
+ the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well 
as linguistic aspects) + minority languages + history of machine 
translation. We would also welcome your suggestions about other 
features you would like to see in this journal, for example, special 
issues, squibs, topical comment.

Linguistics and Philosophyfocuses on issues related to structure and 
meaning in natural language, as addressed in the philosophy of 
language, linguistic seman~.ics, syntax and related disciplines, in 
particular the following areas: 
- philosophical theories of meaning and truth, reference, description, 
entailment, presupposition, implicatures, context-dependence, and 
speech acts; 
- linguistic theories of semantic interpretation in relation to syntactic 
structure and prosody, of discourse structure, lexcial semantics and 
semantic change; 
- psycholinguistic theories of semantic interpretation and issues of 
the processing and acquisition of natural language, and the relation 
of semantic interpretation to other cognitive faculties; 
- mathematical and logical properties of natural language and gen- 
eral aspects of computational linguistics; 
- philosophical questions raised by linguistics as a science: linguis- 
tics methodology, properties of linguistic theories and frameworks, 
and the relation of linguistics to other fields of inquiry. 
Contributions may be in the form of articles, replies, book reviews or 
review articles.

BENEFITS, PAYMENT AND ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS 
Please immediately notify the ACL Office of address and email changes. Journal copies returned due to bad 
addresses will not be remailed until a $5.00 postage/handling fee is remitted. E-mail (if available) is used to 
distribute meeting, membership, and other announcements. 
MEMBERSHIP in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues 
are paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at 
most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, 
fund donations, back issues, and proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. Important Note: Renewals must 
be received no later than 1 April 2001 to avoid late payment fee (for postage/handling) assessment. Membership 
categories include Regular Members (for 1, 3 or 5 years) and the following: Couples with the same mailing address 
may be Joint Members (for 1, 3, or 5 years); they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible 
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may 
become Student Members with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members because of their 
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed 
memberships. If no indication is provided of multi-year membership reference, one-year membership will be 
presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does not apply to new memberships. 
SPECIAL FUNDS: INTERNATIONAL FUND: Allows ACL memberships and publications to be available to col- 
leagues having difficulty using their national currencies or for whom membership would otherwise be impossible. 
Contributions may be tax deductible; check local regulations. Receipts are available upon request. THE DON 
AND BETTY WALKER INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FUND: This fund was set up to honor Don and Betty 
Walker. It supports elect student ravel to ACL meetings. Contributions may be tax deductible, and companies

Guidel ines for Submissions 
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer- 
ences. The paper should begin with an iriformative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. 
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact he edltor egarding the possibility of electronic 
submission. 
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: 
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com- 
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The 
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to 
forty double-spaced.pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully 
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni- 
cally; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the L TEX 
style files. The submission of an article to CL for .refereeing means that the author certifies 
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to 
another efereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non- 
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at 
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must 
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the 
case of a "work for hire," by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 
U.S. Copyright law. 
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant o the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con- 
tributions for inclusion. 
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters hould be sent to:

(+1 973) 360-8330; acl@research.att.com. 
Squibs and Discussions: This category includes hort articles reporting technical results, dis- 
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest o the 
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should 
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LTEX source, postscript or plain 
text) are welcome and should be submitted to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and 
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was 
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing 
Cdmputational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring 
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural 
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics 
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation , Computational Phonology, MulRmedia Language 
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; 
others are likely to be added.
