Abstract 
Statistical language modeling (LM) that 
purports to quantify the acceptability of a 
given piece of text has long been an in-
teresting yet challenging research area. In 
particular, language modeling for infor-
mation retrieval (IR) has enjoyed re-
markable empirical success; one emerg-
ing stream of the LM approach for IR is 
to employ the pseudo-relevance feedback 
process to enhance the representation of 
an input query so as to improve retrieval 
effectiveness. This paper presents a con-
tinuation of such a general line of re-
search and the main contribution is three-
fold. First, we propose a principled 
framework which can unify the relation-
ships among several widely-used query 
modeling formulations. Second, on top of 
the successfully developed framework, 
we propose an extended query modeling 
formulation by incorporating critical que-
ry-specific information cues to guide the 
model estimation. Third, we further adopt 
and formalize such a framework to the 
speech recognition and summarization 
tasks. A series of empirical experiments 
reveal the feasibility of such an LM 
framework and the performance merits of 
the deduced models on these two tasks. 
1 Introduction 
Along with the rapidly growing popularity of the 
Internet and the ubiquity of social web commu-
nications, tremendous volumes of multimedia 
contents, such as broadcast radio and television 
programs, digital libraries and so on, are made 
available to the public. Research on multimedia 
content understanding and organization has wit-
nessed a booming interest over the past decade. 
By virtue of the developed techniques, a variety 
of functionalities were created to help distill im-
portant content from multimedia collections, or 
provide locations of important speech segments 
in a video accompanied with their corresponding 
transcripts, for users to listen to or to digest. Sta-
tistical language modeling (LM) (Jelinek, 1999; 
Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Zhai, 2008), which 
manages to quantify the acceptability of a given 
word sequence in a natural language or capture 
the statistical characteristics of a given piece of 
text, has been proved to offer both efficient and 
effective modeling abilities in many practical 
applications of natural language processing and 
speech recognition (Ponte and Croft, 1998; Jelin-
ek, 1999; Huang, et al., 2001; Zhai and Lafferty, 
2001a; Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Furui et al., 
2012; Liu and Hakkani-Tur, 2011). 
The LM approach was first introduced for the 
information retrieval (IR) problems in the late 
1990s, indicating very good potential, and was 
subsequently extended in a wide array of follow-
up studies. One typical realization of the LM ap-
proach for IR is to access the degree of relevance 
between a query and a document by computing 
the likelihood of the query generated by the doc-
ument (usually referred to as the query-
likelihood approach) (Zhai, 2008; Baeza-Yates 
and Ribeiro-Neto, 2011). A document is deemed 
to be relevant to a given query if the correspond-
ing document model is more likely to generate 
the query. On the other hand, the Kullback-
Leibler divergence measure (denoted by KLM 
for short hereafter), which quantifies the degree 
of relevance between a document and a query 
from a more rigorous information-theoretic per-
spective, has been proposed (Lafferty and Zhai, 
2001; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b; Baeza-Yates and 
Ribeiro-Neto, 2011). KLM not only can be 
thought as a natural generalization of the query-
likelihood approach, but also has the additional 
merit of being able to accommodate extra infor-
mation cues to improve the performance of doc-
ument ranking. For example, a main challenge 
facing such a measure is that since a given query 
usually consists of few words, the true infor-
mation need is hard to be inferred from the sur-
face statistics of a query. As such, one emerging 
stream of thought for KLM is to employ the 
1474
pseudo-relevance feedback process to construct 
an enhanced query model (or representation) so 
as to achieve better retrieval effectiveness (Hi-
emstra et al., 2004; Lv and Zhai, 2009; Carpineto 
and Romano, 2012; Lee and Croft, 2013). 
Following this line of research, the major con-
tribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) we ana-
lyze several widely-used query models and then 
propose a principled framework to unify the rela-
tionships among them; 2) on top of the success-
fully developed query models, we propose an 
extended modeling formulation by incorporating 
additional query-specific information cues to 
guide the model estimation; 3) we explore a nov-
el use of these query models by adapting them to 
the speech recognition and summarization tasks. 
As we will see, a series of experiments indeed 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
models on these two tasks. 
2 Language Modeling Framework 
2.1 Kullback-Leibler Divergence Measure 
A promising realization of the LM approach to 
IR is the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure 
(KLM), which determines the degree of rele-
vance between a document and a query from a 
rigorous information-theoretic perspective. Two 
different language models are involved in KLM: 
one for the document and the other for the query. 
The divergence of the document model with re-
spect to the query model is defined by  
.)|( )|(log)|()||(KL ? ?? Vw DwP QPQwPDQ
  (1)  
KLM not only can be thought as a natural gener-
alization of the traditional query-likelihood ap-
proach (Yi and Allan, 2009; Baeza-Yates and 
Ribeiro-Neto, 2011), but also has the additional 
merit of being able to accommodate extra infor-
mation cues to improve the estimation of its 
component models in a systematic way for better 
document ranking (Zhai, 2008).  
Due to that a query usually consists of only a 
few words, the true query model P(w|Q)
 
might 
not be accurately estimated by the simple ML 
estimator (Jelinek, 1991). There are several stud-
ies devoted to estimating a more accurate query 
modeling, saying that it can be approached with 
the pseudo-relevance feedback process (Lavren-
ko and Croft, 2001; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b). 
However, the success depends largely on the as-
sumption that the set of top-ranked documents, 
DTop={D1,D2,...,Dr,...}, obtained from an initial 
round of retrieval, are relevant and can be used to 
estimate a more accurate query language model. 
2.2 Relevance Modeling  
Under the notion of relevance modeling (RM, 
often referred to as RM-1), each query Q is as-
sumed to be associated with an unknown rele-
vance class RQ, and documents that are relevant 
to the semantic content expressed in query are 
samples drawn from the relevance class RQ. 
Since there is no prior knowledge about RQ, we 
may use the top-ranked documents DTop to ap-
proximate the relevance class RQ. The corre-
sponding relevance model can be estimated using 
the following equation (Lavrenko and Croft, 
2001; Lavrenko, 2004):

2.3 Simple Mixture Model 
Another perspective of estimating an accurate 
query model with the top-ranked documents is 
the simple mixture model (SMM), which as-
sumes that words in DTop are drawn from a two-
component mixture model: 1) One component is 
the query-specific topic model PSMM(w|Q), and 2) 
the other is a generic background model 
P(w|BG). By doing so, the SMM model 
PSMM(w|Q) can be estimated by maximizing the 
likelihood over all the top-ranked documents 
(Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b; Tao and Zhai, 2006): 
? ? ,)|()1()|( ),(SMM?? ?? ????? Topr rD Vw DwcBGwPQwPL D ??
(3) 
where ?  is a pre-defined weighting parameter 
used to control the degree of reliance between 
PSMM(w|Q) and P(w|BG). This estimation will 
enable more specific words to receive more 
probability mass, thereby leading to a more dis-
criminative query model PSMM(w|Q). 
Although the SMM modeling aims to extract 
extra word usage cues for enhanced query mod-
eling, it may confront two intrinsic problems. 
One is the extraction of word usage cues from 
DTop is not guided by the original query. The oth-
er is that the mixing coefficient ?  is fixed across 
all top-ranked documents albeit that different 
documents would potentially contribute different 
amounts of word usage cues to the enhanced 
query model. To mitigate these two problems, 
the regularized simple mixture model has been 
proposed and can be estimated by maximizing 
the likelihood function (Tao and Zhai, 2006; Dil-
lon and Collins-Thompson, 2010)

3 The Proposed Modeling Framework 
3.1 Fundamentals 
It is obvious that the major difference among the 
1475
representative query models mentioned above is 
how to capitalize on the set of top-ranked docu-
ments and the original query. Several subtle rela-
tionships can be deduced through the following 
in-depth analysis. First, a direct inspiration of the 
LM-based query reformulation framework can 
be drawn from the celebrated Rocchio’s formula-
tion, while the former can be viewed as a proba-
bilistic counterpart of the latter (Robertson, 1990; 
Ponte and Croft, 1998; Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-
Neto, 2011). Second, after some mathematical 
manipulation, the formulation of the RM model 
(c.f. Eq. (2)) can be rewritten as 
.)()|(

rrr DPDQP
DPDQPDwPQwP D D
(5) 
It becomes evident that the RM model is com-
posed by mixing a set of document models 
P(w|Dr). As such, the RM model bears a close 
resemblance to the Rocchio’s formulation. Fur-
thermore, based on Eq. (5), we can recast the 
estimation of the RM model as an optimization 
problem, and the likelihood (or objective) func-
tion is formulated as

where the document models P(w|Dr) are known 
in advance; the conditional probability P(Dr|Q) 
of each document Dr is unknown and leave to be 
estimated. Finally, a principled framework can 
be obtained to unify all of these query models, 
including RM (c.f. Eq. (6)), SMM (c.f. Eq. (3)) 
and RSMM (c.f. Eq. (4))), by using a generalized 
objective likelihood function:

where E represents a set of observations which 
we want to maximize their likelihood, and M 
denotes a set of mixture components.  
3.2 Query-specific Mixture Modeling 
The SMM model and the RSMM model are in-
tended to extract useful word usage cues from 
DTop, which are not only relevant to the original 
query Q but also external to those already cap-
tured by the generic background model. Howev-
er, we argue in this paper that the “generic in-
formation” should be carefully crafted for each 
query due mainly to the fact that users’ infor-
mation needs may be very diverse from one an-
other. To crystallize the idea, a query-specific 
background model PQ(w|BG) for each query Q 
can be derived from DTop directly. Another con-
sideration is that since the original query model 
P(w|Q) cannot be accurately estimated, it thus 
may not necessarily be the best choice for use in 
defining a conjugate Dirichlet prior for the en-
hanced query model to be estimated. We propose 
to use the RM model as a prior to guide the esti-
mation of the enhanced query model. The en-
hanced query model is termed query-specific 
mixture model (QMM), and its corresponding 
training objective function can be expressed as

4 Applications 
4.1 Speech Recognition 
Language modeling is a critical and integral 
component in any large vocabulary continuous 
speech recognition (LVCSR) system (Huang et 
al., 2001; Jurafsky and Martin, 2008; Furui et al., 
2012). More concretely, the role of language 
modeling in LVCSR can be interpreted as calcu-
lating the conditional probability P(w|H), in 
which H is a search history, usually expressed as 
a sequence of words H=h1, h2,…, hL, and w is 
one of its possible immediately succeeding 
words. Once the various aforementioned query 
modeling methods are applied to speech recogni-
tion, for a search history H, we can conceptually 
regard it as a query and each of its immediately 
succeeding words w as a (single-word) document. 
Then, we may leverage an IR procedure that 
takes H as a query and poses it to a retrieval sys-
tem to obtain a set of top-ranked documents from 
a contemporaneous (or in-domain) corpus. Final-
ly, the enhanced query model (that is P(w|H) in 
speech recognition) can be estimated by RM, 
SMM, RSMM or QM , and further combined 
with the background n-gram (e.g., trigram) lan-
guage model to form an adaptive language model 
to guide the speech recognition process. 
4.2 Speech Summarization 
On the other hand, extractive speech summariza-
tion aims at producing a concise summary by 
selecting salient sentences or paragraphs from 
the original spoken document according to a pre-
defined target summarization ratio (Carbonell 
and Goldstein, 1998; Mani and Maybury, 1999; 
Nenkova and McKeown, 2011; Liu and 
Hakkani-Tur, 2011). Intuitively, this task could 
be framed as an ad-hoc IR problem, where the 
spoken document is treated as an information 
need and each sentence of the document is re-
garded as a candidate information unit to be re-
trieved according to its relevance to the infor-
mation need. Therefore, KLM can be used to 
quantify how close the document D and one of 
its sentences S are: the closer the sentence model 
P(w|S) to the document model P(w|D), the more 
1476
likely the sentence would be part of the summary. 
Due to that each sentence S of a spoken docu-
ment D to be summarized usually consists of 
only a few words, the corresponding sentence 
model P(w|S) might not be appropriately esti-
mated by the ML estimation. To alleviate the 
deficiency, we can leverage the merit of the 
above query modeling techniques to estimate an 
accurate sentence model for each sentence to 
enhance the summarization performance. 
5 Experimental Setup 
The speech corpus consists of about 196 hours of 
Mandarin broadcast news collected by the Aca-
demia Sinica and the Public Television Service 
Foundation of Taiwan between November 2001 
and April 2003 (Wang et al., 2005), which is 
publicly available and has been segmented into 
separate stories and transcribed manually. Each 
story contains the speech of one studio anchor, as 
well as several field reporters and interviewees. 
A subset of 25-hour speech data compiled during 
November 2001 to December 2002 was used to 
bootstrap the acoustic model training. The vo-
cabulary size is about 72 thousand words. The 
background language model was estimated from 
a background text corpus consisting of 170 mil-
lion Chinese characters collected from the Chi-
nese Gigaword Corpus released by LDC. 
The dataset for use in the speech recognition 
experiments is compiled by a subset of 3-hour 
speech data from the corpus within 2003 (1.5 
hours for development and 1.5 hours for test). 
The contemporaneous (in-domain) text corpus 
used for training the various LM adaptation 
methods was collected between 2001 and 2003 
from the corpus (excluding the test set), which 
consists of one million Chinese characters of the 
orthographic broadcast news transcripts. In this 
paper, all the LM adaptation experiments were 
performed in word graph rescoring. The associ-
ated word graphs of the speech data were built 
beforehand with a typical LVCSR system (Ort-
manns et al., 1997; Young et al., 2006). 
In addition, the summarization task also em-
ploys the same broadcast news corpus as well. A 
subset of 205 broadcast news documents com-
piled between November 2001 and August 2002 
was reserved for the summarization experiments 
(185 for development and 20 for test). A subset 
of about 100,000 text news documents, compiled 
during the same period as the documents to be 
summarized, was employed to estimate the relat-
ed summarization models compared in this paper. 
We adopted three variants of the widely-used 
ROUGE metric (i.e., ROUGE-1, ROGUE-2 and 
ROUGE-L) for the assessment of summarization 
performance (Lin, 2003). The summarization 
ratio, defined as the ratio of the number of words 
in the automatic (or manual) summary to that in 
the reference transcript of a spoken document, 
was set to 10% in this research. 
6 Experimental Results 
In the first part of experiments, we evaluate the 
effectiveness of the various query models applied 
to the speech recognition task. The correspond-
ing results with respect to different numbers of 
top-ranked documents being used for estimating 
their component models are shown in Table 1. 
Also worth mentioning is that the baseline sys-
tem with the background trigram language model, 
which was trained with the SRILM toolkit 
(Stolcke, 2005) and Good-Turing smoothing 
(Jelinek, 1999), results in a Chinese character 
error rate (CER) of 20.08% on the test set. Con-
sulting Table 1 we notice two particularities. One 
is that there is more fluctuation in the CER re-
sults of SMM than in those of RM. The reason 
might be that, for SMM, the extraction of rele-
vance information from the top-ranked docu-
ments is conducted with no involvement of the 
test utterance (i.e., the query; or its correspond-
ing search histories), as elaborated earlier in Sec-
tion 2. When too many feedback documents are 
being used, there would be a concern for SMM 
to be distracted from being able to appropriate 
model the test utterance, which is probably 
caused by some dominant distracting (or irrele-
vant) feedback documents. The other interesting 
observation is that RSMM only achieves a com-
parable (even worse) result when compared to 
SMM. A possible reason is that the prior con-
straint of the RSMM may contain too much 
noisy information so as to bias the model estima-
tion. Furthermore, it is evident that the proposed 
QMM is the best-performing method among all 
the query models compared in the paper. Alt-
hough the improvements made by QMM are not 
as pronounced as expected, we believe that 
QMM has demonstrated its potential to be ap-
plied to other related applications. On the other 
hand, we compare the various query models with 
two well-practiced language models, namely the 
cache model (Cache) (Kuhn and Mori, 1990; 
Jelinek et al., 1991) and the latent Dirichlet allo-
cation (LDA) (Liu and Liu, 2007; Tam and 
Schultz, 2005). The CER results of these two 
models are also shown in Table 1, respectively. 
For the cache model, bigram cache was used 
since it can yield better results than the unigram 
and trigram cache models in our experiments. It 
is worthy to notice that the LDA model was 
trained with the entire set of contemporaneous 
text document collection (c.f. Section 4), while 
all of the query models explored in the paper 
were estimated based on a subset of the corpus 
selected by an initial round of retrieval. The re-
sults reveal that most of these query models can 
achieve superior performance over the two con-
ventional language models. 
1477
In the second part of experiments, we evaluate 
the utilities of the various query models as ap-
plied to the speech summarization task. At the 
outset, we assess the performance level of the 
baseline KLM method by comparison with two 
well-practiced unsupervised methods, viz. the 
vector space model (VSM) (Gong and Liu, 2001), 
and its extension, maximal marginal relevance 
(MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998). The 
corresponding results are shown in Table 2 and 
can be aligned with several related literature re-
views. By looking at the results, we find that 
KLM outperforms VSM by a large margin, con-
firming the applicability of the language model-
ing framework for speech summarization. Fur-
thermore, MMR that presents an extension of 
VSM performs on par with KLM for the text 
summarization task (TD) and exhibits superior 
performance over KLM for the speech summari-
zation task (SD). We now turn to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the various query models (viz. 
RM, SMM, RSMM and QMM) in conjunction 
with the pseudo-relevance feedback process for 
enhancing the sentence model involved in the 
KLM method. The corresponding results are also 
shown in Table 2. Two noteworthy observations 
can be drawn from Table 2. One is that all these 
query models can considerably improve the 
summarization performance of the KLM method, 
which corroborates the advantage of using them 
for enhanced sentence representations. The other 
is that QMM is the best-performing one among 
all the formulations studied in this paper for both 
the TD and SD cases.  
Going one step further, we explore to use extra 
prosodic features that are deemed complemen-
tary to the LM cue provided by QMM for speech 
summarization. To this end, a support vector ma-
chine (SVM) based summarization model is 
trained to integrate a set of 28 commonly-used 
prosodic features (Liu and Hakkani-Tur, 2011) 
for representing each spoken sentence, since 
SVM is arguably one of the state-of-the-art su-
pervised methods that can make use of a diversi-
ty of indicative features for text or speech sum-
marization (Xie and Liu, 2010; Chen et al., 
2013). The sentence ranking scores derived by 
QMM and SVM are in turn integrated through a 
simple log-linear combination. The correspond-
ing results are shown in Table 2, demonstrating 
consistent improvements with respect to all the 
three variants of the ROUGE metric as compared 
to that using either QMM or SVM in isolation. 
We also investigate using SVM to additionally 
integrate a richer set of lexical and relevance fea-
tures to complement QMM and further enhance 
the summarization effectiveness. However, due 
to space limitation, we omit the details here. As a 
side note, there is a sizable gap between the TD 
and SD cases, indicating room for further im-
provements. We may seek remedies, such as ro-
bust indexing schemes, to compensate for imper-
fect speech recognition. 
7 Conclusion and Outlook 
In this paper, we have presented a systematic and 
thorough analysis of a few well-practiced query 
models for IR and extended their novel applica-
bility to speech recognition and summarization in 
a principled way. Furthermore, we have pro-
posed an extension of this research line by intro-
ducing query-specific mixture modeling; the util-
ities of the deduced model have been extensively 
compared with several existing query models. As 
to future work, we would like to investigate 
jointly integrating proximity and other different 
kinds of relevance and lexical/semantic infor-
mation cues into the process of feedback docu-
ment selection so as to improve the empirical 
effectiveness of such query modeling.
