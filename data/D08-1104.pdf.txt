Abstract
Some phrases can be interpreted either id-
iomatically (figuratively) or literally in con-
text, and the precise identification of idioms
is indispensable for full-fledged natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). To this end, we have
constructed an idiom corpus for Japanese.
This paper reports on the corpus and the re-
sults of an idiom identification experiment us-
ing the corpus. The corpus targets 146 am-
biguous idioms, and consists of 102,846 sen-
tences, each of which is annotated with a lit-
eral/idiom label. For idiom identification, we
targeted 90 out of the 146 idioms and adopted
a word sense disambiguation (WSD) method
using both common WSD features and idiom-
specific features. The corpus and the experi-
ment are the largest of their kind, as far as we
know. As a result, we found that a standard
supervised WSD method works well for the
idiom identification and achieved an accuracy
of 89.25% and 88.86% with/without idiom-
specific features and that the most effective
idiom-specific feature is the one involving the
adjacency of idiom constituents.
1 Introduction
Some phrases like kick the bucket are ambiguous
with regard to whether they carry literal or idiomatic
meaning in a certain context. This ambiguity needs
to be resolved in the same manner as ambiguous
words that have been dealt with in the WSD liter-
ature. We term the resolution of the literal/idiomatic
ambiguity as idiom identification, hereafter.
Idiom identification is classified into two kinds;
one is for idiom types and the other is for idiom to-
kens. With the former, phrases that can be inter-
preted as idioms are found in text corpora, typically
for compiling idiom dictionaries. On the other hand,
the latter helps identify a phrase in context as a true
idiom or a phrase that should be interpreted literally
(a literal phrase, henceforth). In this paper, we deal
with the latter, i.e., idiom token identification.
Despite the recent enthusiasm for multiword ex-
pressions (MWEs) (Gre´goire et al., 2007; Gre´goire
et al., 2008), the idiom token identification is in an
early phase of its development. Given that many
NLP tasks like machine translation or parsing have
been developed as a result of the availability of lan-
guage resources, idiom token identification should
also be developed when adequate idiom resources
are provided. To this end, we have constructed a
Japanese idiom corpus. We have also conducted
an idiom identification experiment using the corpus
that we hope will be a good reference point for fu-
ture studies on the task. We drew on a standard
WSD framework with machine learning exploiting
both features commonly used in the WSD studies
and idiom-specific features. This paper reports in
detail the corpus and the result of the experiment;
herein, it must be noted that to the best of our knowl-
edge, the corpus and the experiment are the largest
ever of their kind.
We only deal with the ambiguity between lit-
eral and idiomatic interpretations. However, some
phrases have two or more idiomatic meanings with-
out context. For example, a Japanese idiom te-o
dasu (hand-ACC stretch)1 can be interpreted as ei-
1ACC is the accusative case marker. Likewise we use the
following notation in this paper; NOM for the nominative case
992
ther “punch,” “steal” or “make moves on.” This kind
of ambiguity should be placed on the agenda.
We do not tackle the problem of what constitutes
the notion of “idiom.” We simply regard phrases
listed in Sato (2007) as idioms.
The reminder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In §2 we present related works. §3 shows the
target idioms. After the idiom corpus is described
in §4, we detail our idiom identification method and
experiment in §5. Finally §6 concludes the paper.
2 Related Work
There have only been a few works on the con-
struction of an idiom corpus. In this regard, Birke
and Sarkar (2006) and Cook et al. (2008) are no-
table exceptions. Birke and Sarkar (2006) auto-
matically constructed a corpus of English idiomatic
expressions (words that can be used non-literally).
They targeted 50 expressions and collected about
6,600 examples. They call the corpus TroFi Exam-
ple Base, which is available on the Web.2 Cook
et al. (2008) compiled a corpus of English verb-
noun combinations (VNCs) tokens. Their corpus
deals with 53 VNC expressions and consists of about
3,000 example sentences. Like ours, they assigned
each example with a label indicating whether an ex-
pression in the example is used literally or idiomati-
cally. Our corpus can be regarded as the Japanese
idiom counterpart of these works. However, note
that our corpus targets 146 idioms and consists of
as many as 102,846 example sentences. Another ex-
ception is Tsuchiya et al. (2006), who manually con-
structed an example database of Japanese compound
functional expressions named MUST. They provide
it on the Web.3 Some of the compound functional
expressions in Japanese are ambiguous like idioms
are.4
marker, DAT for the dative case marker, and GEN for the genitive
case marker. FROM and TO stand for the Japanese counterparts
of from and to. NEG represents a verbal negation morpheme.
2http://www.cs.sfu.ca/?anoop/students/jbirke/
3http://nlp.iit.tsukuba.ac.jp/must/
4For example, (something)-ni-atatte ((something)-DAT-
run.into) means either “run into (something)” or “on the occa-
sion of (something).” The former is the literal interpretation and
the latter is the idiomatic interpretation of the compound func-
tional expression.
The SAID dataset5 provides data about the syn-
tactic flexibility of English idioms. It does not con-
cern itself with idiom token identification. How-
ever, as in Hashimoto et al. (2006b), Hashimoto et
al. (2006a) and Cook et al. (2007) among others, the
syntactic behavior of idioms is an important clue to
idiom token identification.
Previous studies have mostly focused on the id-
iom type identification (Lin, 1999; Krenn and Evert,
2001; Baldwin et al., 2003; Shudo et al., 2004; Fa-
zly and Stevenson, 2006). However, there has been a
growing interest in idiom token identification in re-
cent times (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Hashimoto
et al., 2006b; Hashimoto et al., 2006a; Birke and
Sarkar, 2006; Cook et al., 2007). Katz and Gies-
brecht (2006) compared the word vector of an id-
iom in context and that of the constituent words of
the idiom using LSA in order to determine if the
expression is idiomatic. Hashimoto et al. (2006b)
and Hashimoto et al. (2006a) (HSU henceforth) fo-
cused their attention on the differences in gram-
matical constraints imposed on idioms and their lit-
eral counterparts such as the possibility of passiviza-
tion, and developed handcrafted rules for Japanese
idiom identification. Although their task is ex-
actly the same as ours and we draw on the gram-
matical knowledge provided by them, the scale of
their experiment is very small, since only 108 sen-
tences were used for idiom identification in their pa-
per. Further, unlike HSU, we employ matured WSD
technologies. Cook et al. (2007) (CFS henceforth)
propose an unsupervised method for English on the
basis of the observation that idioms tend to be ex-
pressed in a small number of fixed forms.
These studies used only the characteristics of id-
ioms (or MWEs). On the other hand, we exploit
a WSD method, for which there have been many
studies and matured technologies, in addition to the
characteristics of idioms. Birke and Sarkar (2006)
also used WSD. However, they employed an unsu-
pervised method, while ours is a completely super-
vised one.
Apart from idioms, Uchiyama et al. (2005) con-
ducted the token classification of Japanese com-
pound verbs exploiting supervised method.

3 Target Idioms
For this study, we selected 146 idioms through the
following procedure. 1 We extracted basic idioms
from Sato (2007). Sato compiled about 3,600 basic
idioms of Japanese from five books: two dictionaries
for elementary school, two idiom dictionaries, and
one linguistics book on idioms. We extracted those
idioms that were described in more than two of these
five books. The total number of such idioms added
up to 926. 2 From among these idioms, we chose
ambiguous ones.6 As a result, 146 idioms were se-
lected.
As for 2 , sometimes it is not trivial to determine
if an idiom is ambiguous or not. Some idioms are
rarely interpreted literally, while others, in all likeli-
hood, take on the literal meaning. Is it meaningful to
regard them as ambiguous and deal with them in this
study? If not, how does one assuredly distinguish
truly ambiguous idioms from those that are mostly
interpreted either literally or figuratively? This can
only be done if there is an accurate idiom identifica-
tion system.
After all, we asked two native speakers of
Japanese (Group A) to classify idioms into two
classes: 1) truly ambiguous ones and 2) completely
unambiguous or practically unambiguous ones. On
the basis of the classification, one of the authors
made final judgments.
To verify how stable this ambiguity endorsement
was, we asked another two other native speakers
of Japanese (Group B) to perform the same task
and calculated the Kappa statistic between the two
speakers. First, we sampled 101 idioms from the 926
chosen earlier. Then, the two members of Group B
classified the sampled idioms into the two classes.
The Kappa statistic was found to be 0.6576, which
indicates middling stability.
Tables 2 and 3 list some of the target idioms.
4 Idiom Corpus
4.1 Corpus Specification
The corpus is designed for the idiom token iden-
tification task. That is, each example sentence in
the corpus is annotated with a label that indicates
6Some idioms like by and large do not have a literal mean-
ing. They are not dealt with in this paper.
whether the corresponding phrase in the example is
used as an idiom or a literal phrase. We call the for-
mer the positive example and the latter the negative
example. More specifically, the corpus consists of
lines that each represent one example. A line con-
sists of four fields as follows: 1 Label indicates
whether the example is positive or negative. Label i
is used for positive examples and l for negative ones.
2 ID denotes the idiom that is included in the exam-
ple. In this study, each idiom has a unique num-
ber, which is based on Sato (2007). 3 Lemma also
shows the idiom in the example. We assigned each
idiom its canonical (or standard) form on the basis
of Sato (2007). 4 Example is the example itself.
Given below is a sample of a negative example of
goma-o suru (sesame-ACC crush) ’flatter’.
• l 1417 ™?? ??™?? · · ·
The third field is the lemma of the idiom. The last
one is the example that says ’crushing sesame in a
mortar...’
Before working on the corpus construction, we
prepared a reference by which human annotators
could consistently distinguish between the literal
and figurative meanings of idioms. To be more pre-
cise, this reference specified literal and idiomatic
meanings for each idiom like dictionaries do. For
example, the entry for goma-o suru in the reference
is as follows.
Idiom: To flatter people.
Literal: To crush sesame.
As for the corpus size, we continued to anno-
tate examples for each idiom, regardless of the pro-
portion of idioms and literal phrases, until the total
number of examples for each idiom reached 1,000.7
In the case of a shortage of original data, we anno-
tated as many examples as possible. The original
data were sourced from the Japanese Web corpus
(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2006).
4.2 Corpus Construction
We constructed the corpus in the following man-
ner: 1 From the Web corpus, we collected exam-
ple sentences that contained one of our target id-
ioms whichever meaning (positive or negative) they
7For idioms that we sampled for preliminary annotation, we
annotated more than 1,000 examples.

take on. Concretely speaking, we automatically col-
lected sentences in which constituent words of one
of our targets appeared in a canonical dependency
relationship by using KNP8, a Japanese dependency
parser. 2 We classified the collected examples as
positive and negative. This was done by human an-
notators and was based on the reference to distin-
guish the two meanings. For annotation, longer ex-
amples were given higher priority than shorter ex-
amples. Note that we discarded examples that were
collected by mistake due to dependency parsing er-
rors and those that lacked a context that could help
them be interpreted correctly.
This was done by the two members of Group A
and took 230 hours.
4.3 Status of Corpus
The corpus consists of 102,846 examples.9 Figure
1 shows the distribution of the number of examples.
For 68 idioms, we annotated more than 1,000 exam-
ples. However, we annotated less than 100 examples
for 17 idioms because of inadequate original data.
The average number of words in a sentence is 46.

Figure 2: Distribution of sentence length
you see, our corpus contains many more long sen-
tences. This is because longer sentences were given
priority for annotation, as stated in §4.2. Figure 3
shows the longest and shortest examples each for lit-
eral and idiomatic meanings of goma-o suru drawn
from the corpus.
To determine how consistent the positive/negative
annotation is across different human annotators, we
sampled 1,421 examples from the corpus, asked the
two members of Group B to do the same annota-
tion, and calculated the Kappa statistic between the
two. The value was 0.8519, which indicates very
high agreement.
The corpus is available on the Web.10 Currently
we provide the list of the basic Japanese idioms we
are dealing with, the idiom corpus, and the vector
representation data used for the idiom identification
experiment. The corpus is protected under the BSD
license.
5 Idiom Identification Experiment
5.1 Method of Idiom Identification
We adopted a standard WSD method using machine
learning. More specifically, we used SVM (Vap-
nik, 1995) with a quadratic kernel implemented in
TinySVM.11 The features we used are classified into
either those that have been commonly used in WSD
on the lines of Lee and Ng (2002) (LN hereafter),

We used JUMAN,14 a morphological analyzer of
Japanese, and KNP to extract these features.

f2 and f3 are the same as those described in LN.
But f1 is slightly different in that we did not use the
P0 of LN. f4 and f5 roughly correspond to the syn-
tactic relations of LN. We adapted it to Japanese id-
ioms along with some simplifications. In the case of
the example ofmune-o utu (chest-ACC hit) ‘impress’
below,15 f4 is the POS and lemma of tyousyu and f5
corresponds to those of uta.16

‘A beautiful song that impresses the audience’
f6 and f7 are available from JUMAN’s output.
For example, the hypernym of tyousyu (audience)
is human and its domain is culture/media.
Those of uta (song) are abstract-thing and
culture/recreation. They are not used in
LN, but they are known to be useful for WSD
(Tanaka et al., 2007; Magnini et al., 2002).
f8 indicates whether a nominal constituent of an
idiom, if any, undergoes adnominal modification. f9
indicates whether one of Japanese topic case mark-
ers is attached to a nominal constituent of an idiom,
if any. f10 is turned on when a passive or causative
suffix is attached to a verbal constituent of an idiom,
if any.17 f11 and f12 are similar to f10. The former
is used for negated forms and the latter for volitional
modality suffixes of a predicate part of an idiom, if
any.18 Volitional modality includes expressions like
order, request, permission, prohibition, and volition.
Finally, f13 indicates whether the constituents of an
idiom is adjacent to each other.
As discussed in HSU, the idiom-specific fea-
tures are effective to distinguish idioms from lit-
eral phrases. For example, the idiom goma-o suru
does not allow adnominal modification, while its lit-
eral counterpart does. Similarly, the idiom mune-o
utu cannot take volitional modality unlike its literal
counterpart.
15The arrows indicate dependency relations.
16Functional words attaching to either the f4 word or the f5
word are ignored. In the example, no (GEN) is ignored.
17Passivization is indicated by the suffix (r)are in Japanese.
But the same suffix is also used for honorification, potentials
and spontaneous potentials. Since it is beyond the current tech-
nology, we gave up distinguishing them.
18Note that f10, f11 and f12 are applied to only those idioms
that can be used as predicates.
5.2 Experimental Condition
In the experiment, we dealt with 90 idioms for which
more than 50 examples for both idiomatic and literal
usages were available.19 We conducted experiments
for each idiom.
The performance measure is the accuracy.
Accuracy =
# of examples correctly identified
# of all example
The baseline system uniformly regards all ex-
amples as either positive or negative depending on
which is more dominant in the idiom corpus. Natu-
rally, this is prepared for each idiom.
Baseline =
max(# of positive, # of negative)
# of all example
The accuracy and the baseline accuracy for each
idiom are calculated in a 10-fold cross validation
style; we split examples of an idiom into 10 pieces
in advance of the experiment.
Also, we calculated the overall accuracy and
baseline accuracy from the individual results. We
summed up all accuracy scores of all the 90 idioms
and then divided it by 90, which is called the macro-
average. We did this for the baseline accuracy, too.
Another performance measure is the relative error
reduction (RER).20
RER =
ER of baseline ? ER of system
ER of baseline
The overall RER is calculated from the overall ac-
curacy and baseline by the above formula.
5.3 Experimental Result
Table 1 shows the overall performance. The first col-
umn is the baseline accuracy (%). The second col-
umn is the accuracy (%) and relative error reduction
(%) of the system without the idiom-specific fea-
tures. The third column is those of the system with
the idiom features. Tables 2 and 3 show the individ-
ual results of the 90 idioms. The first column shows
19Some examples were unavailable due to the feature extrac-
tion failure. Thus, examples used for the experiment are fewer
in number than those included in the corpus.
20ER stands for Error Rate in the formula.

the target idioms. The second column shows base-
line accuracy (%) and the numbers of positive and
negative examples for each idiom. The accuracy (%)
and relative error reduction (%) of the system with-
out the idiom-specific features are described in the
third column. The fourth column is those of the sys-
tem with the idiom features. Bold face indicates a
better performance.
All in all, we see relatively high baseline perfor-
mances. Nevertheless, both systems outperformed
the baseline. Especially, the system without the
idiom-specific features has a noticeable lead over the
baseline, showing that WSD technologies are effec-
tive in the idiom identification. Incorporating the id-
iom features into the system improved the overall
performance, which is statistically significant (Mc-
Nemar test, p<0.01). But performances of some id-
ioms slightly degraded by the incorporation of the
idiom features.

Table 4 shows overall results without using one of
the idiom features.21 As you see, the adjacency flag
(f13) contributes to idiom identification accuracy the
most.22 On the other hand, the adnominal modifica-
tion flag (f8) contributes to the task only slightly.23
21The first row shows the result with all idiom features used,
just for ease of reference.
22Note that greater performance drop indicates greater con-
tribution.
23This result is inconsistent with the result obtained in HSU,
where they reported that grammatical constraints involving ad-
nominal modification was most effective. This inconsistency
might be attributed to the differences of datasets being used for
idiom identification experiment. HSU used only 108 sentences
999

Table 5 shows the results reported in CFS. Their
baseline system regards all instances as idioms. The
performance of the supervised one is obtained by the
method of Katz and Giesbrecht (2006). Though we
cannot simply compare this with our results due to
the difference in experimental conditions, this im-
plies that our WSD-based method was equally good
or possibly better than their methods that are tailored
to MWEs.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we reported on the idiom corpus we
have constructed and the idiom identification exper-
iment using the corpus.
As mentioned in §4.3, some idioms are short of
examples in the current idiom corpus. We plan to
collect more examples by using different characters.
In the Japanese language, there are basically three
character systems: Hiragana, Katakana, and Chinese
characters. Thus, you can write an idiom in different
characters. For example, mune-o utu (chest-ACC hit)
‘impress’ can be either???? or??? .
In spite of its imperfection, we are sure that we
can learn a lot about the idiom identification from
the corpus, since, as far as we know, it is the largest-
ever one, and so is the idiom identification experi-
ment reported in §5.
Also, we showed that a standard supervised WSD
method works well for the idiom identification.
Our system achieved the accuracy of 89.25% and
88.86% with/without idiom-specific features.
Though we dealt with as many as 90 idioms, prac-
tical NLP systems are required to deal with many
more idioms. Toward a scalable idiom identifica-
tion, we have to develop an unsupervised or semi-
supervised method. The unsupervised method of
for the experiment, while 75,011 sentences were used for our
experiment. Also, the dataset of HSU came from newspaper
articles, while our dataset came from the web.
Birke and Sarkar (2006) requires WordNet. Fortu-
nately, the Japanese WordNet is now available (Isa-
hara et al., 2008), thus we can try their method.
Also, CFS propose a language-independent unsu-
pervised method. These could be of help.
At any rate, our idiom corpus will play an im-
portant role in the development of unsupervised or
semi-supervised methods, and the experimental re-
sults obtained in this study will be a good reference
point to evaluate those methods.
