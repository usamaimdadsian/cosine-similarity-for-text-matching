Abstract 
FoG currently produces bilingual marine 
and public weather forecasts at several 
Canadian weather offices. The system 
is engineered to reflect "good professional 
style" as found in human forecasts. How- 
ever, some regularization and simplifica- 
tion of the output has been needed. Sub- 
language ngineering issues include trade- 
offs in coverage and style, handling varia- 
tion and evolution of sublanguages, "leg- 
islating" lexical semantics and assuring a 
language model able to accomodate new 
text types and support spoken output. 
1 Background and System Overview 
FoG (for Forecast Generator) was developed ur- 
ing 1985-89 (Kittredge t al., 1986; Bourbeau et al., 
1990). After tests at Environment Canada during 
1989-91, FoG entered regular use during 1991-92, 
first for marine forecasts, and more recently for pub- 
lic forecasts. Forty percent of the operational marine 
forecasts (roughly half of all marine forecast text) in 
Canada is now produced using FoG. 
Meteorologists have been very receptive to using 
FoG, which is now a "back-end" facility of the FPA 
graphics workstation. The FPA supports the graph- 
ical analysis of weather while providing the rule- 
based concept formation eeded to drive both text 
generation and non-linguistic applications. Meteo- 
rologists now concentrate on weather analysis and 
give less thought o how forecasts hould be verbal- 
ized. Still, it has taken much time and effort to fit 
text generation i to their work environment, and re- 
spond to new requirements. Operational experience 
has shown that some linguistic refinements first pro- 
posed during design were of low priority to users, 
compared with other features which were not origi- 
nally anticipated. 
Early work on FoG set up a specialized sublan- 
guage grammar for marine forecasts, based on anal- 
ysis of more than 100,000 words of archived En- 
glish text. Corpus analysis of each forecast ype has 
been supplemented byinterviews and other means to 
check validity of categorizations and rules. In con- 
trast to earlier work on machine translation (TAUM- 
METEO), where sublanguage grammars had to be 
relatively complete to recognize ach possible hu- 
man input text, generation of forecasts from con- 
cepts provides an opportunity to "engineer out" in- 
frequent words and sentence patterns as long as each 
intended text content coming into the text planner 
is sayable in good quality text. The simplification 
and regularization of sublanguage grammars raises 
questions for engineering design. We are no longer 
just engineering the system to fit the sublanguage, 
but also engineering the output sublanguage itself to 
achieve goals such as simplicity (without significant 
loss of expressiveness) and clarity. 
Different types of forecasts have differences in 
word usage, grammatical patterns and text struc- 
ture, but the similarities are strong enough for them 
to be treated withing the same grammatical frame- 
work. This means that they require different ext 
planners (and lexicons), but can use similar gram- 
matical realizers. Significantly, English and French 
forecasts issued in Canada use the same principles 
for determining sentence boundaries, ordering and 
combining clauses, and formatting the output text. 
This greatly simplifies the problem of bilingual fore- 
cast generation i FoG. 
FoG uses three major stages to compose forecasts: 
(1) graphically mediated content determination, (2) 
text planning resulting in interlingual forms, and 
(3) realization of English and French texts from 
the interlingua. Details are given in (Kittredge and 
215 
Polgu~re, 1991) and (Goldberg et al., 1994). 
2 Sublanguage Engineering Issues 
Early corpus analysis of marine forecasts identi- 
fied a few kinds of information which were be- 
ing conveyed with high frequency, as well as a 
"mixed bag" of phenomena ofmuch lower frequency 
(e.g., WINDS HIGHER IN FJORDS and FOG LIFTING 
AS WINDS GRADUALLY INCREASE in Arctic regions). 
It was decided not to generate those sentence types 
requiring deep meteorological reasoning, to avoid 
high implementation cost. Over time, however, 
there has been some pressure to convey low fre- 
quency information which has significant value for 
marine safety (e.g., unexpectedly high winds in Arc- 
tic fjords). Use of a corpus has facilitated bringing 
low-frequency problems to the attention of system 
builders and users, so that deliberate design deci- 
sions can be made before the system is implemented. 
An early goal in FoG was to generate text with 
stylistic variation by making use of paraphrase al- 
ternatives. Text generation typically provides an 
opportunity to introduce paraphrase variation, al- 
though the traditional problem has been finding 
ways of choosing from among the possible alterna- 
tives (Iordanskaja et al., 1991). However, many in- 
stances of apparent free variation turned out to have 
a tendency toward contextual determination, and it 
appeared easiest to build these tendencies into strict 
rules. In other cases individual forecasters voiced a 
clearcut preference for one variant form, which was 
subsequently implemented as the unique choice, at 
least for a given weather centre. The final result was 
the elimination of paraphrase from the generator. It
is not clear that this is optimal, but it has simpli- 
fied the design and implementation process during 
a phase when forecasters felt that there were more 
urgent problems. 
One of the surprises in the development of FoG has 
been the constant evolution of language usage initi- 
ated by forecasters. New phenomena are being in- 
troduced (e.g., ultraviolet radiation warnings), other 
phenomena are de-emphasized, and better ways are 
found to say the same thing. The reasons for this 
have been quite varied and often specific to a given 
forecasting office and its client community. The con- 
stant "drift" ofsublanguage usage at individual fore- 
casting sites has led to maintenance of local vari- 
ant systems. The flow of change requests has con- 
firmed the need to keep the components of FoG in 
their most declarative and transparent form for easy 
maintenance. 
Early work showed cases where roughly synony- 
mous words turned out to have somewhat differ- 
ent fuzzy semantics. For example winds can both 
"strengthen" and "increase", but the former term 
tends to be used with high wind speeds. We incor- 
porated a strict separation rule by "legislating" a 
point on the wind speed scale to separate the two 
word definitions. In other cases, apparently random 
variation in usage by forecasters led to an attempt 
to introduce a reasonable set of criteria for choos- 
ing one variant form over another. It appears that 
the very idea of free variation in forecast wording is 
difficult for forecasters to accept, and this natural 
tendency actually makes life easier (but less inter- 
esting) for system designers. 
Future extensions to FoG are planned, including 
new forecast ypes (e.g., technical synopses) and an 
option for synthesized speech output, building on the 
existing linguistic model. We would also like to gen- 
erate forecasts in languages such as Inuktitut, but 
this may require a deeper interlingual representa- 
tion, such as the semantic net already used in other 
applications (Iordanskaja et al., 1991). However, 
languages like Inuktitut also use different conceptu- 
alizations of the weather than English and French, 
which might go beyond the capabilities of the FPA. 
Recent attempts to produce spoken forecasts with 
concatenated speech techniques or commercial text- 
to-speech output devices suffer from a lack of good 
prosody. FoG's Meaning-Text language model pro- 
vides for explicit prosodic structure, percolating 
from the interlingual representation to a new pho- 
netic representation level. Contrastive stress will 
come from text planning, while most other features 
affecting pitch will come from surface syntactic spec- 
ifications.
