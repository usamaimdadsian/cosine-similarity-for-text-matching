Abstract
The prevalence of temporal references
across all types of natural language utter-
ances makes temporal analysis a key is-
sue in Natural Language Processing. This
work adresses three research questions:
1/is temporal expression recognition spe-
cific to a particular domain? 2/if so, can
we characterize domain specificity? and
3/how can subdomain specificity be inte-
grated in a single tool for unified temporal
expression extraction? Herein, we assess
temporal expression recognition from doc-
uments written in French covering three
domains. We present a new corpus of clin-
ical narratives annotated for temporal ex-
pressions, and also use existing corpora in
the newswire and historical domains. We
show that temporal expressions can be ex-
tracted with high performance across do-
mains (best F-measure 0.96 obtained with
a CRF model on clinical narratives). We
argue that domain adaptation for the ex-
traction of temporal expressions can be
done with limited efforts and should cover
pre-processing as well as temporal specific
tasks.
1 Introduction
References to phenomena occurring in the world
and their temporal characterization can be found
in natural language utterances across domains,
genres and languages. Temporal analysis is a
key issue in natural language processing that has
been receiving increasing attention in recent years.
Many efforts in this direction focused on newswire
text in English. The focus on this language and
domain was in part guided by the availability of
the TimeBank corpus (Pustejovsky et al., 2003)
used in evaluation campaigns such as TempE-
val (Verhagen et al., 2007). More recent efforts
have extended the initial work on English and ad-
dressed other languages such as Chinese (Li et al.,
2014), French (Moriceau and Tannier, 2014), Ara-
bic, Italian, Spanish, and Vietnamese (Strötgen et
al., 2014a). A study of three domain corpora in
English in addition to the newswire domain (SMS,
historical narratives and clinical trial abstracts)
yielded interesting insight to extend the normal-
ized representation of temporal expressions (Ströt-
gen and Gertz, 2012). This work was then ap-
plied to cover historical narratives in an additional
seven languages. One key finding was that domain
specificity could differ between languages (Ströt-
gen et al., 2014b). This prompts the need to study
temporal analysis across domains in a variety of
languages in order to adequately characterize each
domain and language pairs.
The clinical domain has been addressed dur-
ing the 2012 i2b2 challenge (Sun et al., 2013b),
with a task on temporal relation extraction from
clinical narratives. This task used a corpus of
clinical notes in English annotated with tempo-
ral information (Sun et al., 2013a) based on ISO-
TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2010). It prompted
further work in this domain in English (Jindal and
Roth, 2013) and Swedish (Velupillai, 2014), in-
cluding the release of detailed guidelines for creat-
ing temporal annotations of clinical text and a dis-
cussion of the clinical domain specificity related
to temporal aspects (Styler IV et al., 2014). Fi-
nally, clinical TempEval 2015 brought the tempo-
ral information extraction tasks of past TempEval
campaigns to the clinical domain (Bethard et al.,
2015).
492
In this paper, we continue to explore temporal
expression identification across domains, with a
focus on French narratives. We introduce a new
corpus of French clinical narratives annotated with
normalized time expressions. We characterize
temporal expression recognition in three domains
and discuss how the development of an automated
temporal expression identification tool may be im-
pacted.
2 Temporal Expression Extraction and
Normalization
Rule-based methods were shown to be very ef-
ficient for the extraction and normalization of
time expressions from news narratives in sev-
eral languages
1
. In the latest SemEval cam-
paign (UzZaman et al., 2013), the rule-based Hei-
delTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2010) out performed
machine-learning and hybrid counterparts by a
large margin. However, statistical systems ob-
tained promising results with respect to temporal
entity extraction.
Based on these results, we chose to use the
state-of-the-art rule-based system HeidelTime as
well as an in-house statistical tool relying on the
Wapiti (Lavergne et al., 2010) implementation of
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et
al., 2001).
Existing HeidelTime settings were used to cus-
tomize it for the analysis of news and historical
narratives in French. In addition, we developed a
set of 14 rules to provide additional customization
for the analysis of clinical narratives in French.
The CRF model was developed using part of the
clinical corpus as a training set, with domain in-
dependant surface and lexical features for the text
tokens:
• The original token from the text (word form);
• Surface features: capitalization of the to-
ken (all in upper/lower case, combination
of both), presence of digit (YES, NO) and
punctuation mark in the token (PUNCT,
NO_PUNCT), temporal type of token ac-
cording to HeidelTime;
• Lexical features: n-grams , number of words,
number of digits, number of consecutive re-
peats. Token frequency was computed based
on the entire training corpus.
1
Normalization is the process of turning any reference to
a date into an absolute, formated date.
For clinical text analysis, we experimented
with standard tokenization (provided by TreeTag-
ger (Schmid, 1994)) and a custom tokenization
where punctuation marks are always considered
as token separators, even in dates such as “10-02-
2010” or “10.04.10”.

3 French Corpora with Temporal
Annotations
For this study, we used two available French cor-
pora with TIMEX3 annotations: the French Time-
Bank corpus (FTB called news in this paper) (Bit-
tar et al., 2011) which covers the news domain and
the AncientTimes corpus (ATC, called historical
in this paper) (Strötgen et al., 2014b) which cov-
ers the historical domain.
To cover a third domain, we developed a corpus
using a set of clinical notes where personal iden-
tifying information (PII) had been marked and re-
placed by surrogates (Grouin and Névéol, 2014).
This included marking some temporal expressions
such as dates, which were replaced by surrogate
dates obtained by substracting a fixed number of
days to the original dates. Manual review ensured
that there were no format or other errors in the re-
introduced surrogate dates. For compatibility with
the sources that were already available, including
our study corpora and HeidelTime, we chose the
TIMEX3 standard for creating temporal annota-
tions.
Three annotators (the authors of this paper) con-
tributed towards the creation of gold-standard an-
notations for time expressions in the corpus. The
annotation of time expressions was carried out in
two phases: first, the time expressions and their
values were annotated, and second the time ex-
pressions were normalized. At the beginning of
the first phase, two initial samples of twenty doc-
uments were selected for all three annotators to
work on. These documents were pre-annotated us-
ing the French version of HeidelTime and dates
marked as PII. The annotators’ task was then to
revise the pre-annotations independently. This
phase of the annotation process contributed to
refining annotation guidelines and creating addi-
tional rules to improve on the pre-annotation. Sub-
sequently, the rest of the corpus was divided be-
tween annotators, so that each document was an-
notated independently by two annotators. Final

gold standard annotations were created by adju-
dicating any disagreements during meetings be-
tween the pair of contributing annotators. Two an-
notators contributed to the second phase of annota-
tions (normalization). A small sample of 20 docu-
ments was annotated independently by the two an-
notators. Inter-annotator agreement was then com-
puted and found to be sufficiently high to allow for
the rest of the corpus to be distributed between an-
notators.
The phasing of annotations allowed having all
corpus documents reviewed several times, so that
time expressions that might have been missed dur-
ing the first phase could be identified and added to
the gold standard in the second phase.
To visualize and create annotations, we used the
BRAT Rapid Annotation Tool (Stenetorp et al.,
2012). Inter-annotator agreement was computed
in terms of F-measure, using the companion brate-
val tool (Verspoor et al., 2013), which we extended
to compute inter-annotator agreement on normal-
ized entities.
Table 1 shows the distribution of time expres-
sions according to types in the three corpora used
in our study. It suggests that domain specificity
is reflected by the types of temporal expressions
found in each of the corpora. While Dates are
prevalent across domains, the news corpus stands
out with a high proportion of Times, the clinical
corpus with a high proportion of Set and the histor-
ical corpus with almost none of either type. Addi-
tional statistics on the clinical corpus are provided
in section 4.

4.2 Extraction of Temporal Expressions
across Domains
Table 3 presents the results of temporal expression
extraction in French narratives across the three
domains in our study. The model configurations
used are either HeidelTime (H) or statistical (S),
adapted to one of the three domains. For Heidel-
Time models, the adaptation consisted in selecting
a domain specific set of rules. We also report re-
sults by Strötgen et al. (2014b) showing the dif-
ference between HeidelTime 1.5 and the improve-
ments obtained by their new rules for historical
French texts. For statistical models, the adaptation
consisted in training the model on a corpus of the
relevant domain. We studied the effect of corpus
size by training a model using a portion of the clin-
ical training data equivalent in size to that of FTB
(marked clin- in Table 3). However, the ATC cor-
pus was too small to train any usable models (re-
sults not shown). Experiments with our adapted,
in-house tokenization tool are marked with a + in
the models.
The results of the evaluation are reported in
terms of precision, recall and F1-measure. We
evaluate the extraction of temporal expressions
associated to the correct TIMEX3 attribute type
(DATE, DURATION, TIME, SET), with the ‘strict’
measure (only exact match is correct) and the ‘re-
laxed’ measures (overlaps are allowed).

5 Discussion
Overall, our results show that while good perfor-
mance can be achieved for the extraction of tem-
poral expression on many specific domains, the
task of automatically extracting temporal expres-
sions is not solved across the board. Methods that
are successfully developed for one specific domain
do not carry very well over to other domains with-
out any adaptation work. In our experiments, rule-
based methods seem to fare somewhat better in
terms of generalizability, but statistical methods
can be better optimized for a particular domain,
given enough training data. Similar insight re-
sulted from a recent study of negation detection
in the clinical domain (Wu et al., 2014). One addi-
tional issue highlighted in the negation study was
that the definition of the entities that could fall un-
der the scope of negation varied from domain to
domain in the available negation corpora. This
pitfall is avoided with the temporal task thanks
to the use of the TimeML standard. The chal-
lenges of extracting temporal expressions across
domains that we identified in this study on French
correlate well with those described by (Strötgen
and Gertz, 2012) on English. The performance of
statistical models trained on in-domain data was
significantly higher compared to out-domain data:
S-news+ yielded the highest performance on the
News corpus (strict F-measure 0.74), and S-clin+
yielded the highest performance on the Clinical
corpus (strict F-measure 0.94).
Adaptation burden. The amount of effort
to adapt to new domains was overall limited for
the rule-based system: only a few rules needed
to be added to the news-oriented HeidelTime (2
for historical, 14 for clinical) to reach compara-
ble performance on other domains. The adapta-
tion effort for the statistical model relies mostly
on the availability of annotated corpora in the
relevant domains. A competitive CRF model
can be trained without using domain specific fea-
tures. However, we find that adaptation effort
can cover pre-processing: for clinical documents,
using domain-specific tokenization yielded im-
proved temporal expression extraction for both
rule-based and statistical systems. This is in line
with previous findings that pre-processing is es-
sential for making experiments reproducible, and
variations in pre-processing methods can result in
significant difference in performance for different
NLP tasks (Fokkens et al., 2013).
Finally, we can note that the difference between
HeidelTime and CRFs is much bigger on the strict
measure than on the relaxed measure, which may
suggest that small variations could be better han-
dled with more covering rules.
Impact of pre-processing, training corpus
type and size. Tokenization had a real impact
on the performance of statistical models. Using a
baseline tokenization method can reduce the per-
formance by several points in F-measure (strict
F-measure of 0.68 for S-news vs. 0.74 for S-
news+ on the News corpus, strict F-measure of
0.88 for S-clin vs. 0.94 for S-clin+ on the Clin-
ical corpus – see Table 3). Corpus size had a
comparably smaller impact. The training dataset
used for S-clin is 10 times larger than that used
for S-clin-, and yet it provides an improvement of
about 4 points in F-measure for in-domain appli-
cation. Conversely, for out-domain application,
using the larger model is detrimental. Using in-
domain training data (or more generally, training

data that is as close as possible to in-domain, such
as News vs. Clinical for Historical) of any rea-
sonable size yields better performance, even if still
under the rule-based approach.
Limitations of this study. Size imbalance in
the corpora used in our study was a limitation; the
clinical corpus is much larger than the other two
and the Historical corpus is really small, which
limits the applicabiblity of statistical methods. In
our work with the clinical corpus, more time was
spent on annotating data and implementing sta-
tistical models vs. developping rules. Arguably,
devoting additional efforts to rule development
might improve the rule-based performance.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
This study contributes to a better understanding of
temporal expression recognition accross domains.
We found that an important part of domain speci-
ficity lies in the distribution of the types of tempo-
ral expressions accross domains. We also noticed
that specific mentions of temporal expressions can
be categorized as different types from one domain
to another (e.g. le soir was generally considered a
set in our clinical corpus – as in every night – and a
time in the news corpus – as in in the evening). The
results of our domain adaptation experiments sug-
gest that the performance of temporal expression
recognition is improved when domain specificity
is taken into account by using in-domain training
data or domain-specific rules.
In terms of adaptation strategy, our experiments
show that the addition of a limited number of rules
to the default (news-oriented) HeidelTime leads
to matching the expected performance of Heidel-
Time on a new domain corpus. Furthermore, we
show that more substantial efforts spent on an-
notating data can result in training data that will
support a statistical model that outperforms simple
rule adaptation. We can hypothesize that devoting
equivalent efforts towards rule development may
also result in increased performance. We believe
that some amount of corpus annotation is neces-
sary to gain adequate corpus knowledge to craft
such rules.
Overall, we show that domain adaptation for
the extraction of temporal expressions can be done
with limited efforts, provided that an adequate cor-
pus is available. We found that the tokenization
method used in pre-processing was instrumen-
tal for improving statistical model performance
across domains.
In future work, we will address the task of tem-
poral expression normalization.
