ABSTRACT 
The work presented here is a preliminary sn~y 
concerning the automatic translation of French 
natural language statements into the RESEDA seman- 
tic metalanguage. The text in natural language is 
first (pre)processed in order to obtain its syntac- 
tic structure. The "semantic parsing" process 
begins with marking the "triggers", defined as 
lexical units which call one or more of the predi- 
cative patterns allowed for in the metalanguage. 
The pat terns  obtained are then merged, and their 
case slots filled with the elements found in the 
surface structure according to the predictions 
associated with the slots. 
I INTRODUCTION 
The work that I i n tend  to  presen~ here is a 
preliminary study concerning the automatic trans- 
lation of French natural language statements into 
the RESEDA semantic language. 
The RESEDA project itself is concerned with 
the creation and practical exploltation of a system 
for managing a biographical database using Arti- 
flcial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The term 
"biographical data" must be understood in its 
widest possible sense : being in fact any event, in 
the public or private Ills, physical or intellectual, 
etc., that it is possible to gather about the 
personages we are interested in. In the present 
state of the system, this information concerns a 
well-defined period in time (approximately between 
1350 and 1450) and a particular subject area 
(French history), but we are now working on the 
adaptation of RESEDA's methodology to the process- 
ing of other biographical data, for example medical 
or legal data. 
RESEDA differs from "classical" factual data- 
base management systems in two ways: 
- The information is recorded in the base using a 
particular Data Definition Language (metalan- 
guage) which uses knowledge representation 
techniques. 
- A user interrogating the base obtains not only 
information which has been directly introduced 
This research is Jointly financsd by the "Agmnce 
de l'Informatique - A.D.I." (CNRS/ADI contract n ° 
507568) and the "Centre National de la Recherche 
Scientifique - C.N.R.S." (ATP n ° 955045). 
into it, but also "hidden" information found using 
inference mechanisms particular to the system : 
in this respect, the most important character- 
Istic of the system lies in the Possibility of  
using inference procedures to question the data- 
base about causal relationships which may exist 
between the different recorded facts, and which 
are not explicitly declared at the time of data 
entry (Zarrl, 1979;1981). For example, the 
system may try to explain by inference top-level 
changes in the State administration in terms of 
changes in Political power. 
II T~E RESEDA METALANGUAGE 
The biographical information which consti- 
tutes the systea's database is organized in the 
form of units called "planes". There are several 
different types of plane, sea Zarri e_~ al..L. (1977); 
the "predicative planes", the most important, cor- 
respond to a "flash" which illustrates a partlcu- 
lam mament in the "Ills story" of one or more per- 
sonagas. A predicative plane is made up of one of 
flve possible "predicates" (BE-AFFECTED-BY, 
BERAVE, BE-PRESENT, MOVE, PRODUCE) ; one or more 
"modulators" may be attached to each predicate. 
The modulator's function is to specify and 
delimit the semantic role of the predicate. Each 
predicate is accompanied by "case slots" which in- 
troduce their own arguments ~ dating and space 
location is also given within a predicative plane, 
as is the bibliographic authority for the state- 
ment. Predicative planes can be linked together 
in a number of ways ; one way is to use expllcit 
links of "coordination", "alternative", "causalic/'5 
"finality", "condition", etc. The data represen- 
tation we have chosen in the RESEDA project is 
basically, therefore, a kind of "case grammar", 
according to the particular meaning attached to 
the term in an AI context (Bruce, \[975~ Charniak, 
1981; etc.). 
For example, the data "Andr~ Marchant was 
named provost of Paris by the King's Council on 
22nd September 1413 ;he lost his post on 23rd 
October 1414, to the benefit of Tanguy du ChAtel, 
who was granted this office", will be represented 
in three planes - that of the nomination of Andr~ 
Merchant, his dismissal and the nomination of 
Tanguy du Oh&tel. 
The coding of information must be made on two 
distinct levels : an "external coding, up until 
143 
now performed manually by the analyst, gives rise to 
a first type of representation, formalized accord- 
ing to the categories of the RESEDA metalanguage ; 
a second automatic stage results in the "internal" 
numeric code. The external "manual" coding of the 
three events just stated is given in figure I. The 
code in capital letters indicates a predicate and

its associated "case slots". Every predicative 
plane is characterized by a pair. of "time refer- 
ences" (datel-date2) which give the dtLration of the 
episode in question. In these three planes, the 
second date slot (date2) is empty because their 
modulators (begin, end) specify a change of state 
associated with a punctual event. "Andr~-Marchant" 
and "Tanguy-du-Ch&tel" are historical personages 
known to the system ; "provost", "king's-council" 
and "letters-of-nomination" are terms of RESEDA's 
lexicon. The classifications associated with the 
terms of the lexicon provide the major part of the 
system's socio-historical knowledge of the period. 
"Paris" is the "location of the object". If the 
historical sources analyzed gave us the exact 
causes of these events, we would introduce into the 
database the corresponding planes and associate 
them with these three planes by an explicit link 
of type "CAUSE". 
This manual procedure for converting informa- 
tion in natural language into one or more planes 
has at least two major disadvantages which the 
proposed study intends to deal with : 
- The manual representation of biographical infor- 
mation in the terms of the metalanguage can only 
be performed by a specialist. This is done, at 
the moment, by the researchers themselves who 
have constructed the prototype system. Such a 
method is obviously out of the question if the 
system is to be used routinely by an uninitiated 
public, especially as RESEDA was conceived as a 
system supplied continuously with biographical 
information extracted from many different sources. 
- In spite of the fact that the syntax of RESEDA's 
metalanguage imposes strict constraints on the 
forming of predicative schemata accepted by the 
system and that these are then thoroughly 
checked, we cannot completely exclude the poss- 
ibillty of two coders translating the same in- 
formation differently. 
III DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD OF AUTOMATIC CODING 
To describe our methodology, I will use the 
example given in the preceeding section. The 
initial text in natural language is first (pre) 
processed to obtain its constituent structure. 
For this purpose, we have used in a first approach 
the French surface grammar implemented in DEREDEC, 
a software package developed at the University of 
Quebec at Montreal by Pierre Plante (1980a;1980b). 
This system, comparable to an ATN parser, permits 
a breakdown of the surfaoe text into its syntactic 
constituents, and establishes, between these con- 
stituents, syntagmatic relationships of the type 
"topic-comment", "determination" and "~oordina~ion". 
This preliminary analysis provides a context for 
subsequent processing, without necessarily removin~ 
all the ambiguities : in the same vein, see Bog~raev 
and Sparck Jones (1982). 
The specific tools that we intend to develop 
for ~his project are of two types : a general 
procedure which can be likened to a sort of sem- 
antic parsing, and a system of heuristic rules. 
A. ~emantic Parsln~ 
The first stage of the general procedure 
consists of marking the "triggers", defined as 
lexical units which call for one or more of the 
predicative patterns allowed for in RESEDA's meta- 
language. Thus we do not take into consideration 
every one of the lexical items met in the surface 
text, retaining only those directly pertaining to 
the "translation" to be done. 
However, we do not limit ourselves to a 
simple keyword approach, since a number of oper- 
ations utilizing data provided by the morpho- 
syntactic analysis executed by DEREDEC are necess- 
ary before the predicative patterns which will be 
actually used afterwards can be selected. 
One of the results of the DEREDEC analysis ~s 
a kind of lemmatization enabling the reduction of 
surface forms in the text to a canonical form ; 
for example, infinitive in the case of verbs. The 
canonical forms found in the text under examination 
are compared with a list of potential triggers 
stored permanently in the system. In the case of 
the sentence we are analyzing we can construct 
from this list the following sub-list : verbal 
forms - "name", "loss", "qrant" ; ter~s pertainang 
directly to the metalanguage or terms which have a 
direct correspondence with elements of the meta- 
language : "office", synonymous with "post" in 
RESEDA ("post" is a "generic" term, a "head" of a 
"sub-tree" in RESEDA's lexicon), and its specifi- 
cation "provost". The results of the pre-analysis 
executed by DEREDEC enable the elimination of 
potential patterns associated with the triggers 
"name" and "grant" which would correspond to sur- 
face constructions of type "active", as in the 
hypothetical example "The Duke of Orl~ans named 
Andr~ Marchant provost of Paris ...". The patterns 
14& 
which will be actually utilized afterwards are 
therefore those shown in figure 2. Note that in 
the case of a trigger "name (active form)" the 
parsonage who figures as surface object would have 
found as the "SUBJECT" of "BE-AFFECTED-BY",whlIst 
the surface subject would have been associated 
with the slot "sOURCE" of "BE-AFFECTED-BY". 
the papal court (social body)". Therefore, for 
example, the pattern in figure 3 is also associ- 
ated with the trigger "name (passive form)" The 
patterns in this second set will be elimina=ed at 
the end of the construction procedure since, as xt 
is not possible to obtain a surface realization of 
the concept "<soclal-body>" in the position

figure 2 
In reality, the predicative structures select- 
ed are not limited to those shown in figure I. 
They are in fact repeated with predicative patterns 
of the type "BE-AFFECTED-BY" which have as "SUBJECT" 
"<social-body>",and as "OBJECT" "<personage>" 
accompanied by the specification ("$PECIF") of a 
"<post>". These constructions each correspond to 
the description : "A personage receives a post in 
a certain organization (the organization in ques- 
tion, SUBJECT, is "augmented", BE-AFFECTED-BY, by 
the personage, OBJECT, in relation, SPECIF, to a 
given post)". A corresponding surface expression 
would be, for example, the following : "Andr~ 
Marchant (personage) is named secretary (post) of 
"SUBJECT", they cannot provide complete predicative 
structures. 
The last stage of the general procedure 
consists of examining the triggers belonging to 
the same morpho-syntactic environments, as defined 
by the results of the DEREDEC analysis. If there 
are several triggers pertaining to the same en- 
vlronment, and if the predicative patterns trigger- 
ed are the same - which means that the predicates 
and case slots must be the same and that the 
modulators, dates and space location information 
must be compatible - then it can be said that the 
triggers refer to the same situation. As a 
name (passive form) ~ begin÷(soc+)BE-AFFECTED-BY SUBJ <social-body>

result, the predicative patterns are merged as to 
obtain the most complete description possible ; 
the predictions about filling the slots linked 
with the cases of the resulting patterns together 
govern to search for fillers in the surface ex- 
pression. 
Thus, the first two triggers in figure 2, 
recognized as relevant to the same environment, 
are combined in the formula in figure 4, which 
gives the general framework of plane i in figure I. 
elements "Andr~ Marchant", "provost", "King's 
Council" and "22nd September 1413" - standardized 
according to RESEDA's conventions, see figure I - 
will take up the slots "SUBJECT", "OBJECT", "SOURCE" 
and "datel" directly. The filling-in operations are 
usually much more complicated, and require the use 
of complex inference rules. I shall say just a 
few words here about the heuristic rules designed 
to solve cases of anaphora (as in our example, 
"he", "this office", "who").

date2 : prohibited 
bibl. : obligatory 
figure 4 
The example we are considering illustrates a 
particularly simple case, in which it is not necess- 
ary to establish links between the planes to be 
created. If we had to process the sentence 
"Philibert de St L~ger is nominated seneschal of 
Lyon on the 30th of July 1412, in lieu of the late 
A. de Viry", three planes should be generated : 
one for the nomination of Philibert de St L~ger, 
one for the death of A. de Viry, and another estab- 
lishing a weak causality llnk ("CONFER", in our 
metalanguage) between the first two planes. 
Surface items such as conjunctions, prepositions 
and sentential adverbs can be used to infer links 
between planes : causality, finality, coordination, 
etc. More precisely, in the last example, "in 
lieu of" is a potential trigger according to the 
following rule : if the main noun group of the 
surface prepositional phrase contains a trigger, 
this phrase constitutes a plane environment and 
"CONFER" introduces the plane created. 
B. Heuristic Rules 
The process I have outlined so far requires a 
corpus of heuristic rules - organized in the form 
of "grammars" associated with the predicative 
patterns of RESEDA's metalanguage - which will 
enable the slots in these patterns to be filled 
using the surface information in accordance with 
the predictions which characterize the slots. In 
the case of the pattern in figure 4, this filling- 
in poses no real problems, since the surface 
146 
In the approach that we propose, marks of 
anaphora are identified during the general analysis 
procedure ; the actual solving brings into play a 
number of criteria from simple pairing off and 
morphological agreement to more subtle criteria, 
like contextual proximity, persistence of theme, 
etc. Thus, morphological agreement and contextual 
proximity are used to replace "who" by "Tanguy du 
ChAtel" in our example ; persistence of the theme 
enables us to fill in the missing date for Tanguy 
du Chatel's posting with the date "23rd October 
1414" appearing in the surface expression. 
We would like to integrate this approach, 
which has been purely empirical up to now, into 
the framework of a more general theory. Two 
directions of enquiry seem particularly interest- 
ing in order to develop our own philosophy of the 
subject. 
The PAL system of Candace Sidner (1979;1981), 
is a top-down anaphora resolution method which 
Makes use of the notion of focus (likened to the 
theme of the discourse). By searching in the 
text for "focuses" which refer to a system of 
representation organized as a series of "frames", 
it is able to solve references. If the reference 
is not found by using the frames themselves, it 
is inferred from other frames contained in the 
database. The interest in this study lies in the 
fact that RESEDA already has, as permanent data, 
a certain amount of general knowledge organized 
in a form very similar to that of frames. Thus, 
in m 7 example, the nomination and dismissal of 
Andr6 Merchant refers ~o the context of the "civil 
war at the beginning of the 15th century" which 
is one of those frames (Zarri et el., 1977). The 
approach used by Klappholz and Lockman (Lockman, 
1978) depends on the hypothesis that there is a 
strong llnk between co-reference and the cohesive 
links of a discourse. These links, when marked 
progressively in the text, become indloes of the 
structure of the discourse, organized as a tree 
structure and created dynamically. These cohesive 
links (effect, cause, syllogism, exemplification, 
etc.) are very similar to the logical connections 
between planes in RESEDA (causality, finality, 
condition, etc.). 
IV CONCLUSION 
The study that I have described here is In- 
tended to automatically achieve a representation 
of fundamental underlying semantic relationships 
corresponding to a French surface expression. I 
have already pointed out the benefits that we 
hope to obtain fram this work as far as RESEDA is 
concerned. I should like ~o add that, on a more 
general level, solving the problem of automati- 
cally recording natural language data would 
obsiously allow us to face, with a certain amount 
of confidence, the analogous problems of natuxal 
language interrogation of RESEDA'S database j the 
advantages of this, f r~  the point of view of 
widespread use of the system, are obvious. But 
the results of this study can, in principle, be 
used not only in the framework of RESEDA, but in a 
number of different applications such as, for 
example, automatic abet.faction, paraphrase, machine 
translation and the direct coding of natural 
language documents in a factual database.
