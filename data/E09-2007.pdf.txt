We compare the phenomena of clausal coor-dinate ellipsis in Estonian, a Finno-Ugric lan-guage, and German, an Indo-European lan-guage. The rules underlying these phenomena appear to be remarkably similar. Thus, the software module ELLEIPO, which was origi-nally developed to generate clausal coordi-nate ellipsis in German and Dutch, works for Estonian as well. In order to extend ELLEIPO’s coverage to Estonian, we only had to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination. We describe the language-independent rules for coordinate el-lipsis that ELLEIPO applies to non-elliptical syntactic structures in both target languages. 1 Introduction In written German newspaper text, clausal coor-dination occurs in about 14% of the sentences, and coordinate ellipsis (e.g. (1)) in about 7% (see a corpus study by Harbusch and Kempen, 2007). Studies of ellipsis in Estonian are hardly avail-able (cf. Erelt, 2003). (1) Monopole    sollen  geknackt werden und         Monopolies should shattered     be     and         Märkte   sollen   getrennt werden         markets should      split       be       'Monopolies should be shattered and markets split’ In order to deal with these relatively frequent phenomena, we develop an Estonian coordinate-ellipsis generator based on ELLEIPO, the software module written in JAVA that generates clausal coordinate ellipsis in German and Dutch (Har-busch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). Given the fact that the two target languages belong to two rather different language families (German is an Indo-European, Estonian a Finno-Ugric language) we expected the two target languages to differ con-siderably with respect to the rules for generating coordinate elisions; however, this expectation 
was falsified. As we will detail below, a pairwise comparison of a heterogeneous set of elliptical constructions in the target languages reveals that the German rules we had implemented in ELLEIPO also generate the Estonian structures. We only needed to adapt the lexicon and some syntax rules unrelated to coordination. The core algorithm worked language-independently for both languages. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we first define the four main groups of clausal coordinate ellipsis phenomena, and show that the elisions in the two target languages obey basi-cally the same rules. This implies that the Esto-nian version of the software system ELLEIPO can use the same core algorithm as the German and Dutch version. In section 3, we discuss other lin-guistic theories for clausal coordinate ellipsis, especially focussing on implementations for gen-eration. In final section 4, we draw some conclu-sions and address options for future work.  2 Clause-level coordinate ellipsis in Es-tonian and German In the literature, one often distinguishes four ma-jor types of clause-level coordinate ellipsis (which can become combined; cf. example (1)).1 • GAPPING, with three special variants called LONG DISTANCE GAPPING (LDG), SUB-GAPPING, and STRIPPING, • FORWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (FCR), • BACKWARD CONJUNCTION REDUCTION (BCR;                                                 1 We will not deal with the elliptical constructions known as VP Ellipsis, VP Anaphora and Pseudogapping because they involve the generation of pro-forms instead of, or in addi-tion to, the ellipsis proper. For example, John laughed, and Mary did, too—a case of VP Ellipsis—includes the pro-form did. Nor do we deal with recasts of clausal coordina-tions as coordinate NPs (e.g., John likes skating and Peter likes skiing becoming John and Peter like skating and ski-ing, respectively). Presumably, such conversions involve a logical rather than syntactic mechanism.

also called Right Node Raising), and • SUBJECT GAP IN CLAUSES WITH FINITE/ FRONTED VERBS (SGF). They are illustrated in the English sentences (2) through (8). The subscripts denote the elliptical mechanism at work: g stands for Gapping, Sub-gapping, and Stripping, respectively; g(g)+is re-cursively added for LDG; f = FCR; s = SGF; b = BCR. (2) GAPPING: Jüri lives in Tallinn and his children liveg in Tartu (3) LDG: My wife wants to buy a car and my son wantsg [to buy]gg a motorcycle (4) SUBGAPPING: The driver was killed and the pas-sengers wereg severely wounded (5) STRIPPING: My sister lives in Narva and my brother [lives in Narva]g too (6) FCR: Pärnu is the city [S where Ainar lives and wheref Peeter works]  (7) BCR: Riina arrived before three [o’clock]b and Terje left after six o’clock (8) SGF: Into the wood went the hunter and [the hunter]s shot a hare In the theoretical framework by Kempen (2009) and its implementation for German and Dutch in ELLEIPO, the elision process is guided by constraints on lemma- and wordform-identity constraints and, to some extent, linear order.2 ELLEIPO’s functioning is based on the as-sumption that coordinate ellipsis does not result from the application of declarative grammar rules for clause formation but from a procedural component that interacts with the sentence gen-erator and may block the overt expression of cer-tain constituents. Thus, the rules apply to assem-bled non-elliptical (unreduced) tree structures in the final stage of generation. Due to this feature, ELLEIPO can be combined, at least in principle, with various lexicalized-grammar formalisms. However, this advantage does not come entirely for free: The module needs a formalism-dependent interface that converts generator out-put to a canonical form consisting of “flat” syn-tactic trees where all major clause constituents                                                 2 Coordinate structures consist of two or more conjuncts connected by a coordinating conjunction (in our exam-ples: and). Rules of coordinate ellipsis license elision of some consituent in one conjunct under “identity” with a constituent in another conjunct. We distinguish between  lemma identity, where only the word-stems of the constitu-ents have to be identical, and wordform identity, which re-quires not only identity of the stems but also of their mor-phological features. Gapping only requires lemma identity (cf. examples (2) and (4)). In FCR, word-form identity is checked, i.e. the identical word string referring to the same referent (cf. *The boy loves dogs and [the boys]f hate cats). 
are represented at the same hierarchical level (see Harbusch and Kempen 2006; 2007). In the following, we introduce ELLEIPO’s eli-sion rules only in an informal manner (for the pseudocode of the algorithm, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2006; 2009). The rules described in the following can be applied in any order to unre-duced syntactic structures in canonical form. In case of a successful rule application, the elidable constituents (and its non-elided counterpart in the other conjunct) is adorned with a subscript indi-cating the ellipsis type (as illustrated in (2) through (8)). ELLEIPO’s final step executes all possible elliptical combinations (e.g., for exam-ple (1), it also realizes a version with Subgapping and LDG, respectively, i.e.: Monopole sollen geknackt werden und Märkte solleng getrennt werdengg). In Gapping (see examples (9) and (10)), lemma-identical verbs can be elided from the second conjunct, if and only if a contrast is ex-pressed, i.e. each remaining constituent in this conjunct has a counterpart with the same gram-matical function in the first conjunct (cf. (11)).3 (9)   Mari loeb artikleid ja tema pojad _g pakse raa-matuid        Mari liest  Artikel und ihre Söhne _g dicke Bücher        Mari reads articles and her sons          thick books (10)  Jüri elab  Tartus    ja    Tallinnas  _g tema pojad          Jüri lebt   in Tartu und  in Tallinn _g seine Söhne         Jüri lives  in Tartu  and  in Tallinn       his   sons  (11)  *Mari ostab  pirne   ja    Jüri _g  turul         *Mari kauft Birnen und Jüri _g  auf dem Markt           Mari buys   pears   and  Jüri      on the market In Long-Distance Gapping (LDG), the rem-nants, i.e. the non-elided constituents in the pos-terior conjunct, include constituents whose ante-rior counterparts belong to different clauses. My wife in (12) (translation of (3)) belongs to the main clause whereas a car is  part  of  the infini-tival complement clause. Notice that LDG does not require adjacency of the elided verbs (cf. the German example in (12)). (12)  Minu naine soovib osta autot ja minu poeg soo-vibg ostagg mootorratast         Meine Frau will ein Auto kaufen und mein Sohn               willg ein Motorrad kaufengg In Subgapping, the posterior conjunct includes a remnant in the form of a non-finite complement                                                  3 For lack of space, here we cannot go into aspects of word-order variation (both Estonian and German are languages with relatively free word order). For the same reason, we only discuss examples with two conjuncts (although, ELLEIPO analyses n-ary coordinations as well), and cannot pay attention to coordinate structures that include negation.

clause (“VP”; severely wounded in (13); transla-tion of (4)).  (13)   Juht sai  surma ja reisijad  _g  tõsiselt vigastada           Der Fahrer  wurde  getötet  und die  Passagiere                  _g ernsthaft verletzt Stripping is Gapping with the posterior con-junct consisting of one constituent only. This remnant is not a verb, and it is often supple-mented by a modifier (such too in (14), the trans-lation of (5)). (14)  Mu õde elab Narvas ja mu vend _g samuti/ka.         Meine Schwester lebt in Narva und mein Bruder          _g ebenso/ auch In Forward-Conjunction Reduction (FCR), a left-peripheral string of major constituents in the right conjunct is elided under wordform-identity with its counterpart in the right conjunct. In FCR example (15), the left-peripheral string compris-ing complementizer, subject and direct object are elided from the right-hand conjunct. If modifiers that are neither lemma- nor wordform-identical, are placed in between subject and object—as in (16)—, then elision of the object is blocked. (Ac-tually, example (16) is not ill-formed but its right-hand conjunct cannot be interpreted as cleaning the bike.) In main-clause variant (17), elision of the direct object is blocked for similar reasons. (15)   ... et  Jan oma jalgratta asjatundlikult parandas      … dass Jan sein Fahrrad fachkundig     reparierte        ... that   Jan his   bike        expertly         repaired        ja    [et     Jan oma jalgratta]f hoolikalt  puhastas        und [dass Jan sein Fahrrad]f eifrig        putzte         and that   Jan  his   bike          diligently cleaned (16) *… et  Jan asjatundlikult oma jalgratta parandas         ... dass Jan fachkundig   sein Fahrrad reparierte       ja   [et     Jan]f hoolikalt [oma jalgratta]f puhastas        und [dass Jan]f eifrig     [sein Fahrrad]f  putzte (17) *      Jan parandas  oma jalgratta asjatundlikult        *      Jan reparierte sein Fahrrad  fachkundig        ja    Janf puhastas  [oma jalgratta]f hoolikalt         und Janf putzte      [sein Fahrrad]f  eifrig Backward-Conjunction Reduction (BCR) li-censes elision of a right-peripheral string in the left-hand conjunct under lemma-identity4 with its counterpart in the right conjunct. However, un-like FCR’s mirror image, BCR may cut into ma-jor constituents of the clause. In BCR example (18), the direct object can be elided in the first conjunct whereas in word-order variant (19), the verb blocks this elision. Example (20) illustrates that BCR, unlike the three other ellipsis types, may cut into major clausal constituents and only                                                 4 ELLEIPO also checks case-identity to rule out ?Hilf _b[DAT] und reanimier [den Mann]ACC ‘Help and reanimate the man’ 
checks lemma-identity. Varying the objects to ‘new bike’/‘old bikes’, and the second subject ‘Peter’ to ‘his brothers’ does not rule out ellipsis as long as peripheral access is guaranteed.  (18)        Jan    parandas   [oma jalgratta]b               Jan    reparierte  [sein Fahrrad]b               Jan     repaired     his     bike         ja   Peeter puhastas   oma jalgratta        und Peter  putzte        sein Fahrrad  and Peter  cleaned      his   bike (19) *...  et      Jan      [oma jalgratta]b parandas        * ... dass  Jan     [sein Fahrrad]b  reparierte          ja et        Peeter oma jalgratta puhastas         und dass Peter  sein Fahrrad putzte (20)           Jan            parandas  oma  uue    jalgrattab                  Jan           reparierte sein  neues Fahrradb         ja tema vennad puhastasid oma vanad jalgrattad        und seine Brüder putzten    ihre  alten  Fahrräder Examples (21)-(23) embody word-order vari-ants within two simple coordinated clauses. The (il)licit elision patterns verify that in BCR the ellipsis should be right-peripheral in the left-hand conjunct, whereas in FCR the ellipsis is located left-peripherally in the right-hand conjunct. (21) Mari loeb _ b  ja   Jüri kirjutab  raamatuid           Mari liest  _ b und Jüri schreibt Bücher         Mari reads      and Jüri  writes    books (22)  * _ b Loeb Mari  ja   raamatuid kirjutab Jüri    * _ b Liest Mari und Bücher     schreibt Jüri            reads Mari and books    writes    Jüri (23)  Raamatuid loeb Mari  ja     _ f  kirjutab Jüri   Bücher      liest  Mari  und _ f   schreibt Jüri   Books       reads Mari and            writes    Jüri SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Fi-nite/Fronted verb) licenses elision of the subject of the right conjunct if in the left conjunct the subject follows the verb; however, the first con-stituent of the unreduced right-hand clausal con-junct must meet certain special requirements. In particular, it should be the subject of this clause (as in (24), translation of  (8)) or a modifier (25), but not an argument other than the subject, e.g. neither complement nor (in)direct object (26). Additionally, if FCR is also possible, it should actually be realized in order to license SGF (for additional discussion of these restrictions, see Harbusch and Kempen, 2009). (24) Metsa           läks  jahimees   ja    _s tappis jänese In den Wald ging der Jäger und _s schoss einen Hasen.  (25) Miks/Eile oled  sa    läinud        ja         Warum      bist   du   gegangen  und         Why          have you  left            and            _f    ei ole _s  midagi                                  öelnud?        _f hast _ s  mich  nicht                              gewarnt?             have not me (Est.)/have me not (Ger.) warned        ‘Why did you leave but didn’t you warn me?’

(26) *Seda      veini   ei  joo ma                  *Diesen Wein  trinke ich nicht      This     wine  drink not I (Est.)/drink I not (Ger.)     enam      ja    [selle    veini]f  kallan mas  ära     mehr      und [diesen Wein]f  gieße  ichs  weg          anymore and   this     wine     throw   I     away    ‘I don’t drink this wine and  throw it away’ Given the similarities between the rules that appear to control clausal coordinate ellipsis in German and Estonian, it is not surprising that  the German/Dutch version of ELLEIPO could be tailored to Estonian easily. ELLEIPO’s language-independent core algorithm generates Estonian ellipsis as well, as shown by the demonstrator. For the sake of completeness, we should add here that we have not been able to find types of clausal coordinate ellipsis in Estonian that go beyond the above four types; hence, as far as we can tell, Estonian does not require additional rules over and above those we needed for Ger-man and Dutch. 3 State of the art in ellipsis generation All major grammar formalisms provide rules for clausal coordinate ellipsis—rules that tend to be intertwined with rules for nonelliptical coordina-tion (e.g. Sarkar and Joshi (1996) for Tree Ad-joining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combi-natory Categorial Grammar; Frank (2002) for Functional Grammar; Crysman (2003) and Bea-vers and Sag (2004) for HPSG; and te Velde (2006) for the Minimalist Program). This also applies to many NLG systems (cf. Reiter and Dale, 2000). Generators that do include an autonomous component for coordinate ellipsis— that is, a component that takes unreduced coordi-nations expressed in the system’s grammar for-malism as input and return elliptical versions as output (Shaw, 1998; Dalianis, 1999; Hielkema, 2005)—use incomplete rule sets, thus risking over- or undergeneration, and incorrect or un-natural output.  4 Conclusion Finally, we do not expect that the four types of clausal coordinate ellipsis presented here are “ ?universal” ? in the sense that all natural languages exhibit all four of them and no language has ad-ditional types (see Harbusch and Kempen 2009 for some discussion based on language-typological work by Haspelmath, 2007). How-ever, the experience described in this paper makes us confident that the ?”modular ?” approach taken in the ELLEIPO project will prove efficient 
when it comes to writing coordinate ellipsis rules for other languages—especially for languages belonging other language families. References  John Beavers and Ivan A. Sag. 2004.
