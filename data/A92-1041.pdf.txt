1 Introduction 
Most advaneed systems for natural lanL~3ge " prgcessing use 
powerfullexicons and mg_rp_ho-lexical proc~ssi~g.~ ehvironments. 
• The s!r4. em descn\])ed b~low enables monolifigual lexicon han- 
dling and incorporat ~ morpho-lexical processes (i.e. word-form

S~c6 in our appr_oach .the morphological processes .obey a 
paradigmatic morphology (Ttt~.- 19~), word-f6rms analysis and 
synthesis take into account, ont~ grammatical endings.(wlj.'ch in- 
dudes both desinences and sutr@s. ) and the lexicons handled by 
MORPHO-2 system are root- or lemma-oriented. By. lexicon we 
don't mean only a collection of roots and associated features. At 
lexicon level we also encounter the control structures needed for 
morphological prow.ssi~, morpho-lexical cquisition menus, 
root modification rules, word-forms synthesis rules, etc. 
The services provided by the system ay be ch¢.~ified accord- 
ing to the follox;vhag,  o,o,~: morphological model .design, lexi.cal 
st6ck building and morpho-lexicfil pro6essing(Dumitrescu, 1991). 
2 Morphological Model Design 
In order to build the mo.rphological model, an inte~ated environ- 
ment which allows edi'-tmg , viewing and comping the mor- 
pholoffical model descrioti6n, isavailable to the 
De-fining the morp.ho\].ogical model takes place m several steps, 
during " .whiCh the lin~afist hfis to specify the following; 
a) the categories, subcategories, features and their 
values, in a hierarchical manner 
b) the paradigmatic descriptions 
c) the default feature specifications associated to each 
paradigmatic description 
d) the lemma - entry correspondence, for each paradig- 
matic description 
e) the inflectional paradigms and root detection rules. 
. The hierarchical de~crip0.'on f features is achieved by cor- 
relating several feature sp&ifications.+A feature spe:#fication is
given re, the fo .rna of a,(fe~ture: v~lu 9 ) pair.. We ~ a paradig- 
matic 9escripdon. a. hierarchical description build of several

O-lOOSE nodes(when only one successor is selected) or V'OREACH 
nodes (_when the individual selection of each successor is re- 
quired). In the figure, a V'OREACH node is outlined by a curve 
drawn over the emerging edges: By t rave~ the tree across the 
longest path_ which starts trom the root node, thru CHOOSE nodes 
only, th6 selector of a paradigmatic description isobtained (e.g. 
CAT = NOUN&SCAT = COMMON&GEN = ~ CAT = VERB). 
The _description attached to a leaf node ts represented by 
means of a morpho-lexical cqui#. "tion scenario. A scenario entry 
(further on referred to as a slot) corresponds to a point of the parad~aatic de4~'ption spa~. 
Selectors of those descriptions allowin K default feature 
specifications are attached with (feature: value )pairs which are 
~uk  inheritances of the corre.sponding slots, fn our example 
me tollowing association isl~asu'ble: (CAT= VB) - > (pER 12 3). 
The area of the m9rphplogi .c.c.c.c # model where the lemma - entry 
(from par adigmati.c - de£~ripdpn ) correspondenees aredescrl\]ged, 
.consi~.- in a specification ot the points from the paradigmatic 
. de~ipdon spa_ces , which characterize the lemma field from the 
lexicon entry. Thks way, the lexical level required by the lexical 
transfer is ensured. 
The .last step in. the morphologi.'cal model description is to 
inform, me s3~stem about how to buTdd inflexional p~adigms - and 
root detection rules. For each paradigma_ ticdesci-iption the lin- 
t~st~ may specify more paradiginatic encfing " families from which 
t e system then builds the inflectional paradigms. For the 
Rom/mian hnguage, there have been identified 136 inflectional 
paradigtns. ). 
Bas~l o(n ~'I~e 1.mf198~onal pgradign~ the system will determine 
the rules for root detection and word-lorm generation. 
Such a rule has the follpwing form: 
< inflexion >: = (< inflectional-paradigm > < slot-number >) 
with the followin~ meani~_.: 
a) if a word ends in < inflexion > then 
247
~dae root is what rernaim from the word after dropping 
the < inflexion > 
~dae root belongs to the < inltectional-Lgaradig m > 
othe contextual-information c rresponding tothe current 
word is ~'en by < slot-number > 
b) g a root belongs to the < inflectional-paradigm > and 
it is used in the context given by < slot -numlSer > then 
othe word is obtained-by concatenating the given root 
with the < inflexion >. 
The lexicographer's interface is stric0y deoendent on the 
Sofpeo-fim~ejCatiomfrom the linguist's interface sifice a'lar~e part of the 
ormer is built automatically from the spedfications o-f tile latter. 
3 Lexical Stock Building 
MORPHO-2 lets the lexi.cog~apher d fine new entries in the lexi- 
con by means of a user-frien ..dly window oriented interface. 
Alexicon entry, has the foll6wing formal structure: 
< entry> ::= (< lemma > 
(< par a .digm,atic-description-selector > 
< inflexional-paradigni > .. 
< root > < morpho\].ogic-description >)  , , , 
(<syntactic-des~ption> < senianfic-description> ) ) ) 
The fields < lemma >, < _p,gradigmafi'c-deslaJption-selector > 
and < inflexional-paradigm > have 0ae obvious meaning. 
The field < root > may contain one or more roots~Inserting 
r .oots in the lexicon takes place in such a way that these should 
inherit the morphologicaI descriptions bel6nging to the slots 
where they occur. 
By < syntactic-description > ~ refer to restrictions on co- 
occurrence with other words .(or phrases). In order to slxcify 
such restrictions for the Roman~ ~ 6  we have perfor/ned 
subeategorization f verbs based on their valency, object 
categories which .they govern(ea,~ a direct object may be an ac- 
cu~.a. -tive noun without pre0osition, a reflexive pronoun or a non- 
finite form of a verb) and semantic features.The latter allow a 
noncontextual subcatego.rizati.on (f r exarn ple of nouns_) and a 
contexual one ~ sel~tional resfrictions (ih the case of ve.rbs). 
Typically, verb~ have a valency between 1 and 3 (th. otigh 
imp&sonaI verbs may have valen .cy 0). The inlransitive verbs.are 
claksified accor .ding to semantic criteria (verbs of motion~ state) or 
by their syntactic usa~ (like predicativi~ auxiliaries, urgpers6nal 
verbs with dative ).W'e should-notice that he same verb maybe 
transitiv 9 or intransitive, accor "ding to its m e.,~fin~; for example a
ajuq. ~ (to get to) with the meaniffg a pt/nde (to catch) is trangitive 
and ~tli th~ mefining aft su~ (tobe enofigh) is h/transitive. 
Trivalent.verbs "m.iSlude v rbs tgking: 
~wo direct., objects which have different meanings and are 
not coordinated (the first one is doubled by an accusative, 
personal pronotai).

For each syntactic .des~i. "ption, the lexicographer ma.y provide 
one or more semantic degcril~ion~ The <semanti6-clesc0" p- 
fion > field contaim the name oT a case-frame structure placed m 
a generic-specific hierarchy. The actual semantic descriI~tious are 
stored in a separate data area, than the rest of the leficon, and 
they are managed independently of MORPHO-2. 
A lexicon e21itor offers the lekicographer commands for delet- 
~g. modifying alexicon entry and ~aen" listing according t 9 dif- 
ferent requests with respect to entry fields (Dtffnilxescu,1991). 
4 Morpho-Lexical Processing 
The target natural l,~mguage processing system is the beneficiary 
of the morpho-lexical processes execut~ byMORPHO-2. _Word- 
forms ~ and synf.hesis are mediated b~ a proce.ss interlace. 
In the case of 1.~c~.. analysis, if the interface is giyen a se- 
quence_of words, it will return a sequence of morpho-lexical 
atoms. "lhe stru~ure ofthese atoms is presented belo~ 
(<root> (<lemma> 
(< para~cMesc0"pfi'on-sclector > 
< fiaorph~logic .-~:xi. "l~tion> . . . .  
(< synt~_~c-t~escriptioh> <semandcMgscfi'ption> ) ) ) ) 
A morphological descriodon contaM~ both contextual and 
context-free inf6i'mafion. The former is oOained from en "ding 
and the latter from the lexicon en_tly corresponding toth~ 
root. The information for the other fields from the atom stru~ure 
is ~ taken from the lexicon entw_ correslx)nding, to the root. 
With respect to the result of morphoqogi _c91 congruence and 
root relxievfl within the lexico~ we may daTsfifv the moroho-lexi- 
cal atoms as unambiguous, am _b~ru_ous ~ind undetermined. 
The unambiguous morlaho-lexical toms assodate the 
analyzed word with a single \[emma. Inthe case of a root which 
.corr~po.nds to one lemma nd ~ more poss~.qgle morpholegi.cal 
descriflions, for the same para.digmatic description selector, the 
system will attempt to compact them. 
The ambiguous morpfio-lexical toms come from words to 
which severaHemmae .may be attached. The association of a root 
with several emmae is possible either due to ambiguity ot 
category (e.g. noun vs. verb) or to apparent homography, 
gene~at&1193/ theabsence of prosodic ma?rkers in the R0hmifi~n 
Kangt~. (m6dele, mod6le, ac61e, ficele, modfil, m6dtfl, etc.). The 
lX~O_~ iriterpretafions are ordered in such way that hose Which 
come from shorter roots (that means longer ending) have prio.rity. 
The undetermined morpho-lexical toms correspond to 
words which have no entry in the lexicon. The atoms generated in 
this situation have the foll6wing structure: 
(UNKNOWN < unknown-word> 
( < ixm~'ble-root > < morphologicMe.scri'pdon >'~*) 
The unknown word is associated with aql legal segmentations 
and for each of them the morphological inf6i'rnation deduced 
from the identified en "dings i  prOcidex\[ 
Lexical synthesis i the reverse of lexical analysk The process 
interface nsures conversion of a morpho-lexical tom sefluence 
into a word _Sg:luence. The morpho-lekical, synthe.sis requi/es the 
descri'ption fniorpho-lexical toms accordifig to the pattern: 
I. < entry-identifier > < morpholoKjc .Mesc~.p0.'on > 
<svntachc-de =riiXion>) 
.whe~ < entry-identifier > maybe alemma, aroot or a semantic 
descri~on. 
We have to point out that previous to morpho-lexical nalysis 
and svnthe.~" tile target p r~r  may co n0g~re the structureot 
morpho-.lexical atoms according to tlie desired application, by 
means ot a communication protocol. 
5 Implementation 
The MORPHO project, started in 1986, has achieved as a first 
result, a prototype version ow available on a PDP-11 compatible 
computer. The second version of the system, the one presented in 
this_~aper, is ing.plemented in C on a IBM-PC. compah'ble. 
The network re~nta f ion  of data and techrfiques used for, 
implementation, lille lexicon in d_e "_rag using prefixekt virtual B . 
trees _(b,xsed on which, for 20000 i~seud'o:random generated 
words, of variable length, retrieval r&l .uires 2 external acxx.sses 
only), have led to an ave.rage r sponse time of lexical processes, 
qutte independent of the leficons ~ (for more.details on perfor-
