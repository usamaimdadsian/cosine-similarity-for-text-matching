Being able to predict he placement of con- 
trastive accent is essential for the assign- 
ment of correct accentuation patterns in 
spoken language generation. I discuss two 
approaches to the generation of contrastive 
accent and propose an alternative method 
that is feasible and computationally at- 
tractive in data-to-speech systems. 
1 Mot ivat ion  
The placement of pitch accent plays an important 
role in the interpretation ofspoken messages. Utter- 
antes having the same surface structure but a differ- 
ent accentuation pattern may express very different 
meanings. A generation system for spoken language 
should therefore be able to produce appropriate ac- 
centuation patterns for its output messages. 
One of the factors determining accentuation is
contrast. Its importance canbe  illustrated with 
all example from GoalGetter, a data-to-speech sys- 
teln which generates spoken soccer eports in Dutch 
(Klabbers et al., 1997). The input of the system is 
a typed data structure containing data on a soccer 
match. So-called syntactic templates (van Deemter 
and Odijk, 1995) are used to express parts of this 
data structure. In GoalGetter, only 'new' inform- 
ation is accented; 'given' ('old') information is not 
(Chafe, 1976), (Brown, 1983), (Hirschberg, 1992). 
However, this strategy does not always lead to a cor- 
rect accentuation pattern if contrastive information 
is not taken into account, as shown in example (1). t 
(1) a Ill the 16th minute, the Ajax player Kluivert 
kicked the ball into the wrong goal. 
b Ten minutes later, Wooter scored for Ajax. 
1 All GoalGetter examples are translated from Dutch. 
Accented words are given in italics; deaccented words 
are underlined. This is only done where relevant. 
The word Ajax in (1)b is not accented by the sys- 
tem, because it is mentioned for the second time and 
therefore regarded as 'given'. However, this lack of 
accent creates the impression that Kluivert scored 
for Ajax too, whereas in fact he scored for the op- 
posing team through an own goal. This undesirable 
effect could be avoided by accenting the second oc- 
currence of Ajax in spite of its givenness, to indicate 
that it constitutes contrastive information. 
2 P red ic t ing  cont ras t ive  accent  
In this section I discuss two approaches to predicting 
contrastive accent, which were put forward by Scott 
Prevost (1995) and Stephen Pulinan (1997). 
In the theory of contrast proposed in (Prevost, 
1995), an item receives contrastive accent if it co- 
occurs with another item that belongs to its 'set of 
alternatives', i.e. a set of different items of the same 
type. There are two main problems with this ap- 
proach. First, as Prevost himself notes, it is very 
difficult to define exactly which items count as be- 
ing of 'the same type'. If the definition is too strict, 
not all cases of contrast will be accounted for. On 
the other hand, if it is too broad, then anything will 
be predicted to contrast with anything. A second 
problem is that there are cases where co-occurrence 
of two items of the same type does not trigger con- 
trast, as in the following soccer example: 
(2) a 
b 
c 
After six minutes Nilis scored a goal for PSV. 
This caused Ajax to fall behind. 
Twenty minutes later Cocu scored for PSV. 
According to Prevost's theory, PSVin (2)c should 
have a contrastive accent, because the two teams 
Ajax and PSV are obviously in each other's altern- 
ative set. In fact, though, there is no contrast and 
PSV should be normally deaccented ue to given- 
ness. This shows that the presence of an alternative 
item is not sufficient o trigger contrast accent. 
519 
Another approach to contrastive accent is advoc- 
ated by Pulman (1997), who proposes to use higher 
order unification (HOU) for both interpretation and 
prediction of focus. Described informally, Pulman's 
focus assignment algorithm takes the semantic rep- 
resentation of a sentence which has just been gener- 
ated, looks in the context for another sentence rep- 
resentation containing parallel items, and abstracts 
over these items in both representations. If the 
resulting representations are unifiable, the two sen- 
tences stand in a contrast relation and the parallel 
elements from the most recent one receive a pitch 
accent (or another focus marker). 
Pulman does not give a full definition of parallel- 
ism, but states that "to be parallel, two items need 
to be at least of the same type and have the same 
sortal properties" ((Pulman, 1997), p. 90). This is 
rather similar to Prevost's conditions on alternative 
sets. Consequently, Pulman's theory also faces the 
problem of determining when two items are of the 
same type. Still, contrary to Prevost, Pulman can 
explain the lack of contrast accent in (2)c, because 
obviously the representations of sentences (2)b and 
(2)c will not unify. 
Another advantage, pointed out in (Gardent et al., 
1996), is that a HOU algorithm can take world know- 
ledge into account, which is sometimes necessary for 
determining contrast. For instance, the contrast in 
(1) is based on the knowledge that kicking the ball 
into the wrong goal implies scoring a goal for the 
opposing team. In a HOU approach, the contrast 
in this example might be predicted by unifying the 
representation f the second sentence with the entail- 
ment of the first. However, such a strategy would 
require the explicit enumeration of all possible se- 
mantic equivalences and entalhnents in the relevant 
domain, which seems hardly feasible. Also, imple- 
mentation of higher order unification can be quite 
inefficient. This means that although theoretically 
appealing, the HOU approach to contrastive accent 
is less attractive from a computational viewpoint. 
3 An  a l te rnat ive  so lu t ion  
Fortunately, in data-to-speech systems like GoalGet- 
ter, the input of which is formed by typed and struc- 
tured data, a simple principle can be used for de- 
termining contrast. If two subsequent sentences are 
generated from the same type of data structure they 
express imilar information and should therefore be 
regarded as potentially contrastive, ven if their sur- 
face forms are different. Pitch accent should be as- 
signed to those parts of the second sentence that ex- 
press data which differ from those in the data struc- 
ture expressed by the first sentence. 
Example (1) can be used as illustration. The the- 
ory of Prevost will not predict contrastive accent on 
Ajax in (1)b, because (1)a does not contain a mem- 
ber of its alternative set. In Pulman's approach, the 
contrast can only be predicted if the system uses 
the world knowledge that scoring an own goal means 
scoring for the opposing team. In the approach that 
I propose, the contrast between (1)a and b can be de- 
rived directly from the data structures they express. 
Figure 1 shows these structures, A and B, which are 
both of the type goaLevent: a record with fields spe- 
cifying the team for which a goal was scored, the 
player who scored, the time and the kind of goal: 
normal, own goal or penalty. 
A: goaLevent 
team: PSV 
player: Kluivert 
minute: 16 
goaltype: own 
B: goaLevent 
team: Ajax 
player: Wooter 
minute: 26 
goaltype: normal 
Figure 1: Data structures expressed by (1)a and b. 
Since A and B are of the same type, the values of 
their fields can be compared, showing which pieces 
of information are contrastive. Figure 1 shows that 
all the fields of B have different values from those of 
A. This means that each phrase in (1)b which ex- 
presses the value of one of those fields should receive 
contrastive accent, 2 even if the corresponding field 
value of A was not mentioned in (1)a. This guar- 
antees that in (1)b the proper name Ajax, which 
expresses the value of the team field of B, is accen- 
ted despite the fact that the contrasting team was 
not explicitly mentioned in (1)a. 
The discussion of example (1) shows that in 
the approach proposed here no world knowledge is 
needed to determine contrast; it is only necessary 
to compare the data structures that are expressed 
by the generated sentences. The fact that the input 
data structures of the system are organized in such 
a way that identical data types express emantically 
parallel information allows us to make use of the 
world (or domain) knowledge incorporated in the 
design of these data structures, without having to 
separately encode this knowledge. This also means 
2Sentence (1)b happens not to express the goaltype 
value of B, but if it did, this phrase should also receive 
contrastive accent (e.g., 'Twenty minutes later, Over- 
mars scored a normal goal'). 
520 
that the prediction of contrast does not depend on 
the linguistic expressions which are chosen to ex- 
press the input data; the data can be expressed in 
an indirect way, as in (1)a, without influencing the 
prediction of contrast. 
The approach sketched above will also give the de- 
sired result for example (2): sentence (2)c will not 
be regarded as contrastive with (2)b, since (2)c ex- 
presses a goal event but (2)b does not. 
4 Future  d i rec t ions  
An open question which still remains, is at which 
level data structures hould be compared. In other 
words, how do we deal with sub- and supertypes? 
For example, apart from the goal_event data type 
the GoalGetter system also has a card_event type, 
which specifies at what time which player received a
card of which color. Since goal_event and card_event 
are different ypes, they are not expected to be con- 
trastible. However, both are subtypes of a more gen- 
eral event type, and if regarded at this higher event 
level, the structures might be considered as contrast- 
ible after all. Examples like (3) seem to suggest that 
this is possible. 
(3) a In the 11th minute, Ajax took the lead 
through a goal by Kluivert. 
b Shortly after the break, the referee handed 
Nilis a yellow card. 
c Ten minutes later, Kluivert scored for the 
second time. 
The fact that it is not inappropriate oaccent Klu- 
ivert in (3)c, shows that (3)c may be regarded as 
contrastive to (3)b; otherwise, it would be obligat- 
ory to deaccent the second mention of Kluivert due 
to givenness, like PSV in (2)c. Cases like this might 
be accounted for by assuming that there can be con- 
trast between fields that are shared by data types 
having the same supertype. In (3), these would be 
the player and the minute fields of structures C 
and D, shown in Figure 2. This is a tentative solu- 
tion which requires further research.

5 Conc lus ion  
I have sketched a practical approach to the assign- 
ment of contrastive accent in data-to-speech sys- 
tems, which does not need a universal definition of 
alternative or parallel items. Because the determin- 
ation of contrast is based on the data expressed by 
generated sentences, instead of their syntactic struc- 
tures or semantic reprentations, there is no need for 
separately encoding world knowledge. The proposed 
approach is domain-specific in that it relies heavily 
on the data structures that form the input from gen- 
eration. On the other hand it is based on a general 
principle, which should be applicable in any system 
where typed data structures form the input for lin- 
guistic generation. In the near future, the proposed 
approach will be implemented in GoalGetter.
