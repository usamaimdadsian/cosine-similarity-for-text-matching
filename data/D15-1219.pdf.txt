Abstract 
This paper proposes a novel approach to 
generate abstractive summary for multi-
ple documents by extracting semantic in-
formation from texts. The concept of 
Basic Semantic Unit (BSU) is defined to 
describe the semantics of an event or ac-
tion. A semantic link network on BSUs is 
constructed to capture the semantic in-
formation of texts. Summary structure is 
planned with sentences generated based 
on the semantic link network. Experi-
ments demonstrate that the approach is 
effective in generating informative, co-
herent and compact summary. 
1 Introduction 
Most automatic summarization approaches are 
extractive which leverage only literal or syntactic 
information in documents. Sentences are extract-
ed from the original documents directly by rank-
ing or scoring and only little post-editing is made 
(Yih et al., 2007; Wan et al., 2007; Wang et al., 
2008; Wan and Xiao, 2009). Pure extraction has 
intrinsic limits compared to abstraction (Carenini 
and Cheung, 2008).  
Abstractive summarization requires semantic 
analysis and abstract representation of texts, 
which need knowledge on and beyond the texts 
(Zhuge, 2015a). There are some abstractive ap-
proaches in recent years: sentence compression 
(Knight and Marcu, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 
2002; Cohn and Lapata, 2009), sentence fusion 
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Filippova and 
Strube, 2008), and sentence revision (Tanaka et 
al., 2009). However, these approaches are sen-
tence rewriting techniques based on syntactical 
analysis without semantic analysis and abstract 
representation. 
Fully abstractive summarization approach re-
quires a separate process for the analysis of texts 
that serves as an intermediate step before the 
generation of sentences (Genest and Lapalme, 
2011). Statistics of words or phrases and syntac-
tical analysis that have been widely used in exist-
ing summarization approaches are all shallow 
processing of text. It is necessary to explore 
summarization methods based on deeper seman-
tic analysis.  
We define the concept of Basic Semantic Unit 
(BSU) to express the semantics of texts. A BSU 
is an action indicator with its obligatory argu-
ments which contain actor and receiver of the 
action. BSU is the most basic element of coher-
ent information in texts, which can describe the 
semantics of an event or action. The semantic 
information of texts is represented by extracting 
BSUs and constructing BSU semantic link net-
work (Zhuge, 2009). Semantic Link Network 
consists of semantic nodes, semantic links and 
reasoning rules (Zhuge, 2010; 2011; 2012; 
2015b). The semantic nodes can be any resources. 
In this work, the semantic nodes are BSUs ex-
tracted from texts. We use semantic relatedness 
between BSUs as semantic links. Then summary 
can be generated based on the semantic link net-
work through summary structure planning.  
The characteristics of our approaches are as 
follows: 
? Each BSU describes the semantics of an 
event or action. The semantic relatedness be-
tween BSUs can capture the context seman-
tic relations of texts.  
? The BSU semantic link network is an ab-
stract representation of texts. Reduction on 
the network can obtain important infor-
mation of texts with no redundancy. 
1908
 ? Summary is built from sentence to sentence 
to a coherent body of information based on 
the BSU semantic link network by summary 
structure planning. 
2 Related Work 
There are some abstractive summarization ap-
proaches in recent years. An approach TTG at-
tempts to generate abstractive summary by using 
text-to-text generation to generate sentence for 
each subject-verb-object triple (Genest and 
Lapalme, 2011). A system that attempts to gen-
erate abstractive summaries for spoken meetings 
was proposed (Wang and Cardie, 2013). It iden-
tifies relation instances that are represented by a 
lexical indicator with an argument constituent 
from texts. Then the relation instances are filled 
into templates which are extracted by applying 
multiple sequence alignment. Both of these sys-
tems need to select a subset of the large volumes 
of generated sentences. However, our system 
generates summary directly by summary struc-
ture planning. It can generate well-organized and 
coherent summary more effectively.  
A recent work aims to generate abstractive 
summary based on Abstract Meaning Represen-
tation (AMR) (Liu et al., 2015). It first parses the 
source text into AMR graphs, and then trans-
forms them into a summary graph and plans to 
generate text from it. This work only focuses on 
the graph-to-graph transformation. The module 
of text generation from AMR has not been de-
veloped. The nodes and edges of AMR graph are 
entities and relations between entities respective-
ly, which are sufficiently different from the BSUs 
semantic link network. Moreover, texts can be 
generated efficiently from the BSUs network. 
Another recent abstractive summarization meth-
od generates new sentences by selecting and 
merging phrases from the input documents (Bing 
et al., 2015). It first extracts noun phrases and 
verb-object phrases from the input documents, 
and then calculates saliency scores for them. An 
ILP optimization framework is used to simulta-
neously select and merge informative phrases to 
maximize the salience of phrases and meanwhile 
satisfy the sentence construction constraints. As 
the results show that the method is difficult to 
generate new informative sentences really differ-
ent from the original sentences and may generate 
some none factual sentences since phrases from 
different sentences are merged. 
Open information extraction has been pro-
posed by (Banko et al., 2007; Etzioni et al., 
2011). They extract binary relations from the 
web, which is different from our approach that 
extracts events or actions expressed in texts. 
3 The Summarization Framework 
Our system produces an abstractive summary for 
a set of topic related documents. It consists of 
two major components: Information extraction 
and summary generation. 
3.1 Information Extraction 
The semantic information of texts is obtained by 
extracting BSUs and constructing BSU semantic 
link network. A BSU is represented as an actor-
action-receiver triple, which can both detects 
the crucial content and incorporates enough syn-
tactic information to facilitate the downstream 
sentence generation. Some actions may not have 
the receiver argument. For example, “Flight 
MH370 – disappear” and “Flight MH370 - leave 
- Kuala Lumpur” are two BSUs.  
BSU Extraction. BSUs are extracted from the 
sentences of the documents. The texts are pre-
processed by name entity recognition (Finkel et 
al., 2005) and co-reference resolution (Lee et al., 
2011). Constituent and dependency parses are 
obtained by Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 
2003). The eligible action indicator is restricted 
to be a predicate verb; the eligible actor and re-
ceiver arguments are noun phrase. Both the actor 
and receiver arguments take the form of constit-
uents in the parse tree. A valid BSU should have 
one action indicator and at least one actor argu-
ment, and satisfy the following constraints: 
? The actor argument is the nominal subject or 
external subject or the complement of a pas-
sive verb which is introduced by the preposi-
tion “by” and does the action. 
? The receiver argument is the direct object or 
the passive nominal subject or the object of 
a preposition following the action verb. 
We create some manual rules and syntactic 
constraints to identify all BSUs based on the syn-
tactic structure of sentences in the input texts.  
Constructing BSU Semantic Link Network. 
The semantic relatedness between BSUs contains 
three parts: Arguments Semantic Relatedness 
(ASR), Action-Verbs Semantic Relatedness 
(VSR) and Co-occurrence in the Same Sentence 
(CSS). Arguments of BSUs include actors and 
receivers, which both are noun phrases and indi-
cate concepts or entities in the text. When com-
puting ASR, the semantic relatedness between 
concepts must be measured. We use the explicit 
1909
 semantic analysis based on Wikipedia to com-
pute semantic relatedness between concepts (Ga-
brilovich and Markovitch, 2007). When compu-
ting VSR, WordNet-based measure is used to 
calculate the semantic relatedness between action 
verbs (Mihalcea et al., 2006). CSS is measured 
whether two different BSUs co-occur in the same 
sentence. Semantic relations between BSUs are 
computed by linearly combining these three parts. 
Then BSUs that are extracted from the texts form 
a semantic link network. 
Semantic Link Network Reduction. A dis-
criminative ranker based on Support Vector Re-
gression (SVR) (Smola and Scholkopf, 2004) is 
utilized to assign each BSU a summary-worthy 
score. Training data was constructed from the 
DUC 2005 datasets which contain both the 
source documents and human generated refer-
ence summaries. BSUs are extracted from these 
datasets. For each BSU in the source documents, 
if it has occurred in the corresponding human 
generated summaries or the semantic relatedness 
between the BSU and one BSU in the corre-
sponding human generated summaries is above a 
threshold ? , then it is considered to be a positive 
sample and be assigned 1 to its summary-worthy 
score. Otherwise, the BSU is considered to be a 
negative sample and be assigned 0 to its sum-
mary-worthy score. Table 1 displays the features 
of BSU used in the SVR model.  Then the salien-
cy score of each BSU in the semantic link net-
work is calculated by the following equation: 
( ) *i i ijjSal BSU SW R= ?                    (1) 
Where iSW  is the summary-worthy score of 
iBSU ; ijR is the semantic relatedness between 
iBSU and jBSU .  
BSUs in the semantic link network are clus-
tered by hierarchical complete-link clustering 
methods. BSUs in each cluster are semantically 
similar. For example, Malaysia Airlines plane - 
vanish and Flight MH370 – disappear. Only the 
most important one with the largest saliency 
score is reserved in the network. These less im-
portant BSUs are eliminated. The remaining BSU 
semantic link network represents the important 
information of the texts with no redundancy. 
3.2 Summary Generation 
The summary for the documents is generated 
directly based on the BSU semantic link network. 
The summary should be well-structured and 
well-organized. It should not just be a heap of 
related information, but should build from sen-
tence to sentence to a coherent body of infor-
mation about a topic.  
The summary structure is planned based on 
the BSU semantic link network. An optimal path 
which covers all the nodes in the network is 
found. The following two factors are considered 
when finding the optimal path: (1) Context Se-
mantic Coherent. To make the summary seman-
tic coherent, all adjacent sentences should be se-
mantically related. We need to find an optimal 
path, in which every two adjacent nodes are 
strong semantically related. The optimal path is 
denoted as 
1 2
[ , ,..., ]
nr r r
P p p p = and maximize
1
1
1
1
i i
n
r ri
n R
+
?
=? . (2) Clear-cut Theme. To make 
the theme of generated summary clear-cut, the 
important content should be put in prior position. 
The order of the ith node in the path is denoted 
as iu and its weight is denoted as
( )1/i iw Sal BSU=  and maximize 1
n
i ii
u w
=? . 
To combine the above two factors, we need to 
find an optimal path which covers each node on-
ly once and has the longest distance. The biased-
sum weight of all nodes in the path should be 
maximized. The problem can be proved to be 
NP-hard by reduction to TSP problem. It can be 
formalized as an integer linear programming 
(ILP) as follow. ijx  is defined  to indicate wheth-
er the optimal path goes from node i to node j. 
1
0ij
if the path goes from node i to node j
x
otherwise
            ?
= ?   ?
  (2) 
Since each node can be traversed only once, 
the following constraints must be satisfied. 
1,
1,
1 1,...
1 1,...
n
iji j i

?
?
              (3) 
The nodes in the path are sequentially ordered. 
If the edge between two nodes is in the path, then 
Basic Features 
Number of words in actor/receiver 
Number of nouns in actor/receiver

1910
 the order of the two nodes is sequentially close to 
each other, which can be formulated as follow: 
 
1
1,...
1,...
i j ij
i
i
u u nx n i j n

?                          =  ?
             (4) 
At last, we can formulate the objective func-
tion as follow: 
1 1, 1
max 1
n n n
ij ij i ii j j i i
n R x w u?
= = ? =
  +? ? ?        (5) 
where parameter ?  tunes the effect of the two 
parts and n is the quantity of BSUs in the final 
BSU semantic link network (after reduction). 
Sentence Generation. After the summary 
structure has been planned, sentences are gener-
ated for each node in the BSU semantic link net-
work. As the BSU contains enough semantic and 
syntactic information, sentence can be generated 
efficiently according to the following rules: 
? Generate a Noun Phrase (NP) based on the 
actor argument to represent the subject, a NP 
based on the receiver argument to represent 
the object if present. 
? Generate a Verb Phrase (VP) based on the 
action verb to link the components above. 
The tense of the verb is set to the same as in 
the original sentence, and most modifiers like 
auxiliaries and negation are conserved. 
? Generate complements for the VP when the 
BSU has no receiver. The verb modifiers fol-
lowing the action verb such as prepositional 
phrases and infinitive phrases can be used as 
the complement, in case that the verb would 
have no interesting meaning without a com-
plement. 
The process of sentence generation for each 
node is based on the syntactic structure of the 
source sentence where the BSU is extracted from. 
The time and location preposition phrases which 
are important information of new events are kept. 
The generated sentences are organized according 
to the summary structure. If some adjacent sen-
tences in the summary have the same subject, the 
subject of the latter can be substituted by a pro-
noun (such as it or they) to avoid repetition of 
noun phrases. One sample summary generated 
by our system for “Malaysia MH370 Disappear” 
news is shown in Figure 1. 
4 Evaluation Results 
4.1 Dataset and Experimental Settings 
In order to evaluate the performance of our sys-
tem, we use two datasets that have been used in 
recent multi-document summarization shared 
tasks: DUC2005 and DUC2007. Each task has a 
gold standard dataset consisting of document 
clusters and reference summaries. In our experi-
ments, DUC2005 was used for training and pa-
rameter tuning, and DUC2007 was used for test-
ing. Based on the tuning set, the parameter ?  is 
set as 10 and ?  is set as 0.7 after tuning. 
Our system is compared with one state-of-the-
art graph-based extractive approach MultiMR 
(Wan and Xiao, 2009) and one abstractive ap-
proach TTG (Genest and Lapalme, 2011). In ad-
dition, we have implemented another baseline 
RankBSU which uses the graph-based ranking 
methods on the BSUs network to rank BSUs and 
select the top ranked BSUs to generate sentences.  
4.2 Results 
ROUGE-1.5.5 toolkit was used to evaluate the 
quality of summary on DUC 2007 dataset (Lin 
and Hovy, 2003). The ROUGE scores of the 
NIST Baseline system (i.e. NIST Baseline) and 
average ROUGE scores of all the participating 
systems (i.e. AveDUC) for DUC 2007 main task 
were also listed. According to the results in Ta-
ble 2, our system much outperforms the NIST 
Baseline and AveDUC, and achieves higher 
ROUGE scores than the abstractive approach 
TTG. So the abstract representation of texts and 
the information extraction process in our system 
are effective for multi-document summarization. 
Our system also achieves better performance 
than the baseline RankBSU, which demonstrates 
that the network reduction method is more effi-
cient than the popular graph-based ranking 
methods. As compared with the state-of-art 
graph-based extractive method MultiMR, our 
system also achieves better performance. Fur-
thermore, our system is abstractive with abstract 
representation and sentence generation. Incorrect

 parser and co-reference resolution will lead to 
wrong extraction of BSU. If with more accurate 
parser and co-reference resolution, our system 
will be expected to achieve better performance.  
Since ROUGE metric evaluates summaries 
only from word overlapping perspective, we also 
use the pyramid evaluation metric (Nenkova and 
Passonneau, 2004) which can measure the sum-
mary quality beyond simply string matching. The 
pyramid evaluation metric involves semantic 
matching of summary content units (SCUs) so as 
to recognize alternate realizations of the same 
meaning, which is a better metric for the abstrac-
tive summary evaluation. Since the manual pyr-
amid evaluation is time-consuming and the eval-
uation results can’t be reproducible with different 
groups of assessors, we use the automated ver-
sion of pyramid proposed in (Passonneau et al., 
2013) and adopt the same setting as in (Bing et 
al., 2015). Table 3 shows the evaluation results 
of our system and the three baseline systems on 
DUC 2007. The results show that the perfor-
mance of our system is significantly better than 
the three baseline systems, which demonstrates 
that the summaries of our system contain more 
SCUs than summaries of other systems. So our 
system can generate more informative summary. 
In addition, large volumes of news texts for 
popular news events are crawled from the news 
websites. Figure 1 and 2 show the summaries for 
the “Malaysia MH370 Disappear” news event 
generated by our system and MultiMR respec-
tively. The summary by MultiMR contains some 
repetition of facts obviously. And it is just a heap 
of information about MH370. The summary by 
our system doesn’t contain much repetition of 
facts, so it can contain more useful information. 
And it is built from sentence to sentence to a co-
herent body. Obviously, the summary by our sys-
tem is more coherent and compact. 
5 Conclusions and Future Works 
The proposed summarization approach is effec-
tive in information extraction and achieves good 
performance on DUC datasets. Through the 
sample summary, we can find that the approach 
is very effective for summarizing texts that main-
ly describe facts and actions of news event. 
Summaries generated by our system are informa-
tive, coherent and compact. 
But for texts expressing opinions, the ap-
proach can’t settle it appropriately. For example, 
when the verbs of BSUs are not meaningful ac-
tions, like “be”, the semantic relations between 
them can’t be appropriately computed by the 
methods described in the paper. More efficient 
methods to computer semantic relations between 
BSUs should be developed in the following work.  
The sentence generation process described in 
the paper is just a preliminary scheme. It should 
be developed to generate sentence relying less on 
the original sentence structure and aggregating 
information from several different BSUs.

Figure 2. The summary of “Malaysia MH370 Dis-

Malaysia Airlines said in a statement that flight MH370 had disappeared at 
02:40 local time on Saturday after leaving Kuala Lumpur. Southeast Asian states 
have joined forces to search waters between Malaysia and Vietnam after a 
Malaysia Airlines plane vanished on a flight to Beijing, with 239 people on 
board. Flight MH370 had been expected to land in Beijing at 06:30. If Malaysia 
Airlines flight MH370 had impacted the ocean hard, resulting underwater sounds 
could have been detected by hydrophones, given favorable circumstances. 
Scientists from the CTBTO analyzed their recordings soon after flight MH370 
disappeared, finding nothing of interest. The CMST researchers believe that the 
most likely explanation of the hydroacoustic data is that they come from the 
same event, but unrelated to Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The lead research-
er of the CMST team, Dr.Alec Duncan, believes there's a slim chance that the 
acoustic event is related to Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Several IMOS 
recorders deployed in the Indian Ocean off northwestern Australia by CMST 
may have recorded data related to Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Malaysia 
Airlines released the names and nationalities of the 227 passengers and 12 crew 
members, based on the flight manifest, later modified to include two Iranian 
passengers travelling on stolen passports. If the data relates to the same event, 
related to flight MH370, but the arc derived from analysis of the aircraft's satel-
lite transmission is incorrect, then the most likely place to look for the aircraft 
would be along a line from HA01. 
Flight MH370 disappeared after leaving Kuala Lumpur. It had been expected to 
land in Beijing at 06:30. It took off at 00:41 MYT from runway 32R. It ended in 
the southern Indian Ocean. The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER made a sharp turn 
westwards. It passed into Vietnamese airspace. The captain of another aircraft 
attempted to reach the crew of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Malaysia 
Airlines flight 386 was requested to attempt to contact Malaysia Airlines flight 
MH370 on the Lumpur Radar frequency. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, 
another Boeing 777-200ER, was surpassed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. 
Malaysia Airlines assumes beyond reasonable doubt there are no survivors. 
They reported the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 missing. They releases 
passenger manifest of flight MH370. They will give US$ 5000 to the relatives 
of each passenger. Malaysia released preliminary report. It set up a Joint Inves-
tigation Team. Southeast Asian states have joined forces to search waters 
between Malaysia and Vietnam. Chinese government criticizes Malaysia for 
inadequate answers regarding Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Malaysia will 
be deploying more ships and equipment to assist in the search. It ends hunt in 
South China Sea. Continued refinement of analysis of flight MH370's satellite 
communications identified a wide area search. Australia and Malaysia are 
working on a Memorandum of Understanding to cover financial and co-
operation arrangements for search and recovery activities.
