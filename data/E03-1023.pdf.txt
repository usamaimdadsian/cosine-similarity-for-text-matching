Abstract
Within the framework of translation
knowledge acquisition from WWW
news sites, this paper studies issues on
the effect of cross-language retrieval of
relevant texts in bilingual lexicon ac-
quisition from comparable corpora. We
experimentally show that it is quite ef-
fective to reduce the candidate bilingual
term pairs against which bilingual term
correspondences are estimated, in terms
of both computational complexity and
the performance of precise estimation of
bilingual term correspondences.
1 Introduction
Translation knowledge acquisition from paral-
lel/comparative corpora is one of the most impor-
tant research topics of corpus-based MT. This is
because it is necessary for an MT system to (semi-
)automatically increase its translation knowledge
in order for it to be used in the real world situ-
ation. One limitation of the corpus-based trans-
lation knowledge acquisition approach is that the
techniques of translation knowledge acquisition
heavily rely on availability of parallel/comparative
corpora. However, the sizes as well as the domain
of existing parallel/comparative corpora are lim-
ited, while it is very expensive to manually col-
lect parallel/comparative corpora. Therefore, it is
quite important to overcome this resource scarcity
bottleneck in corpus-based translation knowledge
acquisition research.
In order to solve this problem, this paper fo-
cuses on bilingual news articles on WWW news
sites as a source for translation knowledge acqui-
sition. In the case of WWW news sites in Japan,
Figure 1: Translation Knowledge Acquisition
from WWW News Sites: Overview
Japanese as well as English news articles are up-
dated everyday. Although most of those bilingual
news articles are not parallel even if they are from
the same site, certain portion of those bilingual
news articles share their contents or at least re-
port quite relevant topics. Based on this obser-
vation, we take an approach of acquiring transla-
tion knowledge of domain specific named entities,
event expressions, and collocational expressions
from the collection of bilingual news articles on
WWW news sites (Utsuro and others, 2002).
Figure 1 illustrates the overview of our frame-
work of translation knowledge acquisition from
WWW news sites. First, pairs of Japanese and En-
glish news articles which report identical contents
or at least closely related contents are retrieved.
(Hereafter, we call pairs of bilingual news arti-
cles which report identical contents as "identical"
pair, and those which report closely related con-
tents (e.g., a pair of a crime report and the arrest
355
of its suspect) as "relevant" pair.) Then, by ap-
plying previously studied techniques of translation
knowledge acquisition from parallel/comparative
corpora, various kinds of translation knowledge
are acquired.
Within this framework of translation knowledge
acquisition from WWW news sites, this paper
studies issues on the effect of cross-language re-
trieval of relevant texts in bilingual lexicon acqui-
sition from comparable corpora. First, we show
that, due to its computational complexity, it is dif-
ficult to straightforwardly apply previously stud-
ied techniques of bilingual term correspondence
estimation from comparable corpora, especially in
the case of large scale evaluation such as those
presented in this paper. Then, we show that,
with the help of cross-language retrieval of rel-
evant texts, this computational difficulty can be
easily avoided by reducing the candidate bilingual
term pairs against which bilingual term correspon-
dences are estimated. It is also experimentally
shown that candidate reduction with the help of
cross-language retrieval of relevant texts is quite
effective in improving the performance of precise
estimation of bilingual term correspondences.
2 Acquisition of Bilingual Term
Correspondences from Compa-
rable Corpora
Previously studied techniques of estimating bilin-
gual term correspondences from comparable cor-
pora are mostly based on the idea that semantically
similar words appear in similar contexts (Fung,
1995; Rapp, 1995; Kaji and Aizono, 1996;
Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung and Yee, 1998;
Rapp, 1999; Tanaka, 2002). In those techniques,
frequency information of contextual words co-
occurring in the monolingual text is stored and
their similarity is measured across languages.
The following gives a rough formalization of
the previous approaches to acquiring bilingual
term correspondences from comparable corpora.
Suppose that CCE and CCj denote an English
corpus and a Japanese corpus, respectively, and
that they can be considered as comparable cor-
pora. Then, in the previous approaches, for
each English term tE in CCE and each Japanese
term tj in CCj, occurrences of surrounding
words are recorded in the form of some vec-
tor cv (tE CCE ) and cv (t j. CCA, respectively l .
In most previous works, surrounding words that are con-
In previous works, as weights of these contex-
tual vectors, word frequencies or modified weights
such as tf • idf are used. Finally, for every pair
of an English term tE and a Japanese term tJ ,
bilingual term correspondence corrEj(tE,Q) is
estimated in terms of a certain similarity measure
sim(cv (tE, CCE ), cv (tj, CCJ)) between con-
textual vectors cv(tE, CCE) and cv(tj, CCJ):
corrEJ(tE,O) simEJ(cv(tE,CCE),cv(tj,CCJ))
Here, in the modeling of contextual sim-
ilarities across languages, earlier works
such as Fung (1995), Rapp (1995), and
Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996) studied to mea-
sure the similarities of contextual co-occurrence
patterns across languages without the help of any
existing bilingual lexicons. On the other hand,
later works such as Kaji and Aizono (1996),
Fung and Yee (1998), Rapp (1999), and
Tanaka (2002) studied to exploit existing bilingual
lexicons as initial seed for modeling of contextual
similarities across languages. As the similar-
ity measure sim(cv(tE , CCE ). cv(tJ . CCJ))
between contextual vectors cv(tE, CCE) and
cv(tj, CCj), measures such as cosine measure,
dice coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient are used.
3 Acquisition of Bilingual Term
Correspondences from Cross-
Lingually Relevant Texts
3.1 Cross-Language Retrieval of Rele-
vant News Articles
This section gives the overview of our framework
of cross-language retrieval of relevant news ar-
ticles from WWW news sites (Utsuro and oth-
ers, 2002). First, from WWW news sites, both
Japanese and English news articles within certain
range of dates are retrieved. Let dj and dE de-
note one of the retrieved Japanese and English arti-
cles, respectively. Then, each English article dE is
translated into a Japanese document d T by some
commercial MT software 2 . Each Japanese article
sidered as contexts of a term are those that co-occur in the
same sentence, or in a window of a few words.
2 In this query translation process, we also evaluated sim-
ply consulting a bilingual lexicon instead of employing an
MT software. As reported in Collier and others (1998), the
precision of simple word by word query translation with a
bilingual lexicon is much lower than that with an MT soft-
ware. Since we prefer precision rather than recall in our ex-
periments, in this paper, we show results with query transla-
tion by an MT software.
356
dj as well as the Japanese translation dij-/T of each
English article are next segmented into word se-
quences, and word frequency vectors v (d j) and
v (dlYT) are generated. Then, cosine similarities
between v (d j) and v (dr') are calculated 3 and
pairs of articles di and dE which satisfy certain
criterion are considered as candidates for "identi-
cal" or "relevant" article pairs.
As will be described in section 4.1, on WVVW
news sites in Japan, the number of articles updated
per day is far greater (5 ,-30 times) in Japanese
than in English. Thus, it is much easier to find
cross-lingually relevant articles for each English
query article than for each Japanese query arti-
cle. Considering this fact, we estimate bilingual
term correspondences from the results of cross-
lingually retrieving relevant Japanese articles with
English query articles. For each English query ar-
ticle diE in CCE and its Japanese translation d:}1Ti ,
the set D 9: j of Japanese articles with cosine similar-
ities higher than or equal to a certain lower bound
Ld is constructed:
= E CC.1 cos(v(dr i ),v(d.1)) > Ld} (1)
3.2 Estimating Bilingual Term Corre-
spondences
This section describes the techniques we apply to
the task of estimating bilingual term correspon-
dences from cross-lingually relevant texts. Here,
we compare several techniques in order to evaluate
the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant
texts in the performance of acquiring bilingual
term correspondences from comparable corpora.
In the first technique, we regard cross-lingually
relevant texts as a pseudo-parallel corpus, where
standard techniques of estimating bilingual term
correspondences from parallel corpora are em-
ployed. In the second technique, we regard cross-
lingually relevant texts as a comparable corpus,
where bilingual term correspondences are esti-
mated in terms of contextual similarities across
languages. In this second approach, we further
evaluate the effect of cross-language retrieval of
relevant texts by comparing the cases with/without
reducing candidates of bilingual term pairs with
the help of cross-lingually relevant text pairs.
3 1t is also quite possible to employ weights other than
word frequencies such as tridf and similarity measures other
than cosine measure such as dice or Jaccard coefficients. We
are planning to evaluate those alternatives in cross-language
retrieval of relevant news articles.
3.2.1 Estimation based on Pseudo-Parallel
Corpus
Here, we describe how to estimate bilingual
term correspondences from cross-lingually rele-
vant texts by regarding them as a pseudo-parallel
corpus. First, we concatenate constituent Japanese
articles of Dij into one article D, and regard the
article pair cliE and D as a pseudo-parallel sen-
tence pair. Next, we collect such pseudo-parallel
sentence pairs and construct a pseudo-parallel cor-
pus PPCEj
 of English and Japanese articles:
PPCEJ = {(diE , IY:11 ) _WI 0 0}
Then, we apply standard techniques of esti-
mating bilingual term correspondences from par-
allel corpora (Matsumoto and Utsuro, 2000) to
this pseudo-parallel corpus PPCEi . First, from a
pseudo-parallel sentence pair dtE and D , we ex-
tract monolingual (possibly compound) term pair
tE and tj :
ti) s.t.	 tE, d.1	 ti, cos(v(e Ti ). u(d.1))
	
La
(2)
where those term pairs are possibly required
to satisfy frequency lower bounds and the upper
bound of the number of constituent words. Then,
based on the contingency table of co-occurrence
frequencies of tE and t j below, we estimate bilin-
gual term correspondences according to the sta-
tistical measures such as the mutual information,
the 02 statistic, the dice coefficient, and the log-
likelihood ratio.
tj
tE	 freq(tE,0)= a	 freq(tE,—Itj) = b
tE freg(tE,tj)= c	 freg(tE,—,t, j) =d 
We compare the performance of those four mea-
sures, where the 0 2 statistic and the log-likelihood
ratio perform best, the dice coefficient the second
best, and the mutual information the worst. In sec-
tion 4.3, we show results with the C5 2 statistic as the
bilingual term correspondence corrEJ(tE,0):
(ad — bc) 202 (tE, t j )
(CI	 b)(a	 c)(b	 d)(c	 d)
3.2.2 Estimation based on Contextual Simi-
larity
Next, we describe how to estimate bilingual
term correspondences from cross-lingually rele-
vant texts by regarding them as a comparable cor-
pus. Here, when selecting the candidates of bilin-
gual term pairs against which bilingual term cor-
respondences are estimated, we evaluate two ap-
proaches. In the first approach, as described in
section 2 for the case of acquisition from compara-
ble corpora, for every pair of an English term and
a Japanese term, bilingual term correspondence is

estimated. In the second approach, on the other
hand, as described in the previous section for the
case of acquisition from (pseudo-) parallel cor-
pora, the candidates of bilingual term pairs are se-
lected from a pseudo-parallel sentence pair diE and
as in the formula (2). In this second approach,
we intend to evaluate the effect of cross-language
retrieval of relevant texts in the performance of ac-
quiring bilingual term correspondences from com-
parable corpora, i.e., in reducing useless bilingual
term pairs and in increasing the estimated confi-
dence of useful bilingual term pairs.
More specifically, first, a reduced but cross-
lingually more relevant comparable corpus is con-
structed from the result of cross-language retrieval
of relevant news articles in section 3.1. Referring
to the definition of the set D of relevant Japanese
articles in the equation (1), the reduced English
corpus RCE is constructed by collecting English
query articles each of which has at least one rele-
vant Japanese article:
RCE = (PE e CCE D
Next, the reduced Japanese corpus RCJ that is
cross-lingually relevant to RCE is constructed by
collecting those relevant Japanese articles:
RCJ U
cPE ERCE
Then, for each English term tE in RCE and
each Japanese term tj in RC, occurrences of
surrounding words are recorded in the form of
some vector cv(tE. RCE) and cv(tj. RCA, re-
spectively4 . Here, more precisely, the contextual
vector cv(tE. RCE) of an English term tE is con-
structed by summing up the word frequency vec-
tor v (sYT') of Japanese translation s lYT' of each
English sentence s contains tE:
CV(tE , RCE ) = 11( MTi8 )
v.siE in RcE s.t. tE esiE
4 In the experimental evaluation, we show results where
surrounding words that are considered as contexts of a term
are those that co-occur in the same sentence. We also ex-
perimentally evaluated weights of vectors other than word
frequencies such as t f • icif, , where its performance is quite
similar to that of word frequency vectors.
Finally,	 bilingual term correspondence
corrEj(tE,O) is estimated in terms of a certain
similarity measure simEj between contextual
vectors cv (tE, RCE) and cv j, RCA :
corrEj(tE,tj)	 Sin) E j(CV(tE, RCE), CV(i; j, RC j))
In the experimental evaluation, we show results
with cosine measure as the similarity measure
simEj (cv (tE RCE). cv (tj, RCA ). Here, when
selecting the candidates of bilingual term pairs, we
compare the two approaches mentioned above.
4 Experimental Evaluation
4.1 Japanese-English Relevant News Ar-
ticles on WWW News Sites
We collected Japanese and English news articles
from three WWW news sites A, B, and C. Table 1
shows the total number of collected articles and
the range of dates of those articles represented as
the number of days. Table 1 also shows the num-
ber of articles updated in one day, and the aver-
age article size. The number of Japanese articles
updated in one day are far greater (5 ,--, 30 times)
than that of English articles. Then, for each of the
three sites and for each of the two classes "iden-
tical"/"relevant", we manually collected 50 (i.e.,
50 x 3 x 2 = 300 in total) reference article pairs for
the evaluation of cross-language retrieval of rele-
vant news articles 5 . This evaluation result will be
presented in the next section.
4.2 Cross-Language Retrieval of Rele-
vant News Articles
We evaluate the performance of cross-language re-
trieval of "identical" I "relevant" reference ar-
ticle pairs (Utsuro and others, 2002). In the
direction of English to Japanese cross-language
retrieval, precision/recall rates of the reference

ence of dates between "identical" article pairs is less than
+ 5 days, and that between "relevant" article pairs is around
+ 10 days. We also examined the rates of whether at least
one cross-lingually "identical" article is available for each
retrieval query article (Utsuro and others, 2002). Cross-
lingually "identical" news articles are available in the direc-
tion of English-to-Japanese retrieval for more than half of the
retrieval query English articles.

In the case of "identical" article pairs, Japanese
articles with the similarity values above 0.4 have
precision of around 40% or more.
4.3 Estimation of Bilingual Term Corre-
spondences
For the news sites A, B, and C, and for several
lower bounds Ld of the similarity between English
and Japanese articles, Table 2 shows the num-
bers of English and Japanese articles which sat-
isfy the similarity lower bound (the difference of
dates of English and Japanese articles is given as
the maximum range of dates, with which all the
cross-lingually "identical" articles can be discov-
ered). In the evaluation of estimating bilingual
term correspondences, we divide the whole set
of estimated bilingual term correspondences into
subsets, where each subset consists of English and
Japanese term pairs which have a common En-
4.3.1 Numbers of Bilingual Term Pairs
First, for the site A with the similarity lower
bound Ld = 0.3, topmost 200 TP(tE ) according
to the maximum bilingual term correspondence
corrEJ(TP(tE)) are examined by hand and 146
bilingual term pairs contained in the topmost 200
TP(tE) are judged as correct. We compared
those 146 bilingual term pairs with an existing
bilingual lexicon (Eijiro Ver.37, 850,000 entries,
http://member.nifty.ne.jp/eijiro4
where 86 of them (almost 60%) are not included
in the existing bilingual lexicon. This manual
evaluation result indicates that it is quite possible
to extend a large scale existing bilingual lexicon
such as the one used in our evaluation.
Next, Table 3 lists the numbers of English
and Japanese monolingual terms, those of candi-
date term pairs against which bilingual term cor-
respondences are estimated, and those of term
pairs found in the existing bilingual lexicon. The
rows with "(without CUR)" show statistics for
the whole comparable corpus CCE and CCd.
The rows with "Ld (with CUR)" show lower
bounds of article similarities and statistics for the
cross-lingually relevant English corpus RCE and
Japanese corpus RCJ, that are reduced from the
whole comparable corpus CCE and CCd . The
columns with "reduced" show statistics when the
candidate bilingual term pairs are selected from
a pseudo-parallel sentence pair as in the formula
(2). The columns with "full" shows statistics when

It is very important to compare the column "rate
(full/reduced)" for the numbers of candidate term
pairs with that for the numbers of term pairs found
in the existing bilingual lexicon. The candidate
term pairs can be reduced to about 3.5 ,-40% of
their original sizes with the help of a pseudo-
parallel sentence pair, while about 37-50% of the
correct bilingual term pairs found in the existing
bilingual lexicon are preserved. Therefore, candi-
date reduction with the help of a pseudo-parallel
6 The computational complexity of bilingual term corre-
spondence estimation based on contextual similarity in com-
parable corpora (sections 2 and 3.2.2) is much more than
that based on pseudo-parallel corpus (section 3.2.1). The
whole process of estimating bilingual term correspondences
for "without CUR" (i.e., from the whole comparable corpus
CCE and CCJ by the technique described in section 2), for
the site A, would take about 6 days on a PentiumIV 1.9GHz
processor. For the sites B and C, Ld = 0.4, it would take 3 r•-•
6 days for the processes for "with CUR: full" (i.e., when the
candidates of bilingual term pairs are every pair of an English
term found in RCE and a Japanese term found in RC)) to
complete. Furthermore, in the case of such large scale exper-
iments as ours (e.g., for the sites B and C), where frequency
lower bounds are very low and compound terms are assumed
to be up to five words long, it would take more than half a
year for the processes for -without CLIR" to complete, un-
less with careful implementation.
sentence pair is quite effective in removing use-
less term pairs while preserving useful ones. This
result clearly supports our claim on the usefulness
of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in ac-
quisition of bilingual term correspondences.
4.3.2 Rates of Containing Correct Bilingual
Term Pairs
Next, we evaluate the following rate of containing
correct bilingual term correspondences:
{TP(tE) correct bilingual term
correspondence (I- E ,
	 E TP(tE)}
{ip (tE) TP (tE) 0 }
where the correctness of the estimated bilingual
term correspondences is judged against the exist-
ing bilingual lexicon. For the site A with the sim-
ilarity lower bound Ld = 0.4, Figure 3 plots the
changes in this rate against the order of TP(tE)
sorted by corrEJ(TP(tE)) (we have similar re-
sults with other similarity lower bounds L ci and
for other sites B and C). In the figure, "pseudo-
parallel with CUR" indicates the plot for estimat-
ing bilingual term correspondence based on the

as in the formula (2), while, in "full", the candi-
dates are every pair of an English term found in
RCE and a Japanese term found in RC,I.
For both "pseudo-parallel with CUR" and
"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced", the
number of bilingual term pairs found in the ex-
isting bilingual lexicon corresponds to the one in
the column with "reduced" in Table 3 (i.e., 543),
while, for "contextual similarity with CUR: full",
that number corresponds to the one in the col-
umn with "full" in Table 3 (i.e., 1467). The dif-
ferences of the rates in Figure 3 correspond to
the difference of these numbers (i.e., 1467 and
543). However, it is very important to note that,
for both "pseudo-parallel with CUR" and "con-
textual similarity with CUR: reduced", the rate
of containing correct bilingual term pairs tends
to decrease as the order of TP(tE) sorted by
corrEJ(TP(tE)) becomes lower. This tendency
indicates that the estimated values of bilingual
term correspondences have positive correlations
with the correctness of bilingual term pairs, which
supports the usefulness of the estimated bilingual
term correspondences. For "contextual similarity
with CUR: full", on the other hand, the rate of
containing correct bilingual term pairs seems to be
constant and thus the estimated values of bilingual
term correspondences do not seem useful. This re-
sult again supports our claim on the usefulness of
cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in acqui-
sition of bilingual term correspondences.
4.3.3 Ranks of Correct Bilingual Term Pairs
Finally, we evaluate the rank of correct bilingual
term correspondences within each set TP(tE ),
sorted by the estimated bilingual term correspon-
dence corrEj (tE ,tj). Within a set TP(tE ), es-

timated Japanese term translation tj are sorted by
corrEj (tE .tj ), and the ranks of correct Japanese
translation of tE are recorded. For the site A with
the similarity lower bounds Ld = 0.3. 0.4, 0.5,
Figure 4 shows this distribution for the correct
bilingual term pairs, which are contained in the
topmost 200 TP(tE ) and are found in the existing
bilingual lexicon (we have similar results for other
sites B and C). Here, we compare this distribution
among "pseudo-parallel with CUR", "contextual
similarity with CUR: reduced", and "contextual
similarity with CUR: full".
For all the similarity lower bounds Ld, "pseudo-
parallel with CUR" performs best, where about
85-,90% of correct bilingual term pairs are in-
cluded within the 5-best candidates in each
TP(tE ), and about 90 ,-400% are included within
the 10-best. Here, it is important to note that bilin-
gual term correspondence estimation by "pseudo-
parallel with CUR" has another advantage over
that by "contextual similarity with CUR: re-
duced/full" in terms of computational complex-
ity. Also note that the performance of "pseudo-
parallel with CUR" is affected little by the sim-
ilarity lower bounds Ld. On the other hand, for
"contextual similarity with CUR: reduced/full",
the performance becomes worse as the similarity
lower bound Ld becomes smaller and the cross-
lingually relevant English/Japanese corpus RCE
and RCJ becomes noisier. More specifically,
for "full", as the similarity lower bound Ld be-
comes smaller, more and more correct bilingual
term pairs become outside of the 100-best candi-
dates7 . For "reduced", the rate of correct bilin-
gual term pairs included within the 5-best candi-
dates decreases from 70 to 40%, and that within
the 10-best decreases from 73 to 45%, as the sim-
ilarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller. Further-
more, "reduced" outperforms "full" and their per-
formance gap seems to become larger as the sim-
ilarity lower bound Ld becomes larger. To sum-
marize those results, candidate reduction with the
help of a pseudo-parallel sentence pair is quite ef-
fective also in the precise estimation of bilingual
7 We manually examined all of those bilingual term pairs
that are judged as "correct" against the existing bilingual lex-
icon. We confirmed that most of those outside of the 100-
best candidates are not translation of each other in the cross-
lingually relevant text pairs.

5 Related Works
As we showed in section 4.3.1, in large scale
experimental evaluation of bilingual term corre-
spondence estimation from comparable corpora,
it is difficult to estimate bilingual term corre-
spondences against every possible pair of terms
due to its computational complexity. Previous
works on bilingual term correspondence estima-
tion from comparable corpora controlled experi-
mental evaluation in various ways in order to re-
duce this computational complexity. For example,
Rapp (1999) filtered out bilingual term pairs with
low monolingual frequencies (those below 100
times), while Fung and Yee (1998) restricted can-
didate bilingual term pairs to be pairs of the most
frequent 118 unknown words. Tanaka (2002) re-
stricted candidate bilingual compound term pairs
by consulting a seed bilingual lexicon and requir-
ing their constituent words to be translation of
each other across languages. In this paper, on
the other hand, we showed in section 4.3.1 that,
due to its computational complexity, it is diffi-
cult to straightforwardly apply previously studied
techniques of bilingual term correspondence es-
timation from comparable corpora, especially in
the case of large scale evaluation such as those
presented in this paper. Then, we showed that
this computational difficulty can be easily avoided
with the help of cross-language retrieval of rele-
vant texts without harming the performance of pre-
cisely estimating bilingual term correspondences.
6 Conclusion
Within the framework of translation knowledge
acquisition from WWW news sites, we studied is-
sues on the effect of cross-language retrieval of
relevant texts in bilingual lexicon acquisition from
comparable corpora. We showed that it is quite ef-
fective to reduce the candidate bilingual term pairs
against which bilingual term correspondences are
estimated, in terms of both computational com-
plexity and the performance of precise estimation
of bilingual term correspondences.
