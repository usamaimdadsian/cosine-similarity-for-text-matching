Abstract
The paper describes a cross-lingual
document retrieval system in the medical
domain that employs a controlled vocabu-
lary (UMLS I ) in constructing an XML-
based intermediary representation into
which queries as well as documents are
mapped. The system assists in the re-
trieval of English and German medical
scientific abstracts relevant to a German
query document (electronic patient re-
cord). The modularity of the system al-
lows for deployment in other domains,
given appropriate linguistic and semantic
resources.
1 Introduction
The task of a cross-language information re-
trieval (CUR) system is to match user queries
specified in one language against documents
written in a different language. In recent years,
three approaches to the CUR problem have been
investigated: query translation, document transla-
tion and the use of an interlingua as specified in
thesauri and similar semantic resources. The sys-
tem2 we describe here (MuchMore*) approaches
the CUR task by automatically mapping both the
queries and documents into an intermediary
1 The Unified Medical Language System
(http://umls.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/) integrates informa-
tion from multiple machine-readable biomedical information
sources.
2 The system described here emerged in the context of the
MuchMore project in close cooperation between two project
partners. It is an integral part of the MuchMore prototype,
which integrates additional CUR approaches by other part-
ners.
XML-based representation by means of a multi-
lingual medical thesaurus. The controlled vo-
cabulary used, the Metathesaurus (or rather the
MeSH3 part of this), is one of the three knowl-
edge sources developed within the UMLS con-
taining semantic information about biomedical
concepts, their various names and the specific
relationships among them (i.e. broader_term, nar-
rower_term, etc.). In addition we used the UMLS
Semantic Network as a further knowledge
source, which provides a categorization of the
Metathesaurus concepts in semantic types and
provides links between these types through rela-
tionships that are important for the biomedical
domain (i.e. location_of, leads_to, etc.).
2 The MuchMore* Platform
At its core, MuchMore* is a multitier application
configured as a client tier to provide a user inter-
face, a middle tier annotation module that gener-

ates the intermediary data representation, and a
back-end tier consisting of a search engine sys-
tem to provide the retrieval technology (see Fig-
ure 1.).
2.1 Query and Document Annotation
The middle tier annotation module consists of
more subtiers representing an advanced annota-
tion system that automatically identifies a num-
ber of relevant linguistic and semantic features.
Components for part-of-speech tagging (Brants,
2000), morphological analysis (Petitpierre and
Russell., 1995), phrase tagging (chunking) (Skut
and Brants., 1998), concept and semantic rela-
tions annotation are being loosely integrated,
through input-output markup interfaces, and gen-
erate an intermediary XML representation (Vin-
tar et al., 2001) of the input data (see Figure 2.).
Semantic annotation represents the pri-
mary information that the retrieval system is us-
ing. Crossing the language barrier from a query
in one language to the document collection in
another language is done via concept codes as an
interlingua representation. The multilingual en-
tries for UMLS concepts make possible the map-
ping of lexical items to an intermediate
representation (concept codes) to bridge the gap
between different languages. For example, the
German word 'Herzinfarkt' in a query will be
mapped to the same UMLS code as the English
word 'myocardial infarction in the documents.
The loose integration of the abovemen-
tioned components, through their ability to both
produce and consume XML data, is an extremely
flexible way for reuse. Through substitution or
further chaining of such components the annota-
tion can be extended to embrace a diverse set of
domains beside the medical one.
2.2 Query Processing
The entry point to the MuchMore* system is a
query-processing interface that provides a user
interface for completing or refining query con-
struction (see Figure 3). For this purpose, the fol-
lowing information is displayed:
• the text of the query', serving as reference
context for any further refinements
• a list of automatically extracted medical con-
cepts along with their frequency and the se-
mantic relations holding among the concepts

order of spatial and object-based attention, disturbed spatial perception and
representation, and optic ataxia resulting from bilateral parieto-occipital
lesions.

Figure 3. Query Processing Interface
• a browsing option that helps the user to navi-
gate through the concept space (MeSH) and
include more general or more specific con-
cepts in the constructed query
The concept list consists of preferred names of
the matched terminology, as found in the con-
trolled vocabulary. Furthermore, on clicking the
frequency number associated with a concept, all
its instances in the query are highlighted.
Thereby the user is not only presented with a
normalized medical terminology, according to
the controlled vocabulary, but he can also inspect
which terms in the query document are instances
of which concepts. A list of semantic relations
that hold between co-occurring concepts is dis-
played for each concept. When the user clicks on
a listed relation, the context of the relation and its
concepts are highlighted, helping the user to
make an informed choice on the relevance of the
automatically extracted relation.
For query expansion we provide a browse able
contextual view of a concept according to the
MeSH hierarchy. By selecting any concept in the
generated list an overview is given of ancestor,
sibling and child concepts. By double-clicking
any of these, the query can be extended in a way
that is relevant to the user needs, with the added
concepts shown in a text area below the original
concept list. The text area can be directly edited
to append new terms to the query, which the user
considers relevant but were neither automatically
extracted nor available through MeSH browsing.
Once the query has been refined according to
the user needs, the underlying information about
233
tokens, lemmas, concept codes and their relations
is sent to the retrieval engine.
2.3 Indexing and Retrieval
The back-end tier of the system is a retrieval en-
gine with XML-based indexing support. It allows
to index any linguistic or semantic feature from
the intermediary XML document representation.
All content words of the documents are indexed
as word forms and as base forms (lemmas),
whereby, for compounds, base forms are being
computed by segmenting them into single words
(e.g. Nociceptilspiegel 4 Nociceptin, Spiegel).
In addition all semantic codes (MeSH and UMLS
codes as well as semantic relations) are indexed
in separate classes. Information relevant to a user
query is being retrieved through a vector space
similarity match between words, concepts and
semantic relations on the query and document
side. Evidence from multiple indexing features
are automatically combined into the computation
of the relevancy value for each document.
The result page displays a list of relevant
documents in a descending order and a list of
concepts and semantic relations that the query
consists of. For viewing the content of any re-
trieved document, a user interface similar to the
query processing's view has been implemented,
whereby the matched concepts and relations are
being highlighted.
As one of the goals of the project is to com-
pare the performance of different document re-
trieval methods, the system allows for switching
between the semantic retrieval engine presented
above and other retrieval engines developed in
the context of the project by other partners. Fur-
thermore, a meta-search option allows the end
user to query a combination of the available re-
trieval engines by merging different scoring
schemes in one unified result list with the most
relevant documents ranked topmost.
3 Future Work
A next release of the system will add functional-
ity with respect to the following topics:
• Sense Disambiguation and
•
Relation Filtering
Sense Disambiguation Ambiguity is one of the
inherent problems to deal with in the context of
semantic annotation. The problem is that a word
or even a complex term may have different
meanings, i.e. concepts to be annotated with. The
system will therefore be extended with a sense
disambiguation component in the middle tier to
tackle this problem. This component will choose,
the most appropriate UMLS concept for a term
according to the context.
Relation Filtering Given the UMLS Semantic
Network, relations can also be ambiguous. That
is, two concepts can be related in several ways as
illustrated by the following example:
Diagnostic Procedure analyzes Antibiotic
Diagnostic Procedure measures Antibiotic
Diagnostic Procedure uses Antibiotic
For this purpose, a relation-filtering component
will be added that selects the correct relation by
means of lexical markers, such as verbs, and by a
measure of context relevancy.
