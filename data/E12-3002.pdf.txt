Abstract
Classifying text genres across languages
can bring the benefits of genre classifi-
cation to the target language without the
costs of manual annotation. This article
introduces the first approach to this task,
which exploits text features that can be con-
sidered stable genre predictors across lan-
guages. My experiments show this method
to perform equally well or better than
full text translation combined with mono-
lingual classification, while requiring fewer
resources.
1 Introduction
Automated text classification has become stan-
dard practice with applications in fields such as
information retrieval and natural language pro-
cessing. The most common basis for text clas-
sification is by topic (Joachims, 1998; Sebas-
tiani, 2002), but other classification criteria have
evolved, including sentiment (Pang et al., 2002),
authorship (de Vel et al., 2001; Stamatatos et al.,
2000a), and author personality (Oberlander and
Nowson, 2006), as well as categories relevant to
filter algorithms (e.g., spam or inappropriate con-
tents for minors).
Genre is another text characteristic, often de-
scribed as orthogonal to topic. It has been shown
by Biber (1988) and others after him, that the
genre of a text affects its formal properties. It is
therefore possible to use cues (e.g., lexical, syn-
tactic, structural) from a text as features to pre-
dict its genre, which can then feed into informa-
tion retrieval applications (Karlgren and Cutting,
1994; Kessler et al., 1997; Finn and Kushmer-
ick, 2006; Freund et al., 2006). This is because
users may want documents that serve a particu-
lar communicative purpose, as well as being on
a particular topic. For example, a web search on
the topic “crocodiles” may return an encyclopedia
entry, a biological fact sheet, a news report about
attacks in Australia, a blog post about a safari ex-
perience, a fiction novel set in South Africa, or
a poem about wildlife. A user may reject many
of these, just because of their genre: Blog posts,
poems, novels, or news reports may not contain
the kind or quality of information she is seeking.
Having classified indexed texts by genre would al-
low additional selection criteria to reflect this.
Genre classification can also benefit Language
Technology indirectly, where differences in the
cues that correlate with genre may impact sys-
tem performance. For example, Petrenz and
Webber (2011) found that within the New York
Times corpus (Sandhaus, 2008), the word “states”
has a higher likelihood of being a verb in let-
ters (approx. 20%) than in editorials (approx.
2%). Part-of-Speech (PoS) taggers or statistical
machine translation (MT) systems could benefit
from knowing such genre-based domain varia-
tion. Kessler et al. (1997) mention that parsing
and word-sense disambiguation can also benefit
from genre classification. Webber (2009) found
that different genres have a different distribution
of discourse relations, and Goldstein et al. (2007)
showed that knowing the genre of a text can also
improve automated summarization algorithms, as
genre conventions dictate the location and struc-
ture of important information within a document.
All the above work has been done within a
single language. Here I describe a new ap-
proach to genre classification that is cross-lingual.
Cross-lingual genre classification (CLGC) differs
11
from both poly-lingual and language-independent
genre classification. CLGC entails training a
genre classification model on a set of labeled texts
written in a source language LS and using this
model to predict the genres of texts written in the
target language LT 6= LS . In poly-lingual classi-
fication, the training set is made up of texts from
two or more languages S = {LS1 , . . . , LSN } that
include the target language LT ? S. Language-
independent classification approaches are mono-
lingual methods that can be applied to any lan-
guage. Unlike CLGC, both poly-lingual and
language-independent genre classification require
labeled training data in the target language.
Supervised text classification requires a large
amount of labeled data. CLGC attempts to lever-
age the available annotated data in well-resourced
languages like English in order to bring the afore-
mentioned advantages to poorly-resourced lan-
guages. This reduces the need for manual annota-
tion of text corpora in the target language. Manual
annotation is an expensive and time-consuming
task, which, where possible, should be avoided
or kept to a minimum. Considering the difficul-
ties researchers are encountering in compiling a
genre reference corpus for even a single language
(Sharoff et al., 2010), it is clear that it would be in-
feasible to attempt the same for thousands of other
languages.
2 Prior work
Work on automated genre classification was first
carried out by Karlgren and Cutting (1994). Like
Kessler et al. (1997) and Argamon et al. (1998)
after them, they exploit (partly) hand-crafted sets
of features, which are specific to texts in English.
These include counts of function words such as
“we” or “therefore”, selected PoS tag frequen-
cies, punctuation cues, and other statistics derived
from intuition or text analysis. Similarly lan-
guage specific feature sets were later explored for
mono-lingual genre classification experiments in
German (Wolters and Kirsten, 1999) and Russian
(Braslavski, 2004).
In subsequent research, automatically gener-
ated feature sets have become more popular. Most
of these tend to be language-independent and
might work in mono-lingual genre classification
tasks in languages other than English. Examples
are the word based approaches suggested by Sta-
matatos et al. (2000b) and Freund et al. (2006),
the image features suggested by Kim and Ross
(2008), the PoS histogram frequency approach by
Feldman et al. (2009), and the character n-gram
approaches proposed by Kanaris and Stamatatos
(2007) and Sharoff et al. (2010). All of them
were tested exclusively on English texts. While
language-independence is a popular argument of-
ten claimed by authors, few have shown empir-
ically that this is true of their approach. One
of the few authors to carry out genre classifica-
tion experiments in more than one language was
Sharoff (2007). Using PoS 3-grams and a vari-
ation of common word 3-grams as feature sets,
Sharoff classified English and Russian documents
into genre categories. However, while the PoS 3-
gram set yielded respectable prediction accuracy
for English texts, in Russian documents, no im-
provement over the baseline of choosing the most
frequent genre class was observed.
While there is virtually no prior work on
CLGC, cross-lingual methods have been explored
for other text classification tasks. The first to
report such experiments were Bel et al. (2003),
who predicted text topics in Spanish and En-
glish documents, using one language for train-
ing and the other for testing. Their approach in-
volves training a classifier on language A, using a
document representation containing only content
words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs with a high
corpus frequency). These words are then trans-
lated from language B to language A, so that texts
in either language are mapped to a common rep-
resentation.
Thereafter, cross-lingual text classification was
typically regarded as a domain adaptation prob-
lem that researchers have tried to solve using large
sets of unlabeled data and/or small sets of labeled
data in the target language. For instance, Rigutini
et al. (2005) present an EM algorithm in which
labeled source language documents are translated
into the target language and then a classifier is
trained to predict labels on a large, unlabeled
set in the target language. These instances are
then used to iteratively retrain the classification
model and the predictions are updated until con-
vergence occurs. Using information gain scores
at every iteration to only retain the most predic-
tive words and thus reduce noise, Rigutini et al.
(2005) achieve a considerable improvement over
the baseline accuracy, which is a simple trans-
lation of the training instances and subsequent
12
mono-lingual classification. They, too, were clas-
sifying texts by topics and used a collection of
English and Italian newsgroup messages. Simi-
larly, researchers have used semi-supervised boot-
strapping methods like co-training (Wan, 2009)
and other domain adaptation methods like struc-
tural component learning (Prettenhofer and Stein,
2010) to carry out cross-lingual text classification.
All of the approaches described above rely on
MT, even if some try to keep translation to a
minimum. This has several disadvantages how-
ever, as applications become dependent on par-
allel corpora, which may not be available for
poorly-resourced languages. It also introduces
problems due to word ambiguity and morphol-
ogy, especially where single words are translated
out of context. A different method is proposed
by Gliozzo and Strapparava (2006), who use la-
tent semantic analysis on a combined collection
of texts written in two languages. The ratio-
nale is that named entities such as “Microsoft” or
“HIV” are identical in different languages with
the same writing system. Using term correla-
tion, the algorithm can identify semantically sim-
ilar words in both languages. The authors exploit
these mappings in cross-lingual topic classifica-
tion, and their results are promising. However,
using bilingual dictionaries as well yields a con-
siderable improvement, as Gliozzo and Strappar-
ava (2006) also report.
While all of the methods above could techni-
cally be used in any text classification task, the id-
iosyncrasies of genres pose additional challenges.
Techniques relying on the automated translation
of predictive terms (Bel et al., 2003; Prettenhofer
and Stein, 2010) are workable in the contexts of
topics and sentiment, as these typically rely on
content words such as nouns, adjectives, and ad-
verbs. For example, “hospital” may indicate a
text from the medical domain, while “excellent”
may indicate that a review is positive. Such terms
are relatively easy to translate, even if not always
without uncertainty. Genres, on the other hand,
are often classified using function words (Karl-
gren and Cutting, 1994; Stamatatos et al., 2000b)
like “of”, “it”, or “in”. It is clear that translating
these out of context is next to impossible. This is
true in particular if there are differences in mor-
phology, since function words in one language
may be morphological affixes in another.
Although it is theoretically possible to use the
bilingual low-dimension approach by Gliozzo and
Strapparava (2006) for genre classification, it re-
lies on certain words to be identical in two dif-
ferent languages. While this may be the case for
topic-indicating named entities — a text contain-
ing the words “Obama” and “McCain” will al-
most certainly be about the U.S. elections in 2008,
or at least about U.S. politics — there is little in-
dication of what its genre might be: It could be
a news report, an editorial, a letter, an interview,
a biography, or a blog entry, just to name a few.
Because topics and genres correlate, one would
probably reject some genres like instruction man-
uals or fiction novels. However, uncertainty is still
large, and Petrenz and Webber (2011) show that
it can be dangerous to rely on such correlations.
This is particularly true in the cross-lingual case,
as it is not clear whether genres and topics corre-
late in similar ways in a different language.
3 Approach
The approach I propose here relies on two strate-
gies I explain below in more detail: Stable fea-
tures and target language adaptation. The first
is based on the assumption that certain features
are indicative of certain genres in more than one
language, while the latter is a less restricted way
to boost performance, once the language gap has
been bridged. Figure 1 illustrates this approach,
which is a challenging one, as very little prior
knowledge is assumed by the system. On the
other hand, in theory it allows any resulting appli-
cation to be used for a wide range of languages.
3.1 Assumption of prior knowledge
Typically, the aim of cross-lingual techniques is to
leverage the knowledge present in one language
in order to help carry a task in another language,
for which such knowledge is not available. In the
case of genre classification, this knowledge com-
prises genre labels of the documents used to train
the classification model. My approach requires no
labeled data in the target language. This is impor-
tant, as some domain adaptation algorithms rely
on a small set of labeled texts in the target do-
main.
Cross-lingual methods also often rely on MT,
but this effectively restricts them to languages
for which MT is sufficiently developed. Apart
from the fact that it would be desirable for a
cross-lingual genre classifier to work for as many

languages as possible, MT only allows classi-
fication in well-resourced languages. However,
such languages are more likely to have genre-
annotated corpora, and mono-lingual classifica-
tion may yield better results. In order to bring
the advantages of genre classification to poorly-
resourced languages, the availability of MT tech-
niques, at least for the time being, must not be
assumed. I only use them to generate baseline re-
sults.
The same restriction is applied to other types of
prior knowledge, and I do not assume supervised
PoS taggers, syntactic parsers, or other tools are
available. In future work however, I may explore
unsupervised methods, such as the PoS induction
methods of Clark (2003), Goldwater and Griffiths
(2007), or Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2010), as they
do not represent external knowledge.
There are a few assumptions that must be made
in order to carry out any meaningful experiments.
First, some way to detect sentence and paragraph
boundaries is expected. This can be a simple rule-
based algorithm, or unsupervised methods, such
as the Punkt boundary detection system by Kiss
and Strunk (2006). Also, punctuation symbols
and numerals are assumed to be identifiable as
such, although their exact semantic function is un-
known. For example, a question mark will be
identified as a punctuation symbol, but its func-
tion (question cue; end of a sentence) will not.
Lastly, a sufficiently large, unlabeled set of texts
in the target language is required.
3.2 Stable features
Many types of features have been used in genre
classification. They all fall into one of three
groups: Language-specific features are cues
which can only be extracted from texts in one lan-
guage. An example would be the frequency of a
particular word, such as “yesterday”. Language-
independent features can be extracted in any lan-
guage, but they are not necessarily directly com-
parable. Examples would be the frequencies of
the ten most common words. While these can be
extracted for any language (as long as words can
be identified as such), the function of a word on
a certain position in this ranking will likely differ
from one language to another. Comparable fea-
tures, on the other hand, represent the same func-
tion, or part of a function, in two or more lan-
guages. An example would be type/token ratios,
which, in combination with the document length,
represent the lexical richness of a text, indepen-
dent of its language. If such features prove to
be good genre predictors across languages, they
may be considered stable across those languages.
Once suitable features are found, CLGC may be
considered a standard classification problem, as
outlined in the upper part of Figure 1.
I propose an approach that makes use of such
stable features, which include mostly structural,
rather than lexical cues (cf. Section 4). Stable
features lend themselves to the classification of
genres in particular. As already mentioned, gen-
res differ in communicative purpose, rather than
in topic. Therefore, features involving content
words are only useful to an extent. While topical
classification is hard to imagine without transla-
tion or parallel/comparable corpora, genre classi-
fication can be done without such resources. Sta-
ble features provide a way to bridge the language
gap even to poorly-resourced languages.
This does not necessarily mean that the values
of these attributes are in the same range across
languages. For example, the type/token ratio will
typically be higher in morphologically-rich lan-
guages. However, it might still be true that novels
have a richer vocabulary than scientific articles,
whether they are written in English or Finnish. In
14
order to exploit such features cross-linguistically,
their values have to be mapped from one language
to another. This can be done in an unsupervised
fashion, as long as enough data is present in both
source and target language (cf. Section 3.1). An
easy and intuitive way is to standardize values so
that each feature in both sets has a mean value of
zero mean and variance of one. This is achieved
by subtracting from each feature value the mean
over all documents and dividing it by the standard
deviation.
Note that the training and test sets have to be
standardized separately in order for both sets to
have the same mean and variance and thus be
comparable. This is different from classification
tasks where training and test set are assumed to
be sampled from the same distribution. Although
standardization (or another type of scaling) is of-
ten performed in such tasks as well, the scaling
factor from the training set would be used to scale
the test set (Hsu et al., 2000).
3.3 Target language adaptation
Cross-lingual text classification has often been
considered a special case of domain adap-
tation. Semi-supervised methods, such as
the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
(Dempster et al., 1977), have been employed to
make use of both labeled data in the source lan-
guage and unlabeled data in the target language.
However, adapting to a different language poses a
greater challenge than adapting to different gen-
res, topics, or sources. As the vocabularies have
little (if any) overlap, it is not trivial to initially
bridge the gap between the domains. Typically,
MT would be used to tackle this problem.
Instead, my use of stable features shifts the fo-
cus of subsequent domain adaptation to exploiting
unlabeled data in the target language to improve
prediction accuracy. I refer to this as target lan-
guage adaptation (TLA). The advantage of mak-
ing this separation is that a different set of features
can be used to adapt to the target language. There
is no reason to keep the restrictions required for
stable features once the language gap has been
bridged. In fact, any language-independent fea-
ture may be used for this task. The assumption is
that the method described in Section 3.2 provides
a good but enhanceable result, that is significantly
below mono-lingual performance. The resulting
decent, though imperfect, labeling of target lan-
guage texts may be exploited to improve accuracy.
A wide range of possible features lend them-
selves to TLA. Language-independent features
have often been proposed in prior work on genre
classification. These include bag-of-words, char-
acter n-grams, and PoS frequencies or PoS n-
grams, although the latter two would have to be
based on the output of unsupervised PoS induc-
tion algorithms in this scenario. Alternatively,
PoS tags could be approximated by considering
the most frequent words as their own tag, as sug-
gested by Sharoff (2007). With appropriate fea-
ture sets, iterative algorithms can be used to im-
prove the labeling of the set in the target domain.
The lower part of Figure 1 illustrates the TLA
process proposed for CLGC. In each iteration,
confidence values obtained from the previous
classification model are used to select a subset of
labeled texts in the target language. Intuitively,
only texts which can be confidently assigned to
a certain genre should be used to train a new
model. This is particularly true in the first iter-
ation, after the stable feature prediction, as error
rates are expected to be high. The size of this
subset is increased at each iteration in the process
until it comprises all the texts in the test set. A
multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) in a
k genre problem is a combination of k×(k?1)2 bi-
nary classifiers with voting to determine the over-
all prediction. To compute a confidence value for
this prediction, I use the geometric mean G =
(
?n
i=1 ai)
1/n of the distances from the decision
boundary ai for all the n binary classifiers, which
include the winning genre (i.e., n = k ? 1). The
geometric mean heavily penalizes low values, that
is small distances to the hyperplane separating
two genres. This corresponds to the intuition that
there should be a high certainty in any pairwise
genre comparison for a high-confidence predic-
tion. Negative distances from the boundary are
counted as zero, which reduces the overall confi-
dence to zero. The acquired subset is then trans-
formed to a bag of words representation. Inspired
by the approach of Rigutini et al. (2005), the in-
formation gain for each feature is computed, and
only the highest ranked features are used. A new
classification model is trained and used to re-label
the target language texts. This process continues
until convergence (i.e., labels in two subsequent
iterations are identical) or until a pre-defined iter-
ation limit is reached.
15
4 Experiments
4.1 Baselines
To verify the proposed approach, I carried out ex-
periments using two publicly available corpora in
English and in Chinese. As there is no prior work
on CLGC, I chose as baseline an SVM model
trained on the source language set using a bag of
words representation as features. This had pre-
viously been used for this task by Freund et al.
(2006) and Sharoff et al. (2010).1 The texts in
the test set were then translated from the target
into the source language using Google translate2
and the SVM model was used to predict their gen-
res. I also tested a variant in which the training set
was translated into the target language before the
feature extraction step, with the test set remaining
untranslated. Note that these are somewhat artifi-
cial baselines, as MT in reasonable quality is only
available for a few selected languages. They are
therefore not workable solutions to classify gen-
res in poorly-resourced languages. Thus, even a
cross-lingual performance close to these baselines
can be considered a success, as long as no MT
is used. For reference, I also report the perfor-
mances of a random guess approach and a classi-
fier labeling each text as the dominant genre class.
With all experiments, results are reported for
the test set in the target language. I infer confi-
dence intervals by assuming that the number of
misclassifications is approximately normally dis-
tributed with mean µ = e × n and standard devi-
ation ? =
?
µ× (1? e), where e is the percent-
age of misclassified instances and n is the size of
the test set. I take two classification results to dif-
fer significantly only if their 95% confidence in-
tervals (i.e., µ± 1.96× ?) do not overlap.
4.2 Data
In line with some of the prior mono-lingual work
on genre classification, I used the Brown corpus
for my experiments. As illustrated in Table 1,
the 500 texts in the corpus are sampled from 15
genres, which can be categorized more broadly
into four broad genre categories, and even more
broadly into informative and imaginative texts.
The second corpus I used was the Lancaster Cor-
pus of Mandarin Chinese (LCMC). In creating the
1Other document representations, including character n-
grams, were tested, but found to perform worse in this task.

LCMC, the Brown sampling frame was followed

are comparable, with the exception of Western
Fiction, which was replaced by Martial Arts Fic-
tion in the LCMC. Texts in both corpora are tok-
enized by word, sentence, and paragraph, and no
further pre-processing steps were necessary.
Following Karlgren and Cutting (1994), I
tested my approach on all three levels of granu-
larity. However, as the 15-genre task yields rela-
tively poor CLGC results (both for my approach
and the baselines), I report and discuss only the
results of the two and four-genre task here. Im-
proving performance on more fine-grained genres
will be subject of future work (cf. Section 6).
4.3 Features and Parameters
The stable features used to bridge the language
gap are listed in Table 2. Most are simply ex-
tractable cues that have been used in mono-lingual
genre classification experiments before: Average
sentence/paragraph lengths and standard devia-
tions, type/token ratio and numeral/token ratio.
To these, I added a ratio of single lines in a text —
that is, paragraphs containing no more than one
sentence, divided by the sentence count. These
are typically headlines, datelines, author names,
or other structurally interesting parts. A distribu-
tion value indicates how evenly single lines are
distributed throughout a text, with high values in-
dicating single lines predominantly occurring at
the beginning and/or end of a text.

I used tf-idf weighting and marked the ten high-
est weighted words in a text as relevant. I then
treated this text as a ranked list of relevant and
non-relevant words, where the position of a word
in the text determined its rank. This allowed me to
compute an average precision (AP) value. The in-
tuition behind this value is that genre conventions
dictate the location of important content words
within a text. A high AP score means that the top
tf-idf weighted words are found predominantly in
the beginning of a text. In addition, for the same
ten words, I added the tf-idf value to the feature
set, divided by the sum of all ten. These values
indicate whether a text is very focused (a sharp
drop between higher and lower ranked words) or
more spread out across topics (relatively flat dis-
tribution).
For each of these features, Table 2 shows the
mean values for the four broad genre classes in
the LCMC and Brown corpus, after the sets have
been standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
This is the same preprocessing process used for
training and testing the SVM model, although the
statistics in Table 2 are not available to the clas-
sifier, since they require genre labels. Each row
gives an idea of how suitable a feature might be
to distinguish between these genres in Chinese
(upper row) and English (lower row). Both rows
together indicate how stable a feature is across
languages for this task. Some features, such as
the topic AP value, seems to be both a good pre-
dictor for genre and stable across languages. In
both Chinese and English, for example, the topi-
cal words seem to be concentrated around the be-
ginning of the text in Non-Fiction, but much less
so in Fiction. These patterns can be seen in other
features as well. The type/token ratio is, on av-
erage, highest in Press texts, followed by Miscel-
laneous texts, Fiction texts, and Non-Fiction texts
in both corpora. While this does not hold for all
the features, many such patterns can be observed
in Table 2.
Since uncertainty after the initial prediction is
very high, the subset used to re-train the SVM
model was chosen to be small. In the first iter-
ation, I used up to 60% of texts with the highest
confidence value within each genre. To avoid an
imbalanced class distribution, texts were chosen
so that the genre distribution in the new training
set matched the one in the source language. To il-
lustrate this, consider an example with two genre
classes A and B, represented by 80% and 20% of
texts respectively in the source language. Assum-
ing that after the initial prediction both classes are
assigned to 100 texts in a test set of size 200, the
60 texts with the highest confidence values would
be chosen for class A. To keep the genre distribu-
tion of the source language, only the top 15 texts
would be chosen for class B.
In the second iteration, I simply used the top
90% of texts overall. This number was increased
by 5% in each subsequent iteration, so that the full
set was used from the fourth iteration. No changes
were made to the genre distribution from the sec-
ond iteration. To train the classification model,
I used the 500 features with the highest informa-

5 Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the accuracies for the two genre
task (informative texts vs. imaginative texts) in
both directions: English as a source language with
Chinese being the target language (en?zh) and
vice versa (zh?en). As the class distribution is
skewed (374 vs. 126 texts), always predicting
the most dominant class yields acceptable perfor-
mance. However, this is simplistic and might fail
in practice, where the most dominant class will
typically be unknown.
Full text translation combined with mono-
lingual classification performs well. Stable fea-
tures alone yield a respectable prediction accu-
racy, but perform significantly worse than MT
Source in both tasks and MT Target in the zh?en
task. However, subsequent TLA significantly im-
proves the accuracy on both tasks, eliminating any
significant difference from baseline performance.
Figure 3 shows results for the four genre clas-
sification task (Fiction vs. Non-Fiction vs. Press
vs. Misc.). Again, MT Source and MT Target
perform well. However, translating from Chinese
into English yields better results than the reverse.
This might be due to the easier identification of

words in English and thus a more accurate bag
of words representation. TLA manages to signif-
icantly improve the stable feature results. My ap-
proach outperforms both baselines in this experi-
ment, although the differences are only significant
if texts are translated from English to Chinese.
These results are encouraging, as they show
that in CLGC tasks, equal or better performance
can be achieved with fewer resources, when com-
pared the baseline of full text translation. The rea-
son why TLA works well in this case can be un-
derstood by comparing the confusion matrices be-
fore the first iteration and after convergence (Ta-
ble 3). While it is obvious that the stable fea-
ture approach works better on some classes than
on others, the distributions of predicted and ac-
tual genres are fairly similar. For Fiction, Non-
Fiction, and Press, precision is above 50%, with
correct predictions outweighing incorrect ones,
which is an important basis for subsequent it-
erative learning. However, too many texts are
predicted to belong to the Miscellaneous cate-
gory, which reduces recall on the other genres.
By using a different feature set and concentrat-
ing on the documents with high confidence val-
ues, TLA manages to remedy this problem to an
extent. While misclassifications are still present,
recalls for the Fiction and Non-Fiction genres are
increased significantly, which explains the higher
overall accuracy.
6 Conclusion and future work
I have presented the first work on cross-lingual
genre classification (CLGC). I have shown that
some text features can be considered stable genre
predictors across languages and that it is possi-
ble to achieve good results in CLGC tasks without

resource-intensive MT techniques. My approach
exploits stable features to bridge the language gap
and subsequently applies iterative target language
adaptation (TLA) in order to improve accuracy.
The approach performed equally well or better
than full text translation combined with mono-
lingual classification. Considering that English
and Chinese are very dissimilar linguistically, I
expect the approach to work at least equally well
for more closely related language pairs.
This work is still in progress. While my results
are encouraging, more work is needed to make
the CLGC approach more robust. At the moment,
classification accuracy is low for problems with
many classes. I plan to remedy this by implement-
ing a hierarchical classification framework, where
a text is assigned a broad genre label first and then
classified further within this category.
Since TLA can only work on a sufficiently
good initial labeling of target language texts, sta-
ble feature classification results have to be im-
proved as well. To this end, I propose to focus
initially on features involving punctuation. This
could include analyses of the different punctu-
ation symbols used in comparison with the rest
of the document set, their frequencies and devia-
tions between sentences, punctuation n-gram pat-
terns, as well as the analyses of the positions of
punctuation symbols within sentences or whole
texts. Punctuation has frequently been used in
genre classification tasks and it is expected that
some of the features based on such symbols are
valuable in a cross-lingual setting as well. As vo-
cabulary richness seems to be a useful predictor of
genres, experiments will also be extended beyond
the simple inclusion of type/token ratios in the
feature set. For example, hapax legomena statis-
tics could be used, as well as the conformance to
text laws, such as Zipf, Benford, and Heaps.
After this, I will examine text structure a pre-
dictor. While single line statistics and topic AP
scores already reflect text structure, more sophis-
ticated pre-processing methods, such as text seg-
mentation and unsupervised PoS induction, might
yield better results. The experiments using the
tf-idf values of terms will be extended. Result-
ing features may include the positions of highly
weighted words in a text, the amount of topics
covered, or identification of summaries.
TLA techniques can also be refined. An obvi-
ous choice is to consider different types of fea-
tures, as mentioned in Section 3.3. Different rep-
resentations may even be combined to capture the
notion of different communicative purpose, sim-
ilar to the multi-dimensional approach by Biber
(1995). An interesting idea to combine differ-
ent sets of features was suggested by Chaker and
Habib (2007). Assigning a document to all genres
with different probabilities and repeating this for
different sets of features may yield a very flexi-
ble classifier. The impact of the feature sets on
the final prediction could be weighted according
to different criteria, such as prediction certainty
or overlap with other feature sets. Improvements
may also be achieved by choosing a more reliable
method for finding the most confident genre pre-
dictions as a function of the distance to the SVM
decision boundary. Cross-validation techniques
will be explored to estimate confidence values.
Finally, I will have to test the approach on a
larger set of data with texts from more languages.
To this end, I am working to compile a reference
corpus for CLGC by combining publicly available
sources. This would be useful to compare meth-
ods and will hopefully encourage further research.
