Abstract
Many current sentence generators lack
the ability to compute elliptical versions
of coordinated clauses in accordance with
the rules for Gapping, Forward and
Backward Conjunction Reduction, and
SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Fi-
nite/Fronted verb). We describe a module
(implemented in JAVA, with German
and Dutch as target languages) that takes
non-elliptical coordinated clauses as in-
put and returns all reduced versions li-
censed by coordinative ellipsis. It is
loosely based on a new psycholinguistic
theory of coordinative ellipsis proposed
by Kempen. In this theory, coordinative
ellipsis is not supposed to result from the
application of declarative grammar rules
for clause formation but from a proce-
dural component that interacts with the
sentence generator and may block the
overt expression of certain constituents.
1 Introduction
Coordination and coordinative ellipsis are essen-
tial tools for the sentence aggregation component
of any language generator. Very often, when the
aggregator chooses to combine several clauses
into a single coordinate structure, the need arises
to eliminate unnatural reduplications of corefer-
ential constituents.
In the literature, one often distinguishes four
major types of clause-level coordinative ellipsis:
• Gapping (as in (1)), with a special variant
called Long-Distance Gapping (LDG). In
LDG, the second conjunct consists of con-
stituents stemming from different clauses —
in (2), the main clause and the complement.
• Forward Conjunction Reduction (FCR; cf. (3)
and the relative clause in (4)).
• SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/
Fronted verb; as in (5), and
• Backward Conjunction reduction (BCR, also
termed Right Node Raising; see (6)).

The subscripts denote the elliptical mechanism at
work: g=Gapping, gl=LDG, f=FCR, s=SGF,
b=BCR. We will not deal with VP Ellipsis and
VP Anaphora because they generate pro-forms
rather than elisions and are not restricted to coor-
dination (cf. the title of the paper).
In current sentence generators, the coordina-
tive ellipsis rules are often inextricably inter-
twined with the rules for generating non-
elliptical coordinate structures, so that they can-
not easily be ported to other grammar formalisms
— e.g., Sarkar & Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoin-
ing Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; Bateman, Matthiessen &
Zeng (1999) for Functional Grammar. Genera-
tors that do include an autonomous component
for coordinative ellipsis (Dalianis, 1999; Shaw,
2002; Hielkema, 2005), use incomplete rule sets,
thus risking over- or undergeneration, and incor-
rect or unnatural output.
The module (dubbed ELLEIPO, from Greek
?????pi? ‘I leave out’) we present here, is less
115
formalism-dependent and, in principle, less liable
to over- or undergeneration than its competitors.
In Section 2, we sketch the theoretical back-
ground. Section 3 and the Appendix describe our
implementation, with examples from German.
Finally, in Section 4, we discuss the prospects of
extending the module to additional constructions.
2 Some theoretical background
ELLEIPO is loosely based on Kempen’s
(subm.) psycholinguistically motivated syntactic
theory of clausal coordination and coordinative
ellipsis. It departs from the assumption that the
generator’s strategic (conceptual, pragmatic)
component is responsible for selecting the con-
cepts and conceptual structures that enable iden-
tification of discourse referents (except in case of
syntactically conditioned pronominalization).
The strategic component may conjoin two or
more clauses into a coordination and deliver as
output a non-reduced sequence of conjuncts.1
The concepts in these conjuncts are adorned with
reference tags, and identical tags express
coreferentiality.2
Structures of this kind serve as input to the
(syn)tactical component of the generator, where
they are grammatically encoded (lexicalized and
given syntactic form) without any form of coor-
dinative ellipsis. The resulting non-elliptical
structures are input to ELLEIPO, which computes
and executes options for coordinative ellipsis.
ELLEIPO’s functioning is based on the as-
sumption that coordinative ellipsis does not re-
sult from the application of declarative grammar
rules for clause formation but from a procedural
component that interacts with the sentence gen-
erator and may block the overt expression of cer-
tain constituents. Due to this feature, ELLEIPO
can be combined, at least in principle, with vari-
ous grammar formalisms. However, this advan-
tage is not entirely gratis: The module needs a
formalism-dependent interface that converts gen-
1The strategic component is also supposed to apply rules of
logical inference yielding the conceptual structures that
underlie “respectively coordinations.” Hence, the conver-
sion of clausal into NP coordination (such as Anne likes
biking and Susi likes skating into Anne and Susi like bik-
ing and skating, respectively is supposed to arise in the
strategic, not the (syn)tactical component of the generator.
This also applies to simpler cases without respectively,
such as John is skating and Peter is skating versus John
and Peter are skating. The module presented here does
not handle these conversions (see Reiter & Dale (2000,
pp. 133-139) for examples and possible solutions.)

tween “strict” and “sloppy” (token- vs. type-)identity.
erator output to a (simple) canonical form.
3 A sketch of the algorithm
This sketch presupposes and-coordinations of
only n=2 conjuncts. Actually, ELLEIPO handles
and-coordinations with n!2 conjuncts if, in every
pair of conjuncts, the major constituents embody
the same pattern of coreferences and contrasts.
ELLEIPO takes as input a non-elliptical syntac-
tic structure that should meet the following four
canonical form criteria (see Fig. 1 for the input
tree corresponding to example (7).
(7) Susi hörte dass Hans einen Unfall hatte
Susi heard that Hans an accident had
und dassf Hansf sterben könnte
and that Hans die might
‘Susi heard that Hans had an accident and
might die’
• Categorial (phrasal and lexical) nodes —
bolded in Fig. 1 — carry reference tags (pre-
sumably propagated from the generator’s strate-
gic component). E.g., the tag “7” is attached to
the root and head nodes of both exemplars of NP
Hans in Fig. 1, indicating their coreferentiality.
For the sake of computational uniformity, we
also attach reference tags to non-referring lexical
elements. In such cases, the tags denote lexical
instead of referential identity. For instance, the
fact that the two tokens of subordinating con-
junction dass ‘that’ in Fig. 1 carry the same tag,
is interpreted by ELLEIPO as indicating lexical
identity. In combination with other properties,
this licenses elision of the second dass (see (7)).
• The conjuncts are sister nodes separated by
coordinating conjunctions; we call these configu-
rations coordination domains. The order of the
conjuncts and their constituents is defined.
• Every categorial node of the input tree is im-
mediately dominated by a functional node.
• Each clausal conjunct is rooted in an S-node
whose daughter nodes (immediate constituents)
are grammatical functions. Within a clausal con-
junct, all functions are represented at the same
hierarchical level. Hence, the trees are “flat,” as
illustrated in Fig. 1, and similar to the trees in
German treebanks (NEGRA-II, TIGER).
ELLEIPO starts by demarcating “superclauses.”
Kempen (subm.) introduced this notion in his
treatment of Gapping and LDG. An S-node domi-
nates a superclause iff it dominates the entire
sentence or a clause beginning with a sub-
ordinating conjunction (CNJ). In Fig. 1, the
strings dominated by S1, S5 and S12 are super-

clauses. Note that S12 includes clause S13, which
is not a superclause.
Then, ELLEIPO checks all coordination do-
mains for elision options, as follows:
• Testing for forward ellipsis: Gapping (includ-
ing LDG), FCR, or SGF. This involves inspect-
ing (recursively for every S-node) the set of im-
mediate constituents (grammatical functions) of
the two conjuncts, and their reference tags.
Complete constituents of the right-hand conjunct
may get marked for elision, depending on the
specific conditions listed in the Appendix.
• Testing for BCR. ELLEIPO checks — word-
by-word, going from right to left — the corefer-
ence tags of the conjuncts. As a result, complete
or partial constituents in the right-hand periphery
of the left conjunct may get marked for elision.
The final step of the module is ReadOut. Af-
ter all coordination domains have been proc-
essed, a (possibly empty) subset of the terminal
leaves of the input tree has been marked for eli-
sion. In the examples below, this is indicated by
subscript marks. E.g., the subscript “g” attached
to esst ‘eat’ in (9b) indicates that Gapping is al-
lowed. ReadOut interprets the elision marks and,
in ‘standard mode,’ produces the shortest ellipti-
cal string(s) as output (e.g. (9c)). In ‘demo
mode,’ it shows individual and combined ellipti-
cal options on user request. Furthermore, auch
‘too’ is added in case of “Stripping,” i.e. when
Gapping leaves only one constituent as remnant.
Example (10) illustrates a combination of
Gapping and BCR, with the three licensed ellip-
tical output strings shown in (10c). In (11), Gap-
ping combines with BCR in the subordinate
clauses. The fact that here, in contrast with (10),
the subordinate clauses do not start their own
superclauses, now licenses LDG. However,
ReadOut prevents LDG to combine with BCR,
which would have yielded the unintended string

4 Conclusion
Currently, ELLEIPO can handle all major types of
clausal coordinative ellipsis in German and
Dutch. However, further finetuning of the rules
is needed, e.g., in order to take subtle semantic
conditions on SGF and Gapping into account.
We expect further improvements by allowing for
interactions between the ellipsis module and the
generator’s pronominalization strategy. Work on
porting ELLEIPO to related languages, in particu-
lar English, and to coordinations of non-clausal
constituents (NP, PP, AP) is in progress.
