Levinson's book presents a theory of generalized conversational implicature (GCI), and 
makes the central claim that this theory necessitates a "new view of the architecture of 
the theory of meaning" (p. 9). Levinson claims that to account for GCI (and other types 
of presumptive meanings, or preferred interpretations), it is necessary to distinguish 
a new level of utterance-type meaning from sentence-meaning and speaker-meaning: 
"This level is to capture the suggestions that the use of an expression of a certain type 
generally or normally carries, by default" (p. 71). The book belongs to the genre of 
linguistic argumentation. Expanding upon the Gricean notion of GCI (Grice 1975), the 
author provides numerous examples of GCI and classifies them into three categories, 
each category representing a different licensing heuristic. Then he discusses the im- 
plications of the theory: first, for the interface between semantics and pragmatics, and 
second, for syntactic theory. Throughout the presentation, the author addresses in great 
detail potential objections and counterarguments from alternative theories of meaning. 
According to the author, GCIs are defeasible inferences triggered by the speaker's 
choice of utterance form and lexical items because of three heuristics mutually assumed 
by speaker and hearer. The heuristics, which can be related to Grice's maxims, are 
these: 
• The First (Q) Heuristic: "What isn't said, isn't." For example, in the 
context of a blocks world where there are salient oppositions of objects 
{cones, pyramids, cubes} and colors {red, blue}, from the assertion 
"There's a blue pyramid on the red cube", this heuristic triggers the 
following inferences: 'There is not a cone on the red cube'; 'There is not a 
red pyramid on the red cube' (p. 31). 
• The Second (I) Heuristic: "What is simply described is stereotypically 
exemplified." For example, from the assertion "The blue pyramid is on 
the red cube," in the context described above one is licensed to infer 
'The pyramid is a stereotypical one ... ," 'The pyramid is directly 
supported by the cube ... ,' etc. (p. 32). 
• The Third (M) Heuristic: "What's said in an abnormal way, isn't normal; 
or Marked message indicates marked situation." For example, from the 
assertion "The blue cuboid block is supported by the red cube," in the 
context described above one is licensed to infer 'The blue block is not, 
strictly, a cube,' The blue block is not directly or centrally or stably 
supported by the red cube,' etc. (p. 33).

In addition, the theory provides arefinement toGazdar's (1979) projection mechanism; 
GCIs licensed by Heuristic 1 are preferred to those licensed by Heuristic 3, which in 
turn are preferred to those licensed by Heuristic 2. 
The book argues against he traditional view of the roles of semantics and prag- 
matics, according to which the output of semantics i the input to pragmatics. Instead, 
it argues for a more complex relationship in which GCI can play a role in truth condi- 
tions. In this model, two distinct ypes of semantic processes and two distinct ypes of 
pragmatic processes are involved. First, the semantic representation derived from the 
syntactic structure and lexical items of a sentence may be underspecified. The output 
of this semantic process is the input to a pragmatic process ("Gricean pragmatics l"), 
in which default, defeasible pragmatic inferences such as GCIs may contribute to de- 
termining the proposition expressed, for example, by helping to disambiguate l xical 
ambiguity, "generality narrowing" (i.e., narrowing word sense), and determining ref- 
erence. The output of this process is the input to model-theoretic semantics. After 
sentence meaning has been determined by this semantic process, another pragmatic 
process ("Gricean pragmatics II') is responsible for deriving other inferences such as 
particularized conversational implicatures; this final process yields speaker meaning. 
Certainly, the debate on the role of pragmatics in the linguistic "architecture" is 
of significance to computational linguistics. In addition, the book provides a wealth 
of descriptive information on GCI as well as many pointers to related work in theo- 
retical inguistics. However, unfortunately, the book lacks a computational or formal 
orientation. For example, much theoretical work would remain to build a computa- 
tional model of GCI based just upon the information presented in the book. Also, its 
coverage of potentially relevant work in computational linguistics is not up to date; 
for example, there is no discussion of recent lexical-pragmatics-oriented approaches 
such as those of Di Eugenio and Webber (1996), Elhadad, McKeown, and Robin (1997), 
and Stone and Webber (1998). Despite these limitations, this book will be of interest 
to language researchers, computationally-oriented or not, with an interest in theories 
of meaning.
