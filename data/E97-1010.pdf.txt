This paper discusses research on distin- 
guishing word meanings in the context of 
information retrieval systems. We conduc- 
ted experiments with three sources of evid- 
ence for making these distinctions: mor- 
phology, part-of-speech, and phrases. We 
have focused on the distinction between 
homonymy and polysemy (unrelated vs. re- 
lated meanings). Our results support the 
need to distinguish homonymy and poly-  
semy. We found: 1) grouping morpholo- 
gical variants makes a significant improve- 
ment in retrieval performance, 2) that more 
than half of all words in a dictionary that 
differ in part-of-speech are related in mean- 
ing, and 3) that it is crucial to assign credit 
to the component words of a phrase. These 
experiments provide a better understanding 
of word-based methods, and suggest where 
natural language processing can provide 
further improvements in retrieval perform- 
ance. 
1 Introduction 
Lexical ambiguity is a fundamental problem in nat- 
ural language processing, but relatively little quant- 
itative information is available about the extent of 
the problem, or about the impact that it has on spe- 
cific applications. We report on our experiments to 
resolve lexical ambiguity in the context of informa- 
tion retrieval (IR). Our approach to disambiguation 
is to treat the information associated with dictionary

versity of Massachusetts. It was supported by the Na-

senses (morphology. part of speech, and phrases) as 
multiple sources of evidence. 1 Experiments were de- 
signed to test each source of evidence independently, 
and to identify areas of interaction. Our hypothesis 
is: 
Hypothes is  1 Resolving lexical ambiguity will lead 
to an improvement in retrieval performance. 
There are many issues involved in determining 
how word senses should be used in information re- 
trieval. The most basic issue is one of identity - -  
what is a word sense? In previous work, research- 
ers have usually made distinctions based on their 
intuition. This is not satisfactory for two reasons. 
First, it is difficult to scale up; researchers have gen- 
erally focused on only two or three words. Second, 
they have used very coarse grained distinctions (e.g., 
'river bank' v. 'commercial bank'). In practice it is 
often difficult to determine how many senses a word 
should have, and meanings are often related (Kilgar- 
rift 91). 
A related issue is sense granularity. Dictionar- 
ies often make very fine distinctions between word 
meanings, and it isn't clear whether these distinc- 
tions are important in the context of a particular 
application. For example, the sentence They danced 
across the lvom is ambiguous with respect to the 
word dance. It can be paraphrased as They were 
across the room and they were dancing, or as They 
crossed the tvom as they danced. The sentence is 
not. ambiguous in Romance languages, and can only 
have the former meaning. Machine translation sys- 
t.ems therefore need to be aware of this ambiguity and 
translate the sentence appropriately. This is a sys- 
tematic class of ambiguity, and applies to all "verbs 
of translatory motion" (e.g., The bottle floated ~mder 
the bridge will exhibit the same distinction (Talmy 
85)). Such distinctions are unlikely to have an im- 
pact on information retrieval. However, there are 
1We used the Longman Dictionary as our source of 
information about word senses (Procter 78). 
"/2 
also distinctions that are important in information 
retrieval that are unlikely to be important in ma- 
chine translation. For example, the word west can 
be used in the context the East versus the West, or in 
the context West Germany. These two senses were 
found to provide a good separation between relevant 
and non-relevant documents, but the distinction is 
probably not important for machine translation. It 
is likely that different applications will require differ- 
ent types of distinctions, and the type of distinctions 
required in information retrieval is an open question. 
Finally, there are questions about how word senses 
should be used in a retrieval system. In general, 
word senses should be used to supplement word- 
based indexing rather than indexing on word senses 
alone. This is because of the uncertainty involved 
with sense representation, and the degree to which 
we can identify a particular sense with the use of a 
word in context. If we replace words with senses, we 
are making an assertion that we are very certain that 
the replacement does not lose any of the information 
important in making relevance judgments, and that 
the sense we are choosing for a word is in fact cor- 
rect. Both of these are problematic. Until more is 
learned about sense distinctions, and until very ac- 
curate methods are developed for identifying senses, 
it is probably best to adopt a more conservative ap- 
proach (i.e., uses senses as a supplement to word- 
based indexing). 
The following section will provide an overview of 
lexical ambiguity and information retrieval. This 
will be followed by a discussion of our experiments. 
The paper will conclude with a summary of what has 
been accomplished, and what work remains for the 
future. 
2 Lex ica l  Ambigu i ty  and  
In fo rmat ion  Ret r ieva l  
2.1 Background 
Many retrieval systems represent documents and 
queries by the words they contain. There are two 
problems with using words to represent he content 
of documents. The first problem is that words are 
ambiguous, and this ambiguity can cause documents 
to be retrieved that are not relevant. Consider the 
following description of a search that was performed 
using the keyword "AIDS': 
Unfortunately, not all 34 \[references\] were 
about AIDS, the disease. The references 
included "two helpful aids during the first 
three months after total hip replacemenC, 
and "aids in diagnosing abnormal voiding 
patterns". (Helm 83) 
One response to this problem is to use phrases 
to reduce ambiguity (e.g., specifying "hearing aids" 
if that is the desired sense). It is not always pos- 
sible, however, to provide phrases in which the word 
occurs only with the desired sense. In addition, the 
requirement for phrases imposes a significant burden 
on the user. 
The second problem is that a document can be 
relevant even though it does not use the same words 
as those that are provided in the query. The user 
is generally not interested in retrieving documents 
with exactly the same words, but with the concepts 
that those words represent. Retrieval systems ad- 
dress this problem by expanding the query words us- 
ing related words from a thesaurus (Salton and Mc- 
Gill 83). The relationships described in a thesaurus, 
however, are really between word senses rather than 
words. For example, the word "term" could be syn- 
onymous with 'word' (as in a vocabulary term), "sen- 
tence' (as in a prison term), or "condition' (as in 
'terms of agreement'). If we expand the query with 
words from a thesaurus, we must be careful to use 
the right senses of those words. We not only have 
to know the sense of the word in the query (in this 
example, the sense of the word "term'), but the sense 
of the word that is being used to augment it (e.g., the 
appropriate sense of the word 'sentence') (Chodorow 
et al 88). 
2.2 Types  o f  Lexlcal  Ambigu i ty  
Lexical ambiguity can be divided into homonymy 
and polysemy, depending on whether or not the 
meanings are related. The bark of a dog versus the 
bark of a tree is an example of homonymy; review as 
a noun and as a verb is an example of polysemy. 
The distinction between homonymy and polysemy 
is central. Homonymy is important because it sep- 
arates unrelated concepts. If we have a query about 
"AIDS' (tile disease), and a document contains "aids" 
in the sense of a hearing aid, then the word aids 
should not contribute to our belief that the docu- 
ment is relevant o the query. Polysemy is important 
because the related senses constitute a partial repres- 
entation of the overall concept. If we fail to group 
related senses, it is as if we are ignoring some of the 
occurrences of a query word in a document. So for 
example, if we are distinguishing words by part-of- 
speech, and the query contains 'diabetic' as a noun, 
the retrieval system will exclude instances in which 
'diabetic' occurs as an adjective unless we recognize 
that the noun and adjective senses for that word are 
related and group them together. 
Although there is a theoretical distinction between 
homonymy and polysemy, it is not always easy to tell 
73  
them apart in practice. What determines whether 
the senses are related? Dictionaries group senses 
based on part-of-speech and etymology, but as illus- 
trated by the word review, senses can be related even 
though they differ in syntactic ategory. Senses may 
also be related etymologically, but be perceived as 
distinct at the present ime (e.g., the "cardinal' of a 
church and "cardinal' numbers are etymologically re- 
lated). We investigated several methods to identify 
related senses both across part of speech and within 
a single homograph, and these will be described in 
more detail in Section 3.2.1. 
3 Exper iments  on  Word-Sense  
D isambiguat ion  
3.1 P re l iminary  Exper iments  
Our initial experiments were designed to investigate 
the following two hypotheses: 
Hypothes is  2 Word senses provide an effective 
separation between relevant and non-relevant docu- 
ments. 
As we saw earlier in the paper, it is possible for 
a query about 'AIDS' the disease to retrieve docu- 
ments about 'hearing aids'. But to what extent are 
such inappropriate matches associated with relevance 
judgments? This hypothesis predicts that sense mis- 
matches will be more likely to appear in documents 
that are not relevant han in those that are relevant. 
Hypothes is  3 Even a small domain-specific collec- 
tion of documents exhibits a significant degree of lex- 
ical ambiguity. 
Little quantitative data is available about lexical 
ambiguity, and such data as is available is often con- 
fined to only a small number of words. In addition, 
it is generally assumed that lexical ambiguity does 
not occur very often in domain-specific text. This 
hypothesis was tested by quantifying the ambiguity 
for a large number of words in such a collection, and 
challenging the assumption that ambiguity does not 
occur very often. 
To investigate these hypotheses we conducted ex- 
periments with two standard test collections, one 
consisting of titles and abstracts in Computer Sci- 
ence, and the other consisting of short articles from 
Time magazine. 
The first experiment was concerned with determ- 
ining how often sense mismatches occur between 
a query and a document, and whether these mis- 
matches indicate that the document is not relevant. 
To test this hypothesis we manually identified the 
senses of the words in the queries for two collec- 
tions (Computer Science and Time). These words 
were then manually checked against the words they 
matched in the top ten ranked documents for each 
query (the ranking was produced using a probabil- 
istic retrieval system). The number of sense mis- 
matches was then computed, and the mismatches in
the relevant documents were identified. 
The second experiment involved quantifying the 
degree of ambiguity found in the test collections. We 
manually examined the word tokens in the corpus for 
each query word, and estimated the distribution of 
the senses. The number of word types with more 
than one meaning was determined. Because of the 
volume of data analysis, only one collection was ex- 
amined (Computer Science), and the distribution of 
senses was only coarsely estimated; there were ap- 
proximately 300 unique query words, and they con- 
stituted 35,000 tokens in the corpus. 
These experiments provided strong support for 
Hypotheses 2 and 3. Word meanings are highly cor- 
related with relevance judgements, and the corpus 
study showed that there is a high degree of lexical 
ambiguity even in a small collection of scientific text 
(over 40% of the query words were found to be am- 
biguous in the corpus). These experiments provided 
a clear indication of the potential of word mean- 
ings to improve the performance of a retrieval sys- 
tem. The experiments are described in more detail 
in (Krovetz and Croft 92). 
3.2 Exper iments  with di f ferent sources of 
ev idence 
The next set of experiments were concerned with 
determining the effectiveness of different sources 
of evidence for distinguishing word senses. We 
were also interested in the extent with which a 
difference in form corresponded to a difference in 
meaning. For example, words can differ in mor- 
phology (authorize/authorized), or part-of-speech 
(diabetic \[noun\]/diabetic \[adj\]), or in their abil- 
ity to appear in a phrase (database/data base). 
They can also exhibit such differences, but rep- 
resent different concepts, such as author/authorize. 
sink\[noun\]/sink\[verb\], o  stone wall/stonewall. Our 
default assumption was that a difference in form is 
associated with a difference in meaning unless we 
could establish that the different word forms were 
related. 
3.2.1 L ink ing re la ted  word mean ings  
We investigated two approaches for relating senses 
with respect to morphology and part of speech: 1) 
exploiting the presence of a variant of a term within 
its dictionary definition, and 2) using the overlap of 
the words in the definitions of suspected variants. 
74 
For example, liable appears within the definition of 
liability, and this is used as evidence that those words 
are related. Similarly, flat as a noun is defined as "a 
flat tire', and the presence of the word in its own 
definition, but with a different part of speech, is 
taken as evidence that the noun and adjective mean- 
ings are related. We can also compute the overlap 
between the definitions of liable and liability, and 
if they have a significant number of words in com- 
mon then that is evidence that those meanings are 
related. These two strategies could potentially be 
used for phrases as well, but phrases are one of the 
areas where dictionaries are incomplete, and other 
methods are needed for determining when phrases 
are related. We will discuss this in Section 3.2.4. 
We conducted experiments to determine the effect- 
iveness of the two methods for linking word senses. 
In the first experiment we investigated the perform- 
ance of a part-of-speech tagger for identifying the 
related forms. These related forms (e.g., fiat as a 
noun and an adjective) are referred to as instances of 
zero-affix morphology, or functional shift (Marchand 
63). We first tagged all definitions in the dictionary 
for words that began with the letter 'W'.  This pro- 
duced a list of 209 words that appeared in their own 
definitions with a different part of speech. However, 
we found that only 51 (24%) were actual cases of 
related meanings. This low success rate was almost 
entirely due to tagging error. That is, we had a false 
positive rate of 76% because the tagger indicated the 
wrong part of speech. We conducted a failure ana- 
lysis and it indicated that 91% the errors occurred in 
idiomatic expressions (45 instances) or example sen- 
tences associated with the definitions (98 instances). 
We therefore omitted idiomatic senses and example 
sentences from further processing and tagged the 
rest of the dictionary. 2 
The result of this experiment is that the dictionary 
contains at least 1726 senses in which the headword 
was mentioned, but with a different part of speech, 
of which 1566 were in fact related (90.7%). We ana- 
lyzed the distribution of the connections, and this is 
given in Table 1 (n = 1566). 
However, Table 1 does not include cases in which 
the word appears in its definition, but in an inflected 
form. For example, 'cook' as a noun is defined as 
'a person who prepares and cooks food'. Unless we 
recognize the inflected form, we will not capture all of 
the instances. We therefore repeated the procedure, 
but allowing for inflectional variants. The result is 
given in Table 2 (n = 1054). 
We also conducted an experiment o determine

codes. 
the effectiveness of capturing related senses via word 
overlap. The result is that if the definitions for the 
root and variant had two or more words in common ,3 
93% of the pairs were semantically related. However, 
of the sense-pairs that were actually related, two- 
thirds had only one word in common. We found 
that 65% of the sense-pairs with one word in com- 
mon were related. Having only one word in common 
between senses is very weak evidence that the senses 
are related, and it is not surprising that there is a 
greater degree of error. 
Tile two experiments, tagging and word overlap, 
were found to be to be highly effective once the com- 
mon causes of error were removed. In the case of 
tagging the error was due to idiomatic senses and ex- 
ample sentences, and in the case of word overlap the 
error was links due to a single word in common. Both 
methods have approximately a 90% success rate in 
pairing the senses of morphological variants if those 
problems are removed. The next section will discuss 
our experiments with morphology. 
3.2.2 Exper iments  wi th  Morpho logy  
We conducted several experiments to determine 
the impact of grouping morphological variants on 
retrieval performance. These experiments are de- 
scribed in detail in (Krovetz 93), so we will only 
summarize them here. 
Our experiments compared a baseline (no stem- 
ming) against several different morphology routines: 
1) a routine that grouped only inflectional variants 
(plurals and tensed verb forms), 2) a routine that 
grouped inflectional as well as derivational variants 
(e.g.,- ize,- ity),  and 3) the Porter stemmer (Porter 
80). These experiments were done with four different 
test collections which varied in both size and subject 
area. We found that there was a significant improve- 
ment over the baseline performance from grouping 
morphological variants. 
Earlier experiments with morphology in IR did not 
report improvements in performance (Harman 91). 
We attribute these differences to the use of different 
test collections, and in part to the use of different 
retrieval systems. We found that the improvement 
varies depending on the test collection, and that col- 
lections that were made up of shorter documents were 
more likely to improve. This is because morpholo- 
gical variants can occur within the same document, 
but they are less likely to do so in documents that 
are short. By grouping morphological variants, we 
are helping to improve access to the shorter docu- 
ments. However, we also found improvements even 
aExcluding closed class words, such as of and for. 
75 
in a collection of legal documents which had an av- 
erage length of more than 3000 words. 
We also found it was very difficult to improve 
retrieval performance over the performance of the 
Porter stemmer, which does not use a lexicon. The 
absence of a lexicon causes the Porter stemmer 
to make errors by grouping morphological "false 
friends" (e.g.. author/authority, or police/policy). 
We found that there were three reasons why the 
Porter stemmer improves performance despite such 
groupings. The first two reasons are associated with 
the heuristics used by the stemmer: 1) some word 
forms will be grouped when one of the forms has 
a combination of endings (e.g., -ization and -ize). 
We empirically found that the word forms in these 
groups are almost always related in meaning. 2) the 
stemmer uses a constraint on the form of the res- 
ulting stem based on a sequence of consonants and 
vowels; we found that this constraint is surprisingly 
effective at separating unrelated variants. The third 
reason has to do with the nature of morphological 
variants. We found that when a word form appears 
to be a variant, it often is a variant. For example, 
consider the grouping of police and policy. We ex- 
amined all words in the dictionary in which a word 
ended in 'y', and in which the 'y' could be replaced 
by 'e' and still yield a word in the dictionary. There 
were 175 such words, but only 39 were clearly un- 
related in meaning to the presumed root (i.e., cases 
like policy/police). Of the 39 unrelated word pairs, 
only 14 were grouped by the Porter stemmer because 
of the consonant/vowel constraints. We also identi- 
fied the morphological "'false friends" for the 10 most 
frequent suffixes. We found that out of 911 incorrect 
word pairs, only 303 were grouped by the Porter 
stemmer. 
Finally, we found that conflating inflectional vari- 
ants harmed the performance of about a third of 
the queries. This is partially a result of the inter- 
action between morphology and part-of-speech (e.g., 
a query that contains work in the sense of theoretical 
work will be grouped with all of the variants asso- 
ciated with the the verb- worked, working, works); 
we note that some instances of works can be related 
to the singular form work (although not necessarily 
the right meaning of work), and some can be related 
to the untensed verb form. Grouping inflectional 
variants also harms retrieval performance because 
of an overlap between inflected forms and uninflec- 
ted forms (e.g., arms can occur as a reference to 
weapons, or as an inflected form of arm). Conflat- 
ing these forms has the effect of grouping unrelated 
concepts, and thus increases the net ambiguity. 
Our experiments with morphology support our at- 
gument about distinguishing homonymy and poly- 
semy. Grouping related morphological variants 
makes a significant improvement in retrieval per- 
formance. Morphological false friends (policy/police) 
often provide a strong separation between relevant 
and non-relevant documents ( ee (Krovetz and Croft 
92)). There are no morphology routines that can 
currently handle the problems we encountered with 
inflectional variants, and it is likely that separating 
related from unrelated forms will make further im- 
provements in performance. 
3.2.3 Exper iments  with Par t  of  Speech 
Relatively little attention has been paid in IR to 
the differences in a word's part of speech. These 
differences have been used to help identify phrases 
(Dillon and Gray 83), and as a means of filtering 
for word sense disambiguation (to only consider the 
meanings of nouns (Voorhees 93)). To the best of our 
knowledge the differences have never been examined 
for distinguishing meanings within the context of IR. 
The aim of our experiments was to determine how 
well part of speech differences correlate with differ- 
ences in word meanings, and to what extent the use 
of meanings determined by these differences will af- 
fect the performance of a retrieval system. We con- 
ducted two sets of experiments, one concerned with 
homonymy, and one concerned with polysemy. In 
the first experiment the Church tagger was used to 
identify part-of-speech of the words in documents 
and queries. The collections were then indexed by 
the word tagged with the part of speech (i.e., in- 
stead of indexing 'book', we indexed 'book/noun' 
and 'book/verb'). 4 A baseline was established in 
which all variants of a word were present in the 
query, regardless of part of speech variation; the 
baseline did not include any morphological variants 
of the query words because we wanted to test the in- 
teraction between morphology and part-of-speech in 
a separate xperiment. The baseline was then com- 
pared against a version of the query in which all vari- 
ations were eliminated except for the part of speech 
that was correct (i.e., if the word was used as a noun 
ill the original query, all other variants were elimin- 
ated). This constituted the experiment that tested 
homonymy. We then identified words that were re- 
lated in spite of a difference in part of speech; this 
was based on the data that was produced by tagging 
the dictionary (see Section 3.2.1). Another version of 
the queries was constructed in which part of speech 
variants were retained if the meaning was related, 
4in actuality, we indexed it with whatever tags were 
used by the tagger; we are just using 'noun' and 'verb' 
for purposes of illustration. 
76 
and this was compared to the previous version. 
When we ran the experiments, we found that 
performance decreased compared with the baseline. 
However, we found many cases where the tagger was 
incorrect. 5 We were unable to determine whether 
the results of the experiment were due to the incor- 
rectness of the hypothesis being tested (that distinc- 
tions in part of speech can lead to an improvement 
in performance), or to the errors made by the tagger. 
We also assumed that a difference in part-of-speech 
would correspond to a difference in meaning. The 
data in Table 1 and Table 2 shows that many words 
are related in meaning despite a difference in part- 
of-speech. Not all errors made by the tagger cause 
decreases in retrieval performance, and we are in the 
process of determining the error rate of the tagger on 
those words in which part-of-speech differences are 
also associated with a difference in concepts (e.g., 
novel as a noun and as an adjective). 6 
3.2.4 Experiments with Phrases 
Phrases are an important and poorly understood 
area of IR. They generally improve retrieval perform- 
ance, but the improvements are not consistent. Most 
research to date has focused on syntactic phrases, 
in which words are grouped together because they 
are in a specific syntactic relationship (Fagan 87), 
(Smeaton and Van Rijsbergen 88). The research 
in this section is concerned with a subset of these 
phrases, namely those that are lexical. A lexical 
phrase is a phrase that might be defined in a dic- 
tionary, such as hot line or back end. Lexical phrases 
can be distinguished from a phrases such as sanc- 
tions against South Africa in that the meaning of a 
lexical phrase cannot necessarily be determined from 
the meaning of its parts. 
Lexical phrases are generally made up of only two 
or three words (overwhelmingly just two), and they 
usually occur in a fixed order. The literature men- 
tions examples uch as blind venetians vs. venetian 
blinds, or science library vs. library science, but 
these are primarily just cute examples. It is very 
rare that the order could be reversed to produce a 
different concept. 
Although dictionaries contain a large number of 
phrasal entries, there are many lexical phrases that 
are missing. These are typically proper nouns 
(United States, Great Britain, United Nations) or 
technical concepts (operating system, specific heat, 
5See (Krovetz 95) for more details about these errors. 
~There are approximately 4000 words in the Long- 
man dictionary which have more than one part-of-speech. 
Less than half of those words will be like novel, and we 
are examining them by hand. 
due process, strict liability). We manually identified 
the lexical phrases in four different test collections 
(the phrases were based on our judgement), and we 
found that 92 out of 120 phrases (77%) were not 
found in the Longman dictionary. A breakdown of 
the phrases is given in (h:rovetz 95). 
For the phrase experiment we not only had to 
identify the lexical phrases, we also had to identiL' 
any related forms, such as database~data b se. This 
was done via brute force - -  a program simply con- 
catenated every adjacent word in the database, and 
if it was also a single word in the collection it prim 
ted out the pair. We tested this with the Computer 
Science and Time collections, and used those results 
to develop an exception list for filtering the pairs 
(e.g., do not consider "special ties/specialties'). We 
represented the phrases using a proximity operator: 
and tried several experiments to include the related 
form when it was found in the corpus. 
We found that retrieval performance decreased for 
118 out of 120 phrases. A failure analysis indic- 
ated that this was due to the need to assign partial 
credit to individual words of a phrase. The com- 
ponent words were always related to the meaning of 
the compound as a whole (e.g., Britain and Great 
Britain). 
We also found that most of the instances of 
open/closed compounds (e.g., database~data b se) 
were related. Cases like "stone wall/stonewall' or 
'bottle neck/bottleneck' are infrequent. The effect oll 
performance of grouping the compounds i related to 
the relative distribution of the open and closed forms. 
Database~data b se occurred in about a 50/50 distri- 
bution, and the queries in which they occurred were 
significantly improved when the related form was in- 
cluded. 
3.2.5 In teract ions  between Sources  o f  
Ev idence  
We found many interactions between the different 
sources of evidence. The most striking is the inter- 
action between phrases and morphology. We found 
that the use of phrases acts as a filter for the group- 
ing of morphological variants. Errors in morphology 
generally do not hurt performance within the restric- 
ted context. For example, the Porter stemmer will 
reduce department to depart, but this has no effect 
in the context of the phrase 'Justice department'. 
~The proximity operator specifies that the query 
words must be adjacent and in order, or occur within 
a specific number of words of each other.

4 Conc lus ion  
Most of the research on lexical ambiguity has not 
been done in the context of an application. We 
have conducted experiments with hundreds of unique 
query words, and tens of thousands of word occur- 
rences. The research described in this paper is one of 
the largest studies ever done. We have examined the 
lexicon as a whole, and focused on the distinction 
between homonymy and polysemy. Other research 
on resolving lexical ambiguity for IR (e.g., (Sander- 
son 94) and (Voorhees 93)) does not take this dis- 
tinction into account. 
Our research supports the argument that it is im- 
portant o distinguish omonymy and polysemy. We 
have shown that natural language processing res- 
ults in an improvement in retrieval performance (via 
grouping related morphological variants), and our 
experiments suggest where further improvements can 
be made. We have also provided an explanation for 
the performance of the Porter stemmer, and shown 
it is surprisingly effective at distinguishing variant 
word forms that are unrelated in meaning. The ex- 
periment with part-of-speech tagging also high- 
lighted the importance of polysemy; more than half 
of all words in the dictionary that differ in part of 
speech are also related in meaning. Finally, our ex- 
periments with lexical phrases how that it is crucial 
to assign partial credit to the component words of 
a phrase. Our experiment with open/closed com- 
pounds indicated that these forms are almost always 
related in meaning. 
The experiment with part-of-speech tagging in- 
dicated that taggers make a number of errors, and 
our current work is concerned with identifying those 
words in which a difference in part of speech is as- 
sociated with a difference in meaning (e.g., train as 
a noun and as a verb). The words that exhibit such 
differences are likely to affect retrieval performance. 
We are also examining lexical phrases to decide how 
to assign partial credit to the component words. 
This work will give us a better idea of how language 
processing can provide further improvements in IR, 
and a better understanding of language in general.
