Abstract
This paper describes a study in which a
corpus of spoken Danish annotated with
focus and topic tags was used to inves-
tigate the relation between information
structure and pauses. The results show
that intra-clausal pauses in the focus do-
main, tend to precede those words that
express the property or semantic type
whereby the object in focus is distin-
guished from other ones in the domain.
1 Introduction
The interest for corpora annotated with infor-
mation structure has been raised recently by
several authors. Kruijff-Korbayova´ and Kruijff
(2004) describe a method where a rich discourse-
level annotation is used to investigate informa-
tion structure, while both Postolache (2005) and
Diderichsen and Elming (2005) study the appli-
cation of machine learning to the problem of au-
tomatic identification of topic and focus. In this
study, on the contrary, information structure is
annotated manually, and the annotation is used
to investigate the correlation between informa-
tion structure tags and intra-clausal pauses.
2 Annotating information structure
The starting point for this study was the corpus
of spoken Danish ‘DanPass’ (Grønnum, 2005),
a collection of 54 monologues produced by 18
different subjects dealing with three well-defined
tasks, following the methodology established in
Terken (1985). In the first task, the subjects de-
scribe a geometrical network, in the second the
process of assembling the drawing of a house
out of existing pieces, and in the third they solve
a map task. The corpus has been annotated
with several annotation tiers, including orthogra-
phy, phonetic transcription, pauses and PoS-tags.
Two independent annotators added then tags for
focus and topic based on a set of simple guide-
lines, and using the Praat tool to carry out the
annotation.
The annotation reflects the assumption that a
sentence can be divided into an obligatory fo-
cus part, which expresses the non-presupposed
information, and a presupposed background part.
A referent in the background part may function
as the sentence topic in the sense of Lambrecht
(1994). For each sentence in the corpus, the an-
notators were asked to identify what they intu-
itively considered non-presupposed information
and annotate it as belonging to the focus. Techni-
cally, each word belonging to the focus is added
a focus tag. The annotators were also asked to
test whether they could single out a sentence ref-
erent by means of the ”What about X” test (Rein-
hart, 1981). If they could, they were asked to add
topic tags to all the words making up the corre-
sponding expression. Words not bearing any tag
are considered part of the background.
The guidelines did not contain any reference
to pausing, nor did the annotators know that their
work would be used to study the correlation be-

Table 1: Tags in two corpus sections
tween pauses and information structure. In fact,
that was not the purpose of the annotation work,
which is of more general interest. It should also
be noted that the annotators were not explicitly
instructed to code phrases, since we did not want
to make the assumption that topic or focus nec-
essarily correspond to syntactic phrases. Ap-
proximately two person months were spent an-
notating two sections of the corpus. The kappa
score varied between 0.7 to 0.8 depending on
the corpus section, showing an acceptable inter-
annotator agreement. Most disagreements relate
to the identification of the focus left-hand bound-
ary, where one of the annotators sometimes iden-
tified wider focus domains than the other. These
differences have not been inspected yet, but will
be used to revise the guidelines to produce a
unique consistent annotation. Table (1) shows
the number of tags assigned by the two coders
(C1 and C2) in the two sections of the corpus
coded so far.
Below, an example of an annotated tier is
shown in a linearised format (the textgrids out-
put by Praat also contain time intervals that link
the transcription to the sound file):
(1) + ovenover + er der en/F + grøn/F cirkel/F
= og oven over den/T grønne/T cirkel/T er
der en/F + lilla/F trekant/F +
‘PAUSE above PAUSE there is [F a PAUSE
green circle] PAUSE and above [T the green
circle] there is [F a PAUSE purple triangle]’
The example consists of two sentences. In the
first, the annotator has tagged ‘en grøn cirkel’ (a
green circle) as the focus; in the second, ‘den
grønne cirkel’ (the green circle) has been tagged
as the topic, while ‘en lilla trekant’ (a purple tri-
angle) is tagged as the focus. Pauses are indi-
cated by ‘+’ and ‘=’. The former is a silent pause,
and the latter a pause accompanied by a sound,
like ‘hmm’. Pauses were already available in the
orthographic transcription of the corpus, which
was produced earlier by different annotators.
3 Pauses in earlier studies
The material annotated so far already gives us
the possibility to investigate whether there is a
significant relation between pauses and informa-
tion structure. Earlier studies (Jensen, 2005)
(Hansen et al., 1993) investigated the effect of
syntactic boundaries (clausal as well as phrasal)
on the placing of pauses in spoken Danish. In
the first study, it is found that more than 55%
of the pauses co-occur with clause boundaries,
12% with phrase boundaries, and the remain-
ing 33% occur within phrases or in conjunction
with repairs, interjections and enumerations. It
is also noted that pauses falling within a syntac-
tic phrase tend to be placed in the final part of
the sentence. The second study confirms this ob-
servation by showing that 60% of the pauses that
do not co-occur with syntactic boundaries occur
within the last 40% of the sentence (measured in
number of syllables). The authors of both inves-
tigations make the hypothesis that information
structure may have an effect on the occurrence
of pauses within clauses. However, the empiri-
cal material used in those works is not annotated
with respect to information structure, and there-
fore, no conclusive claim could be made. In ad-
dition, the data used in Hansen et al (1993) come
from news reading, and are thus essentially writ-
ten language although delivered orally.
4 Pauses and focusing in Danish
The purpose of this pilot study is, on the basis
of the annotated DanPass corpus, to verify i. to
what degree pauses tend to be associated with fo-
cus and topic, and ii. where in the focus domain
pauses tend to occur, particularly whether pauses
are used to mark the left-hand focus boundary.
Since we already know from the studies cited
above that there is a strong tendency for pauses
to coincide with clause boundaries, we decided
192
F word T word No tag Total
Pause 20.29 7.59 39.70 28.34
No pause 79.71 92.41 60.30 71.66
Total 100 100 100 100
Table 2: Distribution of pauses over information
structure categories (%)
to exclude those from the study, and only look
at pauses that occur within clauses. So far, the
investigation has been carried out for the network
description part of the corpus, and only for the
data produced by one of the coders.
The first question – whether pauses relate to
words coded as either focus or topic – was inves-
tigated by counting, out of a total 3659 words,
how many words tagged as either F or T, or bear-
ing no tag, are preceded by a pause (silent or non
silent). The results, shown in Tables (2), seem
to disconfirm the hypothesis that there should
be a correlation between pauses and information
structure categories, or at least that a correlation,
if it exists, can be expressed by looking at the fre-
quency with which pauses precede focus or topic
words. In fact, over 65% of the intra-clausal
pauses in the material precede untagged words,
and the observed frequency of a pause before a
focus or a topic word is lower than the average
28.34% (baseline).
Since we know that topics often occur
sentence-initially, the results in the tables are
misleading in that only intra-clausal pauses are
taken into consideration. Therefore we also
looked at what percentage of topic words are
succeeded rather than preceded by a pause, and
found that 33.50% are. This figure is interesting,
but needs further investigations.
Now we zoom in on the focus domain. First
of all, we look at pause distribution across dif-
ferent part-of-speech categories, again by in-
specting the pauses preceding words. Table (3)
shows the frequency with which different part-
of-speech categories occurring in the focus do-
main (i.e. tagged “F”) are preceded by a pause.
The total no. of words considered is 1661.
The interesting fact that emerges is that adjec-
tives have a remarkably higher probability to be
preceded by a pause than any of the other cate-
gory, and also a clearly higher probability than
the average 28.34%.
We then looked at the first pause in the fo-
cus domain. The first pause falls before the first
focus word in only 30% of the cases. In other
words, it does not seem to mark the left-hand
boundary of the focus domain. By running a de-
cision tree generator (Witten and Eibe, 2005) on
the data, we found that the strongest rule learnt
by the system was one that places the first pause
in the focus domain between a determiner and an
adjective (2). Another rule predicts that a pause
will fall between an adjective and a noun (3).
(2) tilbage er der... en/F + rød/F firkant/F
‘left there is... [F a PAUSE red square]’
(3) til venstre... lægger du en/F rød/F +
firkant/F
‘to the left... you put [F a red PAUSE
square]’
The two rules reflect a strong characteristic of
the monologues under investigation, where the
speakers have to draw the listener’s attention to
the various geometrical figures in the network
they are describing. To tell them apart from each
other, they either use the colour of the figure or
its shape. In other words, the pauses occurring
in the focus domain tend to precede the word
that expresses what Dik (1989) calls selecting fo-
cus, here an adjective that, by defining a selecting
property or type, helps distinguishing the object
in focus from other similar ones. From the point
of view of accentuation, however, the adjective is
not more prominent than the noun, and is there-
fore not annotated as the only word in focus.
5 Conclusions and further research
In conclusion, the pilot study shows that words
making up the topic or the focus of a sentence
do not show a general tendency to be preceded
by pauses. However, preliminary results indicate
that topics tend to be followed by pauses. Fur-
thermore, words belonging to specific syntatic
193

No pause 63.66 93.06 83.33 81.03 82.89 80.17 75.00 95.24 93.67 80.00 79.71
Total 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100
Table 3: Distribution of pauses over part-of-speech categories in the focus domain (%)
categories may have a significantly higher proba-
bility to be preceded by a pause than a randomly
chosen word. In the corpus we have worked
with, these words express the property or seman-
tic type whereby the object in focus can be dis-
tinguished from other similar objects. In other
words, the system by which Danish speakers use
pauses seems sensitive to information structure
in a subtle way that, at least as far as focus is
concerned, creates boundaries that do not neces-
sarily correspond to those between syntactic con-
stituents.
An interesting issue we haven’t yet ad-
dressed is whether intra-clausal pauses relate to
prosodic phrases, which according to Steedman
(2001) correspond to information structural con-
stituents. Since the DanPass annotation also
foresees a tier for prosodic phrases, this inves-
tigation is possible. Furthermore, we want to
test whether there are differences in the way in
which different users relate pauses to topic es-
tablishment and focusing. We know already now
that the percentage of pauses per word varies
across speakers, and that speakers’ individual
pause rates do not vary much depending on the
task. The corpus provides a very nice means of
studying whether they use pauses for different
purposes.
