This paper looks at representing para- 
phrases using the formalism of Syn- 
chronous TAGs; it looks particularly at 
comparisons with machine translation and 
the modifications it is necessary to make 
to Synchronous TAGs for paraphrasing. A 
more detailed version is in Dras (1997a). 
1 In t roduct ion  
The context of the paraphrasing in this work is 
that of Reluctant Paraphrase (Dras, 1997b). In 
this framework, a paraphrase is a tool for modify- 
ing a text to fit a set of constraints like length or 
lexical density. As such, generally applicable para- 
phrases are appropriate, so syntactic paraphrases-- 
paraphrases that can be represented in terms of a 
mapping between syntax trees describing each of the 
paraphrase alternatives--have b en chosen for their 
general applicability. Three examples are: 
(1) a. The salesman made an attempt o wear 
Steven down. 
b. The salesman attempted to wear Steven 
down. 
(2) a. The compere who put the contestant to 
the lie detector gained the cheers of the 
audience. 
b. The compere put the contestant to the 
lie detector test. He gained the cheers 
of the audience. 
(3) a. The smile broke his composure. 
b. His composure was broken by the smile. 
A possible approach for representing paraphrases 
is that of Chandrasekar et al (1996) in the context of 
text simplification. This involves a fairly straightfor- 
ward representation, as the focus is on paraphrases 
which simplify sentences by breaking them apart. 
However, for purposes other than sentence simplifi- 
cation, where paraphrases like (1) are used, a more 
complex representation is needed. 
A paraphrase representation can be thought of as 
comprising two parts--a representation for each of 
the source and target texts, and a representation 
for mapping between them. Tree Adjoining Gram- 
mars (TAGs) cover the first part: as a formalism 
for describing the syntactic aspects of text, they 
have a number of desirable features. The proper- 
ties of the formalism are well established (Joshi et 
al, 1975), and the research as also led to the de- 
velopment of a large standard grammar (XTAG Re- 
search Group, 1995), and a parser XTAG (Doran et 
al, 1994). Mapping between source and target texts 
is achieved by an extension to the TAG formalism 
known as Synchronous TAG, introduced by Shieber 
and Schabes (1990). Synchronous TAGs (STAGs) 
comprise a pair of trees plus links between odes of 
the trees. The original paper of Shieber and Schabes 
proposed using STAGs to map from a syntactic to 
a semantic representation, while another paper by 
Abeill@ (1990) proposed their use in machine trans- 
lation. The use in machine translation is quite close 
to the use proposed here, hence the comparison in 
the following section; instead of mapping between 
possibly different rees in different languages, there 
is a mapping between trees in the same language 
with very different syntactic properties. 
2 Paraphras ing  w i th  STAGs  
Abeill~ notes that the STAG formalism allows an 
explicit semantic representation to be avoided, map- 
ping from syntax to syntax directly. This fits well 
with the syntactic paraphrases described in this pa- 
per; but it does not, as Abeill@ also notes, pre- 
clude semantic-based mappings, with Shieber and 
Schabes constructing syntax-to-semantics mappings 
as the first demonstration f STAGs. Similarly, more 
semantically-based paraphrases are possible through 
an indirect application of STAGs to a semantic rep- 
resentation, and then back to the syntax. 
One major difference between use in MT and 
paraphrase is in lexicalisation. The sorts of map- 
pings that Abeill~ deals with are lexically idiosyn- 
cratic: the English sentences Kim likes Dale and 
Kim misses Dale, while syntactically parallel and 
semantically fairly dose, are translated to different

Figure 1: STAGs:  miss-manquer d 
syntactic structures in French; see Figure 1. The 
actual mappings depend on the properties of words, 
so any TAGs used in this synchronous manner will 
necessarily be lexicaiised. Here, however, the sorts 
of paraphrases which are used are lexically general: 
splitting off a relative clause, as in (2), is not depen- 
dent on any lexical attribute of the sentence. 
Related to this is that, at least between English 
and French, extensive syntactic mismatch is un- 
usual, much of the difficulty in translation coming 
from lexical idiosyncrasies. A consequence for ma- 
chine translation is that much of the synchronis- 
ing of TAGs is between elementary trees. So, even 
with a more complex syntactic structure than the 
translation examples above, the changes can be de- 
scribed by composing mappings between elementary 
trees, or just in the transfer lexicon. Abeill~ notes 
that there are occasions where it is necessary to re- 
place an elementary tree by a derived tree; for exam- 
ple, in Hopefully, John will work becomes On esp~re 
que Jean travaillera, hopefully (an elementary tree) 
matches on esp~re que (derived).

Figure 2: Re lat ive  clause paraphrase  
The situation is more complex in paraphrasing: 
by definition, the mappings are between units of 
text with differing syntactic properties. For exam- 
ple, the mapping of examples (2a) and (2b) involves 
the pairing of two derived trees, as in Figure 2. In 
this case, both trees are derived ones. A problem 
with the STAG formalism in this situation is that 
it doesn't capture the generality of the mapping be- 
tween (2a) and (2b); separate tree pairings will have 
to be made for verbs in the matrix clause which have 
complementation patterns different from that of the 
above examples; the same is true for verbs in the sub- 
ordinate clause. For more complex matchings, the 
making and pairing of derived trees becomes combi- 
natorially large. 
A more compact definition is to have links, of a 
kind different from the standard STAG links, be- 
tween nodes higher in the tree. In STAG, a link 
between two nodes specifies that any substitution 
or adjunction occurring at one node must be repli- 
cated at the other. This new proposed link would be 
a summary link indicating the synchronisation of an 
entire subtree: more precisely, each subnode of the 
node with the summary link is mapped to the cor- 
responding node in the paired tree in a synchronous 
depth-first raversal of the subtree. Naturally, this 
can only be defined for pairs of nodes which have 
the same structure 1 ; that is, in the context of para- 
phrasing, it is effectively a statement that the paired 
subtrees are identical. So, for example, a mapping 
between the nodes labelled VP1 in each of the trees 
of the example described above would be an appro- 
priate place to have such a summary link: by es- 
tablishing a mapping between each subnode of VP1, 
this covers different ypes of matrix clauses. 
Another feature of using STAGs for paraphras- 
ing is that the links are not necessarily one-to-one. 
In the right-hand tree of the Figure 2 pairing, the 
subject NPs of both sentences are linked to NP1 of 
the left-hand tree; this is a statement that both re- 
sulting sentences have the same subject. This does 
not, however, change the properties in any signifi- 
cant way. 2 
It is also useful to add another type of link which 
is non-standard, in that it is not just a link between 
nodes at which adjunction and substitution occur, 
but which represents shared attributes. It connects 
nodes such as the main verb of each tree, and indi- 
cates that particular attributes are held in common. 
For example, mapping between active and passive 
voice versions of a sentence is represented by the 
tree in Figure 3. The verb in the active version of 
(3) (broke) shares the attribute of tense with the 
auxiliary verb \be\, and the lexical component is 
shared with the main verb of the passive tree (bro- 
1More precisely, they need only have the same num- 
ber and type of argument slots. 
2This is equivalent to there being m dummy child 
nodes of the node at the multiple end of an m:l link, 
each child node being exactly the same as the parent 
with fully re-entrant feature structures, with one link 
being systematically allocated to each child.

ken), which takes the past participle form. This sort 
of link is unnecessary when STAGs are used in MT, 
as the trees are lexicalised, and the information is 
shared in the transfer lexicon. Since, with para- 
phrasing, the transfer lexicon does not play such a 
role, the shared information is represented by this 
new type of link between the trees, where the links 
are labelled according to the information shared. 
Hence, node 1/1 in the active tree has a TENSE link 
with node Vo in the passive tree, where tense is the 
attribute in common; and a LEX link with node I/1 
in the passive tree, where the lexeme is shared. 3
3 Notat ion  
In paraphrasing, the tree notation thus becomes 
fairly clumsy: as well as consuming a large amount of 
space (given the large derived trees), it fails to reflect 
the generality provided by the summary links. That 
is, it is not possible to define a mapping between 
two structures reflecting their common features if 
the structures are not, as is standard in STAG, en- 
tire elementary or derived trees. Therefore, a new 
and more compact notation is proposed to overcome 
these two disadvantages. 
The new notation has three parts: the first part 
uniquely defines each tree of a synchronous tree pair; 
the second part describes, also uniquely, the nodes 
that will be part of the links; the third part links 
the trees via these nodes. So, let variables X and 
Y stand for any string of argument ypes accept- 
able in tree names; for example, X could be nxlnx2 
and Y nl. Then, for example, the tree for (2a) 
can be defined as the adjunction of a flN0nx0VX 
tree (generic relative clause tree, standing for, e.g., 
~N0nx0Vnxlnx2) into an an0VY tree; the tree for 
(2b) can be defined as a conjoined S tree, having 
a parent Sm node and 2 child nodes an0VX and 
an0VY.

The second part of the notation requires pick- 
ing out important nodes. The identification scheme

proposed here has a string comprising node labels 
with relations between them, signifying a relation- 
ship taken from the set {parent, child, left-sibling, 
right-sibling}, abbreviated {p, c, ls, rs}. The node 
NP1 of the left-hand tree of Figure 2 can then be 
described by the string NPpNPpSrpNIL; an asso- 
ciated mnemonic nickname might be T1 subjNP. 
The third part of the representation is then link- 
ing the nodes. Standard links are represented by 
an equal sign; other links are represented with the 
link type subscripted to the equal sign. Thus, 
for Figure 2, TlsubjNP=TfleftsubjNP, where 
T21eftsubjNP is NPpSrpSmpNIL for the right- 
hand tree. 
For a tabular representation using this notation, 
see Dras (1997a). 
4 Conc lus ion  
Synchronous TAGs are a useful representation for 
paraphrasing, the mapping between parallel texts 
of the same language which have different syntac- 
tic structure. A number of modifications need to be 
made, however, to properly capture the nature of 
paraphrases: the creation of a new type of summary 
link, to compensate for the increased importance of 
derived trees; the allowing of many-to-many links 
between trees; the creation of partial links, which 
allow some information to be shared; and a new no- 
tation which expresses the generality of paraphras- 
ing.
