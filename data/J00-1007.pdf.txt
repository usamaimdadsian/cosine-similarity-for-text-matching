Architectures and 
Mechanisms for 
Language Processing 
Matthew W. Crocker, 
Martin Pickering, and 
Charles Clifton, Jr., E~litors 
The architectures and mechanisms 
underlying hnguage processing form 
one important part of the general 
structure of cognition. This book, 
written by leading experts in the field, 
brings together linguistic, psychological, 
and computational perspectives on some 
of the fundamental issues. Several general 
introductory chapters offer overviews on 
important psycholinguistic research 
frameworks and highlight both shared 
assumptions and controversial issues. 
Subsequent chapters explore syntactic 
and lexical mechanisms, the interaction 
of syntax and semantics in language 
understanding, and the implications 
for cognitive architecture.

Phonetic Association 
This book is a comprehensive guide to the 
International Phonetic Alphabet, widely 
used for over a century to transcribe the 
sounds of languages. The Handbook is in 
three parts: Part I contains an introductio 
to phonetic description and exemplificatk 
of the use of phonetic symbols; Part II 
consists of twenty-nine "Illustrations" of 
the application of the International Phon~ 
Alphabet o a range of languages; and Par1 
III covers peech pathology, computer 
codings, and the history of the IPA. This : 
an essential reference work for phoneticia~ 
and linguists more generally.

Causality 
Models, Reasoning, and Inference 
Judea Pearl 
"Judea Pearl has come to statistics and 
causation with enthusiasm and creativity. 
His work is always thought provoking and 
worth careful study. This book proves to be 
no exception. Time and again I found myself 
disagreeing both with his assumptions and 
with his conclusions, but I was also fascinated 
by new insights into problems I thought I 
already understood well. This book illustrates 
the rich contributions Pearl has made to statis- 
tical literature and to our collective under- 
standing of models for causal reasoning. " 
-Stephen Fienberg, Maurice Falk 
University Pro3~ssor f Statistics and 
Social Sdence, Carnegie Mellon University 
"This book on causal inference by a brilliant 
computer scientist will both delight and inform 
all--philosophers, psychologists, epidemiologists, 
computer scientists, lawyers--who appreciate 
the intriguing problem of causation posed 
by David Hume more than two and a half 
centuries ago." 
-Patricia Cheng, Department of 
P,ychology, University of Callforni~ 
Los Angeles 
"... This book should prove invaluable to 
researchers in artificial intelligence, statistics, 
economics, epidemiology, and philosophy, 
and, indeed, all those interested in the funda- 
mental notion of causality. It may well prove 
to be one of the most influential books of the 
next decade." 
-Joseph Halpern, Computer Science 
Department, Cornell University 
Written by one of the preeminent scientists in 
the field, this book provides acomprehensive 
exposition of modern analysis of causation. 
It shows how causality has grown from a 
nebulous concept into a mathematical theory 
with significant applications in diverse fields.

Building Natural Language 
Generation Systems 
Ehud Reiter and Robert Dale 
This book explains how to build 
Natural Language Generation (NLG) 
systems--computer software systems that 
automatically generate understandable texts 
in English or other human languages. NLG 
systems use knowledge about language and 
the application domain to automatically 
produce documents, reports, explanations, 
help messages, and other kinds of texts. The 
book covers the algorithms and representations 
needed to perform the core tasks of document 
planning, microplanning, and surface realiza- 
tion, using a case study to show how these 
components fit together. It is essential reading 
for researchers interested in NLP, AI, and 
HCI; and for developers interested in
advanced ocument-creation technology.

Coarticulation 
Theory, Data and Techniques 
William J. Hardcastle and 
Nigel Hewlett, Ed/tors 
Coarticulation means the overlapping 
that occur during the pronunciation of any 
sequence of speech sounds. This topic in 
the science of phonetics provides achallenge 
to speech production theory as well as to 
various projects in the field of speech tech- 
nology, including that of building a natural 
sounding speech synthesizer. The eighteen 
chapters in this book cover the experimental 
techniques used for investigating the 
phenomenon, the experimental findings 
to date, and the theoretical background.

Outstanding New Scholarship 
Causality 
Models, Reasoning, and Inference 
Judea Pear l  
• Presents the first unified account of the various approaches to
causation 
• Offers simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships 
between causal connections and statistical ssociations 
• Will facilitate the incorporation of causal analysis as an integral 
part of the standard curriculum in statistics, business, epidemiology, 
social science, and economics 
• Students will find natural models, simple identification procedures, 
and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts 
~\D {~-ERI '-,( \[ 
• Causal concepts treated include: actions, exogeneity, confounding, direct and indirect effects, 
ignorability, Simpson's paradox, structural equations, path coefficients, instrumental variables, 
attribution, explanation, probability of causation and single-event causation 
"Without assuming much beyond elementary probability theory, Judea Pearl's book provides 
an attractive tour of recent work, in which he has played a central role, on causal models and 
causal reasoning. Due to his efforts, and that of a few others, a Renaissance in thinking and 
using causal concepts i taking place."

This is the official publication of the European Association for Logic, Language, and 
Information. The scope of the journal is the logical and computational foundations 
of natural, formal, and programming languages, as well as the different forms of 
human and mechanized inference. It covers the logical, linguistic, and information- 
theoretic parts of the cognitive sciences. Examples of main subareas are Intensional 
Logics including Dynamic Logic; Nonmonotonic Logic and Belief Revision; 
Constructive Logics; Complexity Issues in Logic and Linguistics; Theoretical Problems 
of Logic Programming and Resolution; Categorial Grammar and Type Theory; 
Generalized Quantification; Information-Oriented Theories of Semantic Structure 
like Situation Semantics, Discourse Representation Theory, and Dynamic Semantics; 
Connectionist Models of Logical and Linguistic Structures. The emphasis is on the 
theoretical aspects of these areas. The purpose of the journal is to act as a forum 
for researchers interested in the theoretical foundations of the above subjects and 
their interdisciplinary connections, with an emphasis on general ideas increasing 
coherence.

(List total in PAYMENT SECTION) 
BENEFITS, PAYMENT AND ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS 
Membership in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of  when dues are paid. 
Membership includes a full year of  the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at most ACL-sponsored 
conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, fund donations, back issues, and 
proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. IMPORTANT NOTE: Renewals must be received no later than 1 April 
2000 to avoid late payment fee assessment. Membership categories include Regular Members and the following: Couples 
with the same mailing address may be Joint Members; they will receive only one set of  publications, but each will be eligible 
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may become 
Student Members WITH COPY OF CURRENT STUDENT ID. Students who are not Student Members because of  their 
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed 
memberships. We now offer MULTI -YEAR MEMBERSHIPS to Regular and Joint members. If no indication is provided 
of  multi-year membership preference, one-year membership will be presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does 
not apply to new memberships.

Guidel ines for Submissions 
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced and single-sided throughout, including footnotes and refer- 
ences. The paper should begin with an iriformative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. 
Manuscripts must be written in English. Contact he edltor egarding the possibility of electronic 
submission. 
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: 
Papers: This category includes contributions that report significant new research results in com- 
putational linguistics or that provide critical reviews of the literature on a particular topic. The 
length of a paper depends on its content, but it is suggested that manuscripts be limited to 
forty double-spaced.pages. That is the equivalent of thirty journal pages. Each paper is fully 
refereed by three or four experts in the field. Manuscripts may also be submitted electroni- 
cally; consult http://www.aclweb.org/cl/submit.txt for instructions and pointers to the L TEX 
style files. The submission of an article to CL for .refereeing means that the author certifies 
the manuscript is not copyrighted; nor has it been published or submitted for publication to 
another efereed journal. If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in a non- 
refereed publication, the details of such publication must be made known to the Editor at 
the time of submission. The final version of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must 
be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the 
case of a "work for hire," by the employer. This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 
U.S. Copyright law. 
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant o the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con- 
tributions for inclusion. 
Five copies of papers or three copies of letters hould be sent to:

(+1 973) 360-8330; acl@research.att.com. 
Squibs and Discussions: This category includes hort articles reporting technical results, dis- 
cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest o the 
journal readership. Submission format is the same as for regular papers, but the length should 
in no case exceed eight journal pages. Electronic submissions (LTEX source, postscript or plain 
text) are welcome and should be submitted to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and 
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was 
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing 
Cdmputational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring 
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural 
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics 
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation , Computational Phonology, MulRmedia Language 
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; 
others are likely to be added.
