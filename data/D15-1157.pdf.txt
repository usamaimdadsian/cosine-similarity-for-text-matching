Abstract
We present a new treebank of English and
French technical forum content which has
been annotated for grammatical errors and
phrase structure. This double annotation
allows us to empirically measure the effect
of errors on parsing performance. While
it is slightly easier to parse the corrected
versions of the forum sentences, the errors
are not the main factor in making this kind
of text hard to parse.
1 Introduction
The last five years has seen a considerable amount
of research carried out on web and social me-
dia text parsing, with new treebanks being cre-
ated (Foster et al., 2011; Seddah et al., 2012; Mott
et al., 2012; Kong et al., 2014), and new parsing
systems developed (Petrov and McDonald, 2012;
Kong et al., 2014). In this paper we explore a par-
ticular source of user-generated text, namely, posts
from technical support forums, which are a pop-
ular means for customers to resolve their queries
about a product. An accurate parser for this kind
of text can be used to inform forum-level question-
answering, machine translation and quality esti-
mation of machine translation.
We create a 2000-sentence treebank called
Foreebank which contains sentences from the
Symantec Norton English and French technical
support forums.
1
The phrase structure of the sen-
tences is annotated and any grammatical errors are
marked in the trees. Marking the grammatical er-
rors allows us to precisely measure the amount of
grammatical noise in this kind of text, and joint er-
ror and syntactic annotation allows us to determine
its effect on parsing.

Foster (2010) explored the effect of spelling er-
rors on parsing performance of conversational fo-
rum text. We extend this study to include gram-
matical errors, focusing on more technical con-
tent. Foster et al. (2008) explored the effect of
artificially generated grammatical errors on Wall
Street Journal parsing. We concentrate on forum
text rather than newspaper text, and, crucially, ex-
amine the effect of real grammatical errors. We
find that the level of grammatical noise is lower
than expected, with capitalisation and punctuation
errors being the most frequent. While correcting
all the errors does result in a performance increase
of 1.5% for English and 0.8% for French, the ma-
jor challenge in parsing these sentences seems not
to be “bad language” (Eisenstein, 2013) per se.
The main contribution of the paper is the Foree-
bank data set itself
2
but we also carry out prelim-
inary parsing experiments evaluating the accuracy
of a PCFG-LA parser on Foreebank, examining
the effect of grammatical errors on parsing and ex-
perimenting with different training sets.
2 Related Work
Other treebanks of English web text include the
English Web Treebank (aka Google Web Tree-
bank) (Mott et al., 2012), the small treebank of
tweets and football discussion forum posts de-
scribed in Foster et al. (2011) and the tweet de-
pendency bank described in Kong et al. (2014).
The English Web Treebank is a corpus of over
250K words, selected from blogs, newsgroups,
emails, local business reviews and Yahoo! an-
swers. It adapts the Penn Treebank (Marcus et
al., 1994) and Switchboard (Taylor, 1996) annota-
tion guidelines to address the phenomena specific

to this type of text. The annotation of the 1000-
sentence treebank described in Foster et al. (2011)
is based on the Penn Treebank, whereas the an-
notation of the treebank described in Kong et al.
(2014) is dependency-based. The French Social
Media Bank developed by Seddah et al. (2012) is
a treebank of 1,700 French sentences from various
type of social media including Facebook, Twit-
ter and discussion forums (video game and med-
ical). An extended version of the FTB-UC annota-
tion guidelines (Candito and Crabb´e, 2009) is em-
ployed during annotation and subcorpora contain-
ing particularly noisy utterances are identified.
The main difference between Foreebank and
other web/social media treebanks is that grammat-
ical errors in the Foreebank sentences are marked
and corrected as part of the annotation process. Er-
ror annotation not only provides more insight into
this type of text but it also enables us to directly
measure the effect of these errors on parsing accu-
racy and leaves open the possibility of performing
joint parsing and error detection by directly learn-
ing the error annotation during parser training.
A learner corpus (Granger, 2008) contains utter-
ances produced by language learners and serves as
a resource for second language acquisition, com-
putational linguistic and computer-aided language
learning research. Examples include the Interna-
tional Corpus of Learner English (Granger, 1993),
the Cambridge Learner Corpus (Nicholls, 1999;
Yannakoudakis et al., 2011), the NUS Corpus of
Learner English (Dahlmeier et al., 2013) and the
German Falko corpus (L¨udeling, 2008; Rehbein et
al., 2012). We can compare Foreebank to a learner
corpus since both contain utterances that are po-
tentially ungrammatical and because in a learner
corpus the errors are often annotated, as they are
in Foreebank. In the last five years, there have
been several shared tasks in grammatical error cor-
rection including the Helping Our Own (HOO)
shared tasks of 2011 and 2012 (Dale and Kil-
gariff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012), and the CoNLL
2013 and 2014 shared tasks (Ng et al., 2013; Ng
et al., 2014). With the exception of HOO 2011,
all shared tasks involve error-annotated sentences
from learner corpora. Annotation schemes vary
but most involve marking the span of an error,
classifying the error according to some taxonomy
designed with L2 utterances in mind, and some-
times providing the correction or “target hypothe-
sis” (Hirschmann et al., 2007).
Regarding syntactic annotation of learner data,
Dickinson and Ragheb (2009) propose a depen-
dency annotation scheme based on the CHILDES
scheme (Sagae et al., 2007) developed for first lan-
guage learners. They treat the developing lan-
guage of learners as an interlanguage, as sug-
gested by D´?az-Negrillo et al. (2010), and anno-
tate it as is. They use two POS tags and two de-
pendency labels for error cases: one for the sur-
face form and one for the intended form. Ros´en
and De Smedt (2010) criticise the approach of
Dickinson and Ragheb (2009) involving “annotat-
ing language text as is” arguing that interpretation
of the language is required at all annotation lev-
els. They use NorGram, a Norwegian Lexical-
Functional Grammar, to annotate a learner cor-
pus with constituency structure, functional struc-
ture and semantic structure, in order to provide a
means to search for contexts in which learner er-
rors occur. Nagata et al. (2011) describe an En-
glish learner corpus which has been manually an-
notated with shallow syntax, introducing two new
POS tags and two new chunk labels for errors.
3 Building the Foreebank
The Foreebank treebank contains 1000 English
sentences and 1000 French sentences. The En-
glish sentences come from the Symantec Norton
technical support user forum. Half of the French
sentences come from the French Norton forum
and the other half are human translations of sen-
tences from the English forum. Four annotators
were involved in the annotation process. Their
main task was to correct automatically parsed
phrase structure trees using an annotation tool de-
veloped for this project.
3
The English annota-
tors were guided by the Penn Treebank bracket-
ing guidelines and a Foreebank-adapted version of
the English Web Treebank bracketing guidelines.
The French annotators used the French treebank
(FTB) (Abeill´e et al., 2003) guidelines, following
the SPMRL strategy for multiword expressions
(Seddah et al., 2013; Candito and Crabb´e, 2009).
The two primary annotators, one for French and
one for English, annotated all the data for their
language. The two secondary annotators anno-
tated a 100-sentence subset. Inter-annotator agree-
ment was calculated by measuring the Parseval
3
The Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) was
used to parse the English data and the Berkeley parser (Petrov
et al., 2006) was used for the French sentences.

Table 1: Foreebank Error Suffixes. The last two columns refer to their frequency.
F1 of trees produced by the secondary annotators
against those produced by the primary annotators.
For English this was 88 and for French it was 86.7.
Prior to correcting a parse tree produced by the
automatic parser, the annotators are asked to cor-
rect any errors they find in the sentence.
4
The cor-
rected text is entered in a field of the annotation
tool. As part of the syntactic annotation process,
errors are marked by appending an error suffix to
the preterminals of the affected words in the tree.
The error suffixes used in Foreebank are listed in
Table 1 and an example tree from Foreebank is
shown in Figure 1. There are three kinds of substi-
tution error suffixes: C for marking problems with
capitalisation, S for marking spelling errors and W
for marking the wrong form of a word which en-
compasses inflection errors (they instead of them),
real-word spelling errors (test instead of text) and
lexical choice errors (desk instead of chair). The
POS tag of the corrected form is used in the tree
instead of the POS tag of the incorrect form.
5
Al-
though this annotation scheme contains fewer er-
ror types than the taxonomies used for learner cor-
4
Minimal correction is encouraged to prevent annotators
from rewriting the sentence in their preferred writing style.
Instead they are instructed to just focus on fixing the errors.
5
An alternative would have been to use one POS tag for
the erroneous form and one for the corrected form, either
combined a la Nagata et al. (2011) or separate a la Dickin-
son and Ragheb (2009).
pora, its granularity increases when the error suf-
fixes are interpreted in the syntactic context in
which they occur. For example, we can distin-
guish a missing determiner (DT D) from a missing
preposition (IN D).
The “sentences” that the annotators see are the
result of passing the forum text through an auto-
matic sentence splitter (NLTK
6
) and tokeniser (in-
house). This is another important difference be-
tween Foreebank and the English Web Treebank
(EWT). In the EWT, sentence boundary detec-
tion and tokenisation has been carried out manu-
ally before annotation. Both approaches are valid
but ours was chosen in order to stay closer to the
more realistic scenario of less than perfect auto-
matic preprocessing tools. This means that anno-
tators have a special class of errors that result from
noisy sentence splitting and tokenisation that must
be marked during annotation.
There are two types of sentence splitting errors:
merged sentences such as (1) in which a sentence
boundary was not detected before the word When
due to the use of a comma instead of a full stop,
and split sentences such as (2).
(1) 7. Combofix will start, When it
is scanning don’t move the
mouse cursor inside the box,
(2) The questions to <CompanyName>:
6
http://www.nltk.org/
1343
Merged sentences are gathered under one root
node with the error suffix M (e.g. S M) , and split
sentences are annotated as if they are standalone.
Tokenisation problems can also be categorised
as merged (3) or split (4 and 5). Merged tokens
are treated as a combination of a spelling error
(whenI instead of when) and a deleted token (I).
When the split is morphological as in (4), they are
tagged with the POS tag of the whole intended to-
ken, along with the error suffix B (for “broken”).
So in (4), the POS tag of anti would be annotated
as NN B and the POS tag of vir as NN B. When
there is no such clean morphological break (as in
(5)), the first token is treated as a spelling error and
the second as an extraneous token.
(3) whenI tried to use ...
(4) he should buy anti vir programs
(5) i t keeps causing <ProductName>
to lock up ...
4 Analysing the Foreebank
Table 2 presents the average and the maximum
sentence length in Foreebank, and, for compar-
ison, WSJ and FTB. It also gives the out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) rate of these data sets with re-
spect to the WSJ and FTB. The Foreebank sen-
tences are shorter on average than the WSJ and
FTB sentences. The table also shows that the
OOV rate of Foreebank with respect to WSJ/FTB
is high: 33.3% for English and 39.1% for French.
These numbers can be compared to the OOV rate
of the WSJ test set with respect to its training set
which is 13.2% and the FTB which is 20.6%. The
higher OOV rate for the French Foreebank com-
pared to the English is most likely due to the larger
size of the WSJ compared to the FTB. The OOV
rate of the English Foreebank is more than 2.5
times as large as that of the WSJ test set, while
the OOV rate of the French Foreebank is less than
2 times as large as that of the FTB test set. This
suggests that a bigger performance drop due to un-
known words should be expected in parsing the
English Foreebank sentences than the French.
The last four columns in Table 1 display the ab-
solute and relative frequency of each error suffix.
In sum, it seems that capitalisation is the major
error type in Foreebank especially in the French
data. Deleted tokens are also a major source of
problem on the English side. Most of the capital-
isation errors involve proper nouns (e.g. product
names) and most of the deleted tokens are cases

of missing punctuation. Overall, the errors oc-
cur on only a small fraction of the tokens in both
data sets. We also calculate the edit distance be-
tween each Foreebank sentence and its correction
by summing the number of error suffixes and di-
viding by the maximum of the original and cor-
rected sentence lengths. The average edit dis-
tance for the English section of Foreebank is 0.04
and for the French section is 0.03. Despite the
existence of some near-to-incomprehensible sen-
tences, the overall error level is very low.
5 Parsing the Foreebank
We first evaluate newswire-trained parsers on
Foreebank, using our in-house PCFG-LA parser
with the max-rule parsing algorithm (Petrov and
Klein, 2007) and 6 split-merge cycles. The En-
glish model is trained on the entire WSJ and the
French model on the entire FTB. For compari-
son, we parse the WSJ/FTB and so we addition-
ally use models trained only on the training sec-
tions. We remove the error suffixes and any D-
suffixed nodes (representing deleted words) from
the gold Foreebank trees before evaluation. The
results are shown in Table 3. As expected, we see a
significant drop for both languages when we move
from in-domain data to Foreebank. Compared to
parsing the English side of Foreebank, the perfor-
mance drop for French is relatively smaller: the
former drops 14.2 points from 89.6 F
1
points to
75.4 and the latter 5.3 points from 81.3 to 76. This
suggests that, either the French parsing model is
better generalisable to the forum text, or alterna-
tively, that the FTB test set is more distant from its
training set than the WSJ one. The second hypoth-
1344
esis is more likely because 1) it is on par with the
OOV rate observed in Section 4, and 2) the perfor-
mance of the English and French parsers are close
on Foreebank but further apart on the newswire
test sets. The effect of using the entire WSJ and
FTB instead of only their training sections is also
worth noting. While adding the WSJ development
and test sets (about 5,500 sentences, a 14% in-
crease) improves the F
1
of English parsing by 1.6
points, the 2,500 FTB development and test sen-
tences (a 25% increase) have little effect on the
French parsing, suggesting that either these new
sentences are still not enough or do not bring ad-
ditional information to the parsing model.
Since the annotators correct the errors made by
the forum users, we are able to parse the corrected
versions of the Foreebank sentences and examine
how accurately they are parsed compared to the
original sentences. We use the WSJ
all
and FTB
all
parsing models described above. Correcting the
user errors before parsing leads to an improved
parsing F
1
of 78.6 for the English sentences, an
increase of 1.6 points (2%). A smaller impact is
observed on the French sentences where the edited
sentences receive an F
1
of 77.1 (an increase of 0.8
points). Referring to the distribution of error suf-
fixes in Table 1, this suggests that the inserted and
deleted tokens may have a larger effect on parser
error than the substituted tokens, as their number
is higher for English. Many substitution errors are
capitalisation errors, typically involving a confu-
sion between proper and common nouns, which
tends not to affect the surrounding tree.
The simplest method to improve the accuracy
of parsing Foreebank is to use it as supplemen-
tary training data. We do this using a 5-fold cross
validation, in which Foreebank is randomly split
into five parts, with each part used for the evalu-
ation of the parsers trained on WSJ/FTB plus the
other four parts. The results are shown in Table 4.
Combining the larger treebank and Foreebank im-
proves the F
1
by 2.6 points for English and 3.2 for
French. Considering that Foreebank is orders of
magnitude smaller than the WSJ/FTB, these gains
are encouraging. We try to overcome the small
size of Foreebank by 1) using the EWT as training
data, and 2) increasing the weight of Foreebank by
training on multiple copies of it. The EWT is not
a substitute for the WSJ but it does provide a mod-
est improvement when used in conjunction with
Foreebank and WSJ. The replication of Foreebank

Table 4: Training on Foreebank/WSJ/EWT/FTB
and testing on Foreebank
trees has mixed results, providing a 0.5 point im-
provement for English and none for French.
In all experiments up to now, we have excluded
the error suffixes from the Foreebank trees (dur-
ing training and testing). We next try to directly
learn trees containing the error suffixes (except for
deleted tokens). That is, we use the original Foree-
bank trees containing the error suffixes for train-
ing and evaluate against Foreebank trees contain-
ing the error suffixes. The second last row of Ta-
ble 4 shows the 5-fold CV results when the version
of Foreebank without the error suffixes is used for
training and the last row the results when the er-
ror suffixes are included. Including the suffixes
decreases the accuracy, most likely due to the in-
creased data sparsity caused by the suffixed tags.
6 Conclusion
We have introduced a treebank of technical fo-
rum sentences for English and French, based on an
annotation strategy adapted to suit user-generated
text in a realistic NLP setting. By marking the er-
rors on the trees, we studied their prevalence as
well as their impact on parsing and found that de-
spite their low frequency, they do negatively af-
fect parser performance, while not being the most
important factor. Our next steps include learning
error suffixes during a prior tagging phase and ex-
perimenting with the French Social Media Bank.
