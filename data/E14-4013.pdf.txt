Abstract
We train and evaluate two models for Ro-
manian stress prediction: a baseline model
which employs the consonant-vowel struc-
ture of the words and a cascaded model
with averaged perceptron training con-
sisting of two sequential models – one for
predicting syllable boundaries and another
one for predicting stress placement. We
show in this paper that Romanian stress is
predictable, though not deterministic, by
using data-driven machine learning tech-
niques.
1 Introduction
Romanian is a highly inflected language with a
rich morphology. As dictionaries usually fail to
cover the pronunciation aspects for all word forms
in languages with such a rich and irregular mor-
phology (Sef et al., 2002), we believe that a
data-driven approach is very suitable for syllabi-
cation and stress prediction for Romanian words.
Moreover, such a system proves extremely useful
for inferring syllabication and stress placement for
out-of-vocabulary words, for instance neologisms
or words which recently entered the language.
Even if they are closely related, Romanian
stress and syllabication were unevenly studied in
the computational linguistic literature, i.e., the
Romanian syllable received much more attention
than the Romanian stress (Dinu and Dinu, 2005;
Dinu, 2003; Dinu et al., 2013; Toma et al., 2009).
One possible explanation for the fact that Roma-
nian syllabication was more intensively studied
than Romanian stress is the immediate application
of syllabication to text editors which need reliable
hyphenation. Another explanation could be that
most linguists (most recently Dindelegan (2013))
insisted that Romanian stress is not predictable,
thus discouraging attempts to investigate any sys-
tematic patterns.
Romanian is indeed a challenging case study,
because of the obvious complexities of the data
with respect to stress assignment. At first sight, no
obvious patterns emerge for learning stress place-
ment (Dindelegan, 2013), other than as part of in-
dividual lexical items. The first author who chal-
lenges this view is Chitoran (2002), who argues in
favor of the predictability of the Romanian stress
system. She states that stress placement strongly
depends on the morphology of the language, more
precisely on the distribution of the lexical items
based on their part of speech (Chitoran, 1996).
Thus, considering this type of information, lexical
items can be clustered in a limited number of re-
gular subpatterns and the unpredictability of stress
placement is significantly reduced. A rule-based
method for lexical stress prediction on Romanian
was introduced by Oancea and Badulescu (2002).
Dou et al. (2009) address lexical stress predic-
tion as a sequence tagging problem, which proves
to be an accurate approach for this task. The
effectiveness of using conditional random fields
for orthographic syllabication is investigated by
Trogkanis and Elkan (2010), who employ them
for determining syllable boundaries and show that
they outperform previous methods. Bartlett et
al. (2008) use a discriminative tagger for auto-
matic orthographic syllabication and present seve-
ral approaches for assigning labels, including the
language-independent Numbered NB tag scheme,
which labels each letter with a value equal to the
distance between the letter and the last syllable
boundary. According to Damper et al. (1999), syl-
lable structure and stress pattern are very useful in
text-to-speech synthesis, as they provide valuable
knowledge regarding the pronunciation modeling.
Besides converting the letters to the corresponding
phonemes, information about syllable boundaries
and stress placement is also needed for the correct
synthesizing of a word in grapheme-to-phoneme
conversion (Demberg et al., 2007).
64
In this paper, we rely on the assumption that the
stress system of Romanian is predictable. We pro-
pose a system for automatic prediction of stress
placement and we investigate its performance by
accounting for several fine-grained characteristics
of Romanian words: part of speech, number of
syllables and consecutive vowels. We investigate
the consonant-vowel structure of the words (C/V
structure) and we detect a high number of stress
patterns. This calls for the need of machine learn-
ing techniques, in order to automatically learn
such a wide range of variational patterns.
2 Approach
We address the task of stress prediction for Roma-
nian words (out-of-context) as a sequence tagging
problem. In this paper, we account only for the pri-
mary stress, but this approach allows further deve-
lopment in order to account for secondary stress
as well. We propose a cascaded model consist-
ing of two sequential models trained separately,
the output of the first being used as input for the
second. We use averaged perceptron for parame-
ter estimation and three types of features which are
described in detail further in this section: n-grams
of characters, n-grams marking the C/V structure
of the word and binary positional indicators of the
current character with respect to the syllable struc-
ture of the word. We use one sequential model
to predict syllable boundaries and another one to
predict stress placement. Previous work on or-
thographic syllabication for Romanian (Dinu et
al., 2013) shows that, although a rule-based algo-
rithm models complex interactions between fea-
tures, its practicality is limited. The authors re-
port experiments on a Romanian dataset, where
the rule-based algorithm is outperformed by an
SVM classifier and a CRF system with character
n-gram features.
We use a simple tagging structure for mar-
king primary stress. The stressed vowel re-
ceives the positive tag 1, while all previous cha-
racters are tagged 0 and all subsequent ones
2. This structure helps enforce the uniqueness
of the positive tag. The main features used
are character n-grams up to n = W in a win-
dow of radius W around the current position.
For example, if W = 2, the feature template
consists of c[-2], c[-1], c[0], c[1], c[2],
c[-2:-1], c[-1:0], c[0:1], c[1:2]. If the
current letter is the fourth of the word dinosaur,
o, the feature values would be i, n, o, s, a, in, no,
os, sa. We use two additional types of features:
• features regarding the C/V structure of the
word: n-grams using, instead of characters,
markers for consonants (C) and vowels (V);
• binary indicators of the following positional
statements about the current character, re-
lated to the statistics reported in Table 1:
– exactly before/after a split;
– in the first/second/third/fourth syllable
of the word, counting from left to right;
– in the first/second/third/fourth syllable
of the word, counting from right to left
The syllabication prediction is performed with
another sequential model of length n? 1, where
each node corresponds to a position between two
characters. Based on experimenting and previ-
ous work, we adopted the Numbered NB labeling.
Each position is labeled with an integer denoting
the distance from the previous boundary. For ex-
ample, for the word diamond, the syllable (above)
and stress annotations (below) are as follows:
d i a m o n d
1 0 0 1 2 3
0 1 2 2 2 2 2
The features used for syllabication are based on
the same principle, but because the positions are
in-between characters, the window of radius W
has length 2W instead of 2W + 1. For this model
we used only character n-grams as features.
3 Data
We run our experiments for Romanian using the
RoSyllabiDict (Barbu, 2008) dictionary, which is
a dataset of annotated words comprising 525,528
inflected forms for approximately 65,000 lemmas.
This is, to our best knowledge, the largest experi-
ment conducted and reported for Romanian so far.
For each entry, the syllabication and the stressed
vowel (and, in case of ambiguities, also grammat-
ical information or type of syllabication) are pro-
vided. For example, the word copii (children) has
the following representation:
<form w="copii" obs="s."> co-píi</form>
We investigate stress placement with regard to
the syllable structure and we provide in Table 1
the percentages of words having the stress placed
on different positions, counting syllables from the
beginning and from the end of the words as well.
For our experiments, we discard words which
do not have the stressed vowel marked, compound

We investigate the C/V structure of the words in
RoSyllabiDict using raw data, i.e., a, a?, â, e, i, î, o,
u are always considered vowels and the rest of the
letters in the Romanian alphabet are considered
consonants. Thus, we identify a very large number
of C/V structures, most of which are not determin-
istic with regard to stress assignment, having more
then one choice for placing the stress

4 Experiments and Results
In this section we present the main results drawn
from our research on Romanian stress assignment.
4.1 Experiments
We train and evaluate a cascaded model consist-
ing of two sequential models trained separately,
the output of the first being used as input to the
second. We split the dataset in two subsets: train
set (on which we perform cross-validation to se-
lect optimal parameters for our model) and test
set (with unseen words, on which we evaluate the
performance of our system). We use the same
train/test sets for the two sequential models, but
they are trained independently. The output of the
first model (used for predicting syllabication) is
used for determining feature values for the second
one (used for predicting stress placement) for the
test set. The second model is trained using gold
syllabication (provided in the dataset) and we re-
port results on the test set in both versions: us-
ing gold syllabication to determine feature values
1
For example, for CCV-CVC structure (1,390 occurrences
in our dataset) there are 2 associated stress patterns: CCV-
CVC (1,017 occurrences) and CCV-CVC (373 occurrences).
Words with 6 syllables cover the highest number of distinct
C/V structures (5,749). There are 31 C/V structures (rang-
ing from 4 to 7 syllables) reaching the maximum number of
distinct associated stress patterns (6).
and using predicted syllabication to determine fea-
ture values. The results with gold syllabication
are reported only for providing an upper bound for
learning and for comparison.
We use averaged perceptron training (Collins,
2002) from CRFsuite (Okazaki, 2007). For the
stress prediction model we optimize hyperparam-
eters using grid search to maximize the 3-fold
cross-validation F
1
score of class 1, which marks
the stressed vowels. We searched over {2,3,4}
for W and over {1,5,10,25,50} for the maximum
number of iterations. The values which optimize
the system are 4 for W and 50 for the maximum
number of iterations. We investigate, during grid
search, whether employing C/V markers and bi-
nary positional indicators improve our system’s
performance. It turns out that in most cases they
do. For the syllabication model, the optimal hy-
perparameters are 4 for the window radius and 50
for the maximum number of iterations. We evalu-
ate the cross-validation F
1
score of class 0, which
marks the position of a hyphen. The system ob-
tains 0.995 instance accuracy for predicting sylla-
ble boundaries.
We use a "majority class" type of baseline
which employs the C/V structures described in
Section 3 and assigns, for a word in the test set,
the stress pattern which is most common in the
training set for the C/V structure of the word, or
places the stress randomly on a vowel if the C/V
structure is not found in the training set
2
. The per-
formance of both models on RoSyllabiDict dataset
is reported in Table 2. We report word-level ac-
curacy, that is, we account for words for which
the stress pattern was correctly assigned. As ex-
pected, the cascaded model performs significantly
better than the baseline.
Model Accuracy
Baseline 0.637
Cascaded model (gold) 0.975
Cascaded model (predicted) 0.973
Table 2: Accuracy for stress prediction
Further, we perform an in-depth analysis of the
sequential model’s performance by accounting for
2
For example, the word copii (meaning children) has the
following C/V structure: CV-CVV. In our training set, there
are 659 words with this structure and the three stress patterns
which occur in the training set are as follows: CV-CVV (309
occurrences), CV-CVV (283 occurrences) and CV-CVV (67
occurrences). Therefore, the most common stress pattern CV-
CVV is correctly assigned, in this case, for the word copii.

several fine-grained characteristics of the words
in RoSyllabiDict. We divide words in categories
based on the following criteria:
• part of speech: verbs, nouns, adjectives
• number of syllables: 2-8, 9+
• number of consecutive vowels: with at least
2 consecutive vowels, without consecutive
vowels

Table 3: Accuracy for cascaded model with
gold (G) and predicted (P) syllabication
We train and test the cascaded model indepen-
dently for each subcategory in the same manner as
we did for the entire dataset. We decided to use
cross-validation for parameter selection instead of
splitting the data in train/dev/test subsets in or-
der to have consistency across all models, because
some of these word categories do not comprise
enough words for splitting in three subsets (words
with more than 8 syllables, for example, have only
1,468 instances). The evaluation of the system’s
performance and the number of words in each cat-
egory are presented in Table 3.
4.2 Results Analysis
The overall accuracy is 0.975 for the cascaded
model with gold syllabication and 0.973 for the
cascaded model with predicted syllabication. The
former system outperforms the latter by only very
little. With regard to the part of speech, the high-
est accuracy when gold syllabication is used was
obtained for verbs (0.995), followed by adjectives
(0.992) and by nouns (0.979). When dividing the
dataset with respect to the words’ part of speech,
the cascaded model with predicted syllabication
is outperformed only for verbs. With only a few
exceptions, the accuracy steadily increases with
the number of syllables. The peak is reached for
words with 6 syllables when using the gold syllab-
ication and for words with 7 syllables when using
the predicted syllabication. Although, intuitively,
the accuracy should be inversely proportional to
the number of syllables, because the number of
potential positions for stress placement increases,
there are numerous stress patterns for words with
6, 7 or more syllables, which never occur in the
dataset
3
. It is interesting to notice that stress pre-
diction accuracy is almost equal for words con-
taining two or more consecutive vowels and for
words without consecutive vowels. As expected,
when words are divided in categories based on
their characteristics the system is able to predict
stress placement with higher accuracy.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we showed that Romanian stress
is predictable, though not deterministic, by using
data-driven machine learning techniques. Syllable
structure is important and helps the task of stress
prediction. The cascaded sequential model using
gold syllabication outperforms systems with pre-
dicted syllabication by only very little.
In our future work we intend to experiment with
other features as well, such as syllable n-grams
instead of character n-grams, for the sequential
model. We plan to conduct a thorough error analy-
sis and to investigate the words for which the sys-
tems did not correctly predict the position of the
stressed vowels. We intend to further investigate
the C/V structures identified in this paper and to
analyze the possibility to reduce the number of
patterns by considering details of word structure
(for example, instead of using raw data, to aug-
ment the model with annotations about which let-
ters are actually vowels) and to adapt the learning
model to finer-grained linguistic analysis.
