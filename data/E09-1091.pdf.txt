Abstract 
In this paper, we address the problem of min-
ing transliterations of Named Entities (NEs) 
from large comparable corpora. We leverage 
the empirical fact that multilingual news ar-
ticles with similar news content are rich in 
Named Entity Transliteration Equivalents 
(NETEs). Our mining algorithm, MINT, uses 
a cross-language document similarity model to 
align multilingual news articles and then 
mines NETEs from the aligned articles using a 
transliteration similarity model. We show that 
our approach is highly effective on 6 different 
comparable corpora between English and 4 
languages from 3 different language families. 
Furthermore, it performs substantially better 
than a state-of-the-art competitor.   
1 Introduction 
Named Entities (NEs) play a critical role in many 
Natural Language Processing and Information 
Retrieval (IR) tasks.  In Cross-Language Infor-
mation Retrieval (CLIR) systems, they play an 
even more important role as the accuracy of their 
transliterations is shown to correlate highly with 
the performance of the CLIR systems (Mandl 
and Womser-Hacker, 2005, Xu and Weischedel, 
2005).  Traditional methods for transliterations 
have not proven to be very effective in CLIR. 
Machine Transliteration systems (AbdulJaleel 
and Larkey, 2003; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; 
Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) usually produce 
incorrect transliterations and translation lexcions 
such as hand-crafted or statistical dictionaries are 
too static to have good coverage of NEs1 occur-
ring in the current news events. Hence, there is a 
critical need for creating and continually updat-
                                                 
* Currently with University of Utah. 
1 New NEs are introduced to the vocabulary of a lan-
guage every day. On an average, 260 and 452 new 
NEs appeared daily in the XIE and AFE segments of 
the LDC English Gigaword corpora respectively. 
ing multilingual Named Entity transliteration 
lexicons. 
The ubiquitous availability of comparable 
news corpora in multiple languages suggests a 
promising alternative to Machine Transliteration, 
namely, the mining of Named Entity Translitera-
tion Equivalents (NETEs) from such corpora. 
News stories are typically rich in NEs and there-
fore, comparable news corpora can be expected 
to contain NETEs (Klementiev and Roth, 2006; 
Tao et al., 2006). The large quantity and the per-
petual availability of news corpora in many of 
the world’s languages, make mining of NETEs a 
viable alternative to traditional approaches. It is 
this opportunity that we address in our work. 
    In this paper, we detail an effective and scala-
ble mining method, called MINT (MIning 
Named-entity Transliteration equivalents), for 
mining of NETEs from large comparable corpo-
ra. MINT addresses several challenges in mining 
NETEs from large comparable corpora: exhaus-
tiveness (in mining sparse NETEs), computa-
tional efficiency (in scaling on corpora size), 
language independence (in being applicable to 
many language pairs) and linguistic frugality (in 
requiring minimal external linguistic resources).   
Our contributions are as follows: 
? We give empirical evidence for the hypo-
thesis that news articles in different languages 
with reasonably similar content are rich sources 
of NETEs (Udupa, et al., 2008).  
? We demonstrate that the above insight can 
be translated into an effective approach for min-
ing NETEs from large comparable corpora even 
when similar articles are not known a priori. 
? We demonstrate MINT’s effectiveness on 
4 language pairs involving 5 languages (English, 
Hindi, Kannada, Russian, and Tamil) from 3 dif-
ferent language families, and its scalability on 
corpora of vastly different sizes (2,000 to 
200,000 articles).  
? We show that MINT’s performance is sig-
nificantly better than a state of the art method 
(Klementiev and Roth, 2006).

We discuss the motivation behind our ap-
proach in Section 2 and present the details in 
Section 3.  In Section 4, we describe the evalua-
tion process and in Section 5, we present the re-
sults and analysis.  We discuss related work in 
Section 6.  
2 Motivation 
MINT is based on the hypothesis that news ar-
ticles in different languages with similar content 
contain highly overlapping set of NEs. News 
articles are typically rich in NEs as news is about 
events involving people, locations, organizations, 
etc2. It is reasonable to expect that multilingual 
news articles reporting the same news event 
mention the same NEs in the respective languag-
es. For instance, consider the English and Hindi 
news reports from the New York Times and the 
BBC on the second oath taking of President Ba-
rack Obama (Figure 1). The articles are not pa-
rallel but discuss the same event. Naturally, they 
mention the same NEs (such as Barack Obama, 
John Roberts, White House) in the respective 
languages, and hence, are rich sources of NETEs.    
Our empirical investigation of comparable 
corpora confirmed the above insight. A study of 
                                                 
2 News articles from the BBC corpus had, on an 
average, 12.9 NEs and new articles from the The 
New Indian Express, about 11.8 NEs. 
 
200 pairs of similar news articles published by 
The New Indian Express in 2007 in English and 
Tamil showed that 87% of the single word NEs 
in the English articles had at least one translitera-
tion equivalent in the conjugate Tamil articles.  
The MINT method leverages this empirically 
backed insight to mine NETEs from such compa-
rable corpora.   
However, there are several challenges to the 
mining process: firstly, vast majority of the NEs 
in comparable corpora are very sparse; our anal-
ysis showed that 80% of the NEs in The New 
Indian Express news corpora appear less than 5 
times in the entire corpora.  Hence, any mining 
method that depends mainly on repeated occur-
rences of the NEs in the corpora is likely to miss 
vast majority of the NETEs.  Secondly, the min-
ing method must restrict the candidate NETEs 
that need to be examined for match to a reasona-
bly small number, not only to minimize false 
positives but also to be computationally efficient.  
Thirdly, the use of linguistic tools and resources 
must be kept to a minimum as resources are 
available only in a handful of languages.  Finally, 
it is important to use as little language-specific 
knowledge as possible in order to make the min-
ing method applicable across a vast majority of 
languages of the world.  The MINT method pro-
posed in this paper addresses all the above is-
sues.

3 The MINT Mining Method 
MINT has two stages. In the first stage, for 
every document in the source language side, the 
set of documents in the target language side with 
similar news content are found using a cross-
language document similarity model. In the 
second stage, the NEs in the source language 
side are extracted using a Named Entity Recog-
nizer (NER) and, subsequently, for each NE in a 
source language document, its transliterations are 
mined from the corresponding target language 
documents. We present the details of the two 
stages of MINT in the remainder of this section. 
3.1 Finding Similar Document Pairs  
The first stage of MINT method (Figure 2) works 
on the documents from the comparable corpora 
(CS, CT) in languages S and T and produces a col-
lection AS,T  of similar article pairs (DS, DT).  Each 
article pair (DS, DT) in AS,T consists of an article 
(DS) in language S and an article (DT) in language 
T, that have similar content. The cross-language 
similarity between DS and DT, as measured by the 
cross-language similarity model MD, is at least ? 
> 0. 
 
Cross-language Document Similarity Model: 
The cross-language document similarity model 
measures the degree of similarity between a pair 
of documents in source and target languages.  
We use the negative KL-divergence between 
source and target document probability distribu-
tions as the similarity measure. 
  Given two documents DS, DT in source and tar-
get languages respectively, with 
TS VV , denoting 
the vocabulary of source and target languages, 
the similarity between the two documents is giv-
en by the KL-divergence measure, -KL(DS || DT), 
as: 
?
? TTw ST
TT
ST
V Dwp
DwpDwp )|(
)|(log)|(
  
where p(w | D) is the likelihood of word w in D. 
As we are interested in target documents which 
are similar to a given source document, we can 
ignore the numerator as it is independent of the 
target document.  Finally, expanding p(wT | Ds) 
as 
)|()|( SVw TSS wwpDwpSS??
we specify the 
cross-language similarity score as follows: 
 
Cross-language similarity =       
)|(log)|()|( TTSTw w SS DwpwwpDwpTVT SVS? ?? ?
 
 
3.2 Mining NETEs from Document Pairs  
The second stage of the MINT method works on 
each pair of articles (DS, DT) in the collection AS,T  
and produces a set PS,T of NETEs. Each pair (?S, 
?T) in PS,T  consists of an NE ?S in language S, and 
a token ?T in language T, that are transliteration 
equivalents of each other.  Furthermore, the 
transliteration similarity between ?S and ?T, as 
measured by the transliteration similarity model 
MT, is at least ? > 0. Figure 3 outlines this algo-
rithm.  
 
Discriminative Transliteration Similarity 
Model:  
The transliteration similarity model MT measures 
the degree of transliteration equivalence between 
a source language and a target language term.  
Input: Comparable news corpora (CS, CT) in languages (S,T)  
           Crosslanguage Document Similarity Model MD for (S, T) 
           Threshold score ?. 
Output: Set AS,T of pairs of similar articles (DS, DT) from (CS, CT). 
1 AS,T  ? ? ;         // Set of Similar articles (DS, DT) 
2 for each article DS in CS do 
3     XS   ? ? ;       // Set of candidates for DS. 
4      for each article dT  in CT  do 
5         score = CrossLanguageDocumentSimilarity(DS,dT,MD); 
6         if (score ? ?) then XS  ? XS  ? (dT , score) ; 
7      end 
8     DT  = BestScoringCandidate(XS); 
9    if (DT  ? ?) then AS,T  ? AS,T  ? (DS, DT) ; 
10 end 
CrossLanguageSimilarDocumentPairs

5            for each candidate eT  in DT  do 
6                 score = TransliterationSimilarity(?S, eT, MT) ; 
7                 if (score ? ?)  then   YS  ?  YS ? (eT , score) ; 
8            end 
9            ?T  = BestScoringCandidate(YS) ;  
10          if (?T  ? null) then PS,T  ?  PS,T  ? (?S, ?T) ; 
11      end 
12 end 
TransliterationEquivalents 
Figure 3. Stage 2 of MINT 
801
We employ a logistic function as our translitera-
tion similarity model MT, as follows: 
 
 TransliterationSimilarity (?S,eT,MT) = 
),( TS1
1
ewte ?????
 
where ? (?S, eT) is the feature vector for the pair 
(?S, eT) and w is the weights vector.  Note that the 
transliteration similarity takes a value in the 
range [0..1]. The weights vector w is learnt dis-
criminatively over a training corpus of known 
transliteration equivalents in the given pair of 
languages. 
 
Features: The features employed by the model 
capture interesting cross-language associations 
observed in (?S, eT): 
 
? All unigrams and bigrams from the 
source and target language strings. 
? Pairs of source string n-grams and target 
string n-grams such that difference in the 
start positions of the source and target n-
grams is at most 2. Here n ? ?2,1? . 
? Difference in the lengths of the two 
strings.  
 
Generative Transliteration Similarity Model: 
We also experimented with an extension of He’s 
W-HMM model (He, 2007). The transition prob-
ability depends on both the jump width and the 
previous source character as in the W-HMM 
model. The emission probability depends on the 
current source character and the previous target 
character unlike the W-HMM model (Udupa et 
al., 2009). Instead of using any single alignment 
of characters in the pair (wS, wT), we marginalize 
over all possible alignments: 
? ? ? ? ? ?11
1
11 ,|,|| 1 ??
?
???? jajajj
A
m
j
nm tstpsaapstP
jj
 
 
Here, 
jt
(and resp. 
is ) denotes the j
th (and resp. 
ith) character in wT (and resp. wS) and maA 1? is 
the hidden alignment between wT and wS where 
jt
is aligned to 
jas
, ,m,j ?1? . We estimate 
the parameters of the model using the EM algo-
rithm. The transliteration similarity score of a 
pair (wS, wT) is log P(wT  | wS) appropriately trans-
formed. 
 
 
4 Experimental Setup 
Our empirical investigation consists of experi-
ments in three data environments, with each en-
vironment providing answer to specific set of 
questions, as listed below: 
 
1. Ideal Environment (IDEAL): Given a collec-
tion AS,T of oracle-aligned article pairs (DS, DT) 
in S and T, how effective is Stage 2 of MINT in 
mining NETE from AS,T? 
2. Near Ideal Environment (NEAR-IDEAL): 
Let AS,T  be a collection of similar article pairs 
(DS, DT) in S and T. Given comparable corpora 
(CS, CT) consisting of only articles from AS,T, but 
without the knowledge of pairings between the 
articles,  
a. How effective is Stage 1 of MINT in re-
covering AS,T  from (CS, CT) ? 
b. What is the effect of Stage 1 on the 
overall effectiveness of MINT? 
3. Real Environment (REAL): Given large 
comparable corpora (CS, CT), how effective is 
MINT, end-to-end? 
 
The IDEAL environment is indeed ideal for 
MINT since every article in the comparable cor-
pora is paired with exactly one similar article in 
the other language and the pairing of articles in 
the comparable corpora is known in advance.  
We want to emphasize here that such corpora are 
indeed available in many domains such as tech-
nical documents and interlinked multilingual 
Wikipedia articles. In the IDEAL environment, 
only Stage 2 of MINT is put to test, as article 
alignments are given.  
In the NEAR-IDEAL data environment, every 
article in the comparable corpora is known to 
have exactly one conjugate article in the other 
language though the pairing itself is not known 
in advance.  In such a setting, MINT needs to 
discover the article pairing before mining NETEs 
and therefore, both stages of MINT are put to 
test.  The best performance possible in this envi-
ronment should ideally be the same as that of 
IDEAL, and any degradation points to the short-
coming of the Stage 1 of MINT.  These two en-
vironments quantify the stage-wise performance 
of the MINT method.    
Finally, in the data environment REAL, we 
test MINT on large comparable corpora, where 
even the existence of a conjugate article in the 
target side for a given article in the source side of 
the comparable corpora is not guaranteed, as in 
802
any normal large multilingual news corpora. In 
this scenario both the stages of MINT are put to 
test.  This is the toughest, and perhaps the typical 
setting in which MINT would be used.  
4.1 Comparable Corpora 
In our experiments, the source language is Eng-
lish whereas the 4 target languages are from 
three different language families (Hindi from the 
Indo-Aryan family, Russian from the Slavic fam-
ily, Kannada and Tamil from the Dravidian fami-
ly). Note that none of the five languages use a 
common script and hence identification of cog-
nates, spelling variations, suffix transformations, 
and other techniques commonly used for closely 
related languages that have a common script are 
not applicable for mining NETEs.  Table 1 sum-
marizes the 6 different comparable corpora that 
were used for the empirical investigation; 4 for 
the IDEAL and NEAR-IDEAL environments (in 
4 language pairs), and 2 for the REAL environ-
ment (in 2 language pairs).

Table 1: Comparable Corpora 
 
The corpora can be categorized into two sepa-
rate groups, group S (for Small) consisting of 
EK-S, ET-S, ER-S, and EH-S and group L (for 
Large) consisting of EK-L and ET-L. Corpora in 
group S are relatively small in size, and contain 
pairs of articles that have been judged by human 
annotators as similar. Corpora in group L are two 
orders of magnitude larger in size than those in 
group S and contain a large number of articles 
that may not have conjugates in the target side. 
In addition the pairings are unknown even for the 
articles that have conjugates. All comparable 
corpora had publication dates, except EH-S, 
which is known to have been published over the 
same year. 
The EK-S, ET-S, EK-L and ET-L corpora are 
from The New Indian Express news paper, whe-
reas the EH-S corpora are from Web Dunia and 
the ER-S corpora are from BBC/Lenta News 
Agency respectively. 
4.2 Cross-language Similarity Model  
The cross-language document similarity model 
requires a bilingual dictionary in the appropriate 
language pair. Therefore, we generated statistical 
dictionaries for 3 language pairs (from parallel 
corpora of the following sizes: 11K sentence 
pairs in English-Kannada, 54K in English-Hindi, 
and 14K in English-Tamil) using the GIZA++ 
statistical alignment tool (Och et al., 2003), with 
5 iterations each of IBM Model 1 and HMM.  
We did not have access to an English-Russian 
parallel corpus and hence could not generate a 
dictionary for this language pair. Hence, the 
NEAR-IDEAL experiments were not run for the 
English-Russian language pair.   
Although the coverage of the dictionaries was 
low, this turned out to be not a serious issue for 
our cross-language document similarity model as 
it might have for topic based CLIR (Ballesteros 
and Croft, 1998). Unlike CLIR, where the query 
is typically smaller in length compared to the 
documents, in our case we are dealing with news 
articles of comparable size in both source and 
target languages.  
When many translations were available for a 
source word, we considered only the top-4 trans-
lations.  Further, we smoothed the document 
probability distributions with collection frequen-
cy as described in (Ponte and Croft, 1998). 
4.3 Transliteration Similarity Model  
The transliteration similarity models for each of 
the 4 language pairs were produced by learning 
over a training corpus consisting of about 16,000 
single word NETEs, in each pair of languages.  
The training corpus in English-Hindi, English-
Kannada and English-Tamil were hand-crafted 
by professionals, the English-Russian name pairs 
were culled from Wikipedia interwiki links and 
were cleaned heuristically.  Equal number of 
negative samples was used for training the mod-
els. To produce the negative samples, we paired 
each source language NE with a random non-
matching target language NE.  No language spe-
cific features were used and the same feature set 
was used in each of the 4 language pairs making 
MINT language neutral.   
In all the experiments, our source side lan-
guage is English, and the Stanford Named Entity 
Recognizer (Finkel et al, 2005) was used to ex-
tract NEs from the source side article.  It should 
be noted here that while the precision of the NER 
803
used was consistently high, its recall was low, 
(~40%) especially in the New Indian Express 
corpus, perhaps due to the differences in the data 
used for training the NER and the data on which 
we used it.   
4.4 Performance Measures  
Our intention is to measure the effectiveness of 
MINT by comparing its performance with the 
oracular (human annotator) performance.  As 
transliteration equivalents must exist in the 
paired articles to be found by MINT, we focus 
only on those NEs that actually have at least one 
transliteration equivalent in the conjugate article. 
Three performance measures are of interest to 
us: the fraction of distinct NEs from source lan-
guage for which we found at least one translitera-
tion in the target side (Recall on distinct NEs), 
the fraction of distinct NETEs (Recall on distinct 
NETEs) and the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) 
of the NETEs mined.  Since we are interested in 
mining not only the highly frequent but also the 
infrequent NETEs, recall metrics measure how 
effective our method is in mining NETEs ex-
haustively. The MRR score indicates how effec-
tive our method is in preferring the correct ones 
among candidates. 
To measure the performance of MINT, we 
created a test bed for each of the language pairs. 
The test beds are summarized in Table 2.  
The test beds consist of pairs of similar ar-
ticles in each of the language pairs. It should be 
noted here that as transliteration equivalents must 
exist in the paired articles to be found by MINT, 
we focus only on those NEs that actually have at 
least one transliteration equivalent in the conju-
gate article. 
5 Results & Analysis 
In this section, we present qualitative and quan-
titative performance of the MINT algorithm, in 
mining NETEs from comparable news corpora. 
All the results in Sections 5.1 to 5.3 were ob-
tained using the discriminative transliteration 
similarity model described in Section 3.2. The 
results using the generative transliteration simi-
larity model are discussed in Section 5.4. 
5.1 IDEAL Environment 
Our first set of experiments investigated the ef-
fectiveness of Stage 2 of MINT, namely the min-
ing of NETEs in an IDEAL environment. As 
MINT is provided with paired articles in this ex-
periment, all experiments for this environment 
were run on test beds created from group S cor-
pora (Table 2).  
 
 
Results in the IDEAL Environment:  
The recall measures for distinct NEs and distinct 
NETEs for the IDEAL environment are reported 
in Table 3.

ER-ST 93.33 85.88 
 Table 3: Recall of MINT in IDEAL 
 
Note that in the first 3 language pairs MINT was 
able to mine a transliteration equivalent for al-
most all the distinct NEs. The performance in 
English-Russian pair was relatively worse, per-
haps due to the noisy training data.   
In order to compare the effectiveness of 
MINT with a state-of-the-art NETE mining ap-
proach, we implemented the time series based 
Co-Ranking algorithm based on (Klementiev and 
Roth, 2006).  
 
Table 4 shows the MRR results in the IDEAL 
environment – both for MINT and the Co-
Ranking baseline: MINT outperformed Co-
Ranking on all the language pairs, despite not 
using time series similarity in the mining 
process.  The high MRRs (@1 and @5) indicate 
that in almost all the cases, the top-ranked candi-
date is a correct NETE.  Note that Co-Ranking 
could not be run on the EH-ST test bed as the 
articles did not have a date stamp. Co-Ranking is 
crucially dependent on time series and hence re-
quires date stamps for the articles.

5.2 NEAR-IDEAL Environment 
The second set of experiments investigated the 
effectiveness of Stage 1 of MINT on comparable 
corpora that are constituted by pairs of similar 
articles, where the pairing information between 
the articles is with-held.  MINT reconstructed the 
pairings using the cross-language document si-
milarity model and subsequently mined NETEs. 
As in previous experiments, we ran our experi-
ments on test beds described in Section 4.4. 
 
Results in the NEAR-IDEAL Environment: 
There are two parts to this set of experiments. In 
the first part, we investigated the effectiveness of 
the cross-language document similarity model 
described in Section 3.1. Since we know the 
identity of the conjugate article for every article 
in the test bed, and articles can be ranked accord-
ing to the cross-language document similarity 
score, we simply computed the MRR for the 
documents identified in each of the test beds, 
considering only the top-2 results. Further, where 
available, we made use of the publication date of 
articles to restrict the number of target articles 
that are considered in lines 4 and 5 of the MINT 
algorithm in Figure 2.  Table 5 shows the results 
for two date windows – 3 days and 1 year.

EH-ST - 0.81 - 0.82 
Table 5: MRR of Stage 1 in NEAR-IDEAL 
 
Subsequently, the output of the Stage 1 was giv-
en as the input to the Stage 2 of the MINT me-
thod. In Table 6 we report the MRR @1 and @5 
for the second stage, for both time windows (3 
days & 1 year). 
 
It is interesting to compare the results of MINT 
in NEAR-IDEAL data environment (Table 6) 
with MINT’s results in IDEAL environment 
(Table 4). The drop in MRR@1 is small: ~2% 
for EK-ST and ~3% for ET-ST. For EH-ST the 
drop is relatively more (~12%) as may be ex-
pected since the time window (3 days) could not 
be applied for this test bed.  
5.3 REAL Environment 
The third set of experiments investigated the ef-
fectiveness of MINT on large comparable corpo-
ra. We ran the experiments on test beds created 
from group L corpora.   
 
 Test-beds for the REAL Environment: The 
test beds for the REAL environment (Table 7) 
consisted of only English articles since we do not 
know in advance whether these articles have any 
similar articles in the target languages. 
 
 Results in the REAL Environment: In real 
environment, we examined the top 2 articles of 
returned by Stage 1 of MINT, and mined NETEs 
from them. We used a date window of 3 in Stage 
1. Table 8 summarizes the results for the REAL 
environment. 
 
We observe that the performance of MINT is 
impressive, considering the fact that the compa-
rable corpora used in the REAL environment is 
two orders of magnitude larger than those used in 
IDEAL and NEAR-IDEAL environments. This 
implies that MINT is able to effectively mine 
NETEs whenever the Stage 1 algorithm was able 
to find a good conjugate for each of the source 
language articles.  
5.4 Generative Transliteration Similarity 
Model 
We employed the extended W-HMM translitera-
tion similarity model in MINT and used it in the 
IDEAL data environment.  Table 9 shows the 
results.

tive transliteration similarity model

We see that the results for the generative transli-
teration similarity model are good but not as 
good as those for the discriminative translitera-
tion similarity model. As we did not stem either 
the English NEs or the target language words, 
the generative model made more mistakes on 
inflected words compared to the discriminative 
model.   
5.5  Examples of Mined NETEs 
Table 10 gives some examples of the NETEs 
mined from the comparable news corpora.  
 
6  Related Work 
CLIR systems have been studied in several 
works (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998; Kraiij et al, 
2003). The limited coverage of dictionaries has 
been recognized as a problem in CLIR and MT 
(Demner-Fushman & Oard, 2002; Mandl & 
Womser-hacker, 2005; Xu &Weischedel, 2005).  
In order to address this problem, different 
kinds of approaches have been taken, from learn-
ing transformation rules from dictionaries and 
applying the rules to find cross-lingual spelling 
variants (Pirkola et al., 2003), to  learning trans-
lation lexicon from monolingual and/or compa-
rable corpora (Fung, 1995; Al-Onaizan and 
Knight, 2002; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 
1996). While these works have focused on find-
ing translation equivalents of all class of words, 
we focus specifically on transliteration equiva-
lents of NEs.  (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; 
Quirk et al., 2007) addresses mining of parallel 
sentences and fragments from nearly parallel 
sentences. In contrast, our approach mines 
NETEs from article pairs that may not even have 
any parallel or nearly parallel sentences.   
NETE discovery from comparable corpora 
using time series and transliteration model was 
proposed in (Klementiev and Roth, 2006), and 
extended for NETE mining for several languages 
in (Saravanan and Kumaran, 2007).  However, 
such methods miss vast majority of the NETEs 
due to their dependency on frequency signatures.   
In addition, (Klementiev and Roth, 2006) may 
not scale for large corpora, as they examine 
every word in the target side as a potential trans-
literation equivalent. NETE mining from compa-
rable corpora using phonetic mappings was pro-
posed in (Tao et al., 2006), but the need for lan-
guage specific knowledge restricts its applicabili-
ty across languages.  We proposed the idea of 
mining NETEs from multilingual articles with 
similar content in (Udupa, et al., 2008). In this 
work, we extend the approach and provide a de-
tailed description of the empirical studies. 
7  Conclusion 
In this paper, we showed that MINT, a simple 
and intuitive technique employing cross-
language document similarity and transliteration 
similarity models, is capable of mining NETEs 
effectively from large comparable news corpora. 
Our three stage empirical investigation showed 
that MINT performed close to optimal on com-
parable corpora consisting of pairs of similar ar-
ticles when the pairings are known in advance. 
MINT induced fairly good pairings and performs 
exceedingly well even when the pairings are not 
known in advance. Further, MINT outperformed 
a state-of-the-art baseline and scaled to large 
comparable corpora.  Finally, we demonstrated 
the language neutrality of MINT, by mining 
NETEs from 4 language pairs (between English 
and one of Russian, Hindi, Kannada or Tamil) 
from 3 vastly different linguistic families. 
As a future work, we plan to use the ex-
tended W-HMM model to get features for the 
discriminative transliteration similarity model. 
We also want to use a combination of the cross-
language document similarity score and the 
transliteration similarity score for scoring the 
NETEs. Finally, we would like to use the mined 
NETEs to improve the performance of the first 
stage of MINT.
