Regular languages correspond exactly .to those languages that can be recognized by 
a finite-state automaton. Add a stack to that automaton, and one obtains the context- 
free languages, and so on. Probably all of us learned at some point in our univer- 
sity studies about the Chomsky hierarchy of formal languages and the duality be- 
tween the form of their rewriting systems and the automata or computational re- 
sources necessary to recognize them. What is perhaps less well known is that yet 
another way of characterizing formal languages i provided by mathematical logic, 
namely in terms of the kind and number of variables, quantifiers, and operators 
that a logical language requires in order to define another formal language. This 
mode of characterization, which is subsumed by an area of research called descrip- 
tive complexity theory, is at once more declarative than an automaton or rewriting 
system, more flexible in terms of the primitive relations or concepts that it can pro- 
vide resort to, and less wedded to the tacit, not at all unproblematic, assumption 
that the right way to view any language, including natural anguage, is as a set of 
strings. 
This book is a collection of recent papers that pursue the connection between log- 
ical and natural languages further, mainly with regard to monadic second-order logic 
(MSO). Their relevance is apparent in the light of three earlier results. The first is the 
considerable amount of previous work in formal anguage theory on "tree languages." 
Given the extent o which trees and concepts based on tree position are used to ex- 
press linguistic regularities, it is natural to think of using trees rather than strings as 
the basic elements of a formal anguage. It is also known that the tree languages de- 
finable in MSO are precisely those whose yields are the context-free string languages. 
The second is Rogers's landmark thesis (Rogers 1994), which demonstrated that sig- 
nificant portions of Government-and-Binding Theory (GB) can be very transparently 
expressed in MSO. The third is a collection of evidence from Dutch and Swiss Ger- 
man (Huybregts 1976, 1984; Shieber 1985) for the non-context-freeness of at least some 
natural anguages. Thus, while MSO may be a very elegant choice, it does not quite 
appear to be a sufficient choice. 
While no clear answer to this dilemma presents itself here, several of the chapters 
in this volume do address this issue directly. Rogers shows that dropping the usual 
requirement of bounded branching on trees leads to the same expressive power as 
infinite context-free grammars that are finitely presentable as regular expressions of 
context-free rules. These can be used in certain accounts of coordination. Morawietz 
shows how MSO can be thought of as a constraint language and thereby incorpo- 
rated into a constraint logic programming language, which can then generate any

computable language. M6nnich demonstrates how to use a kind of "macro grammar" 
to define tree languages in MSO for the non-context-free phenomena that one can 
find in natural languages by replacing the normal substitution process that rewrit- 
ing systems assume in their notion of derivation by a higher-order variant in which 
operations uch as composition can be explicitly represented as objects in the macro 
language. 
Other chapters approach tree description from different perspectives. Kallmeyer 
presents a tree description language that allows for true underspecification f domi- 
nance relations rather than just their path lengths. Kracht generalizes trees to handle 
some of the thorny formal issues surrounding the use of "categories," complexes of 
possibly several tree nodes that play a significant role in Chomsky's Barriers the- 
ory. There are also two chapters (by Kolb and Cornell) that discuss the application 
of declarative approaches to tree description to Chomsky's much more derivation- 
based Minimalist Program. In overall content, the book offers a very pleasing bal- 
ance between formal rigor and linguistic application and a very well-informed set of 
references. 
To say the least, this is not a book for the mathematically faint of heart. It must 
be said, however, that the editors and authors have managed to organize the book 
so that it is remarkably self-contained on the formal side. The only notable exception 
is the paper by Palm on a first-order alternative for formulating linguistic principles, 
which relies too heavily on a report published elsewhere to address the numerous 
counterexamples and exceptions to the near-theorems it presents. Otherwise, the pre- 
sumed familiarity with the Minimalist Program in the later chapters may actually pose 
a greater barrier to comprehension by likely readers who fall outside the book's in- 
tended audience, i.e., researchers and graduate students in linguistics with a strong 
background in logic. The book also suffers from a rather large number of grammatical 
and typographical errors, including several in formal definitions, which makes the 
reading difficult in places. 
Another slight problem, which is really a more systemic one in mathematical 
linguistics, is that no direct attempt is made to address other trends in generative 
linguistics that have a bearing on the subject under formal consideration. The use 
of parallel, yet very different levels of syntactic representation, such as in Lexical- 
Functional Grammar (LFG), or of more than one kind of constituent, as in the Prague 
school of linguistics, leaves open the possibility of using MSO to formulate constraints 
on multiple representations that, when intersected or otherwise combined, may pro- 
duce very elegant analyses of non-context-free phenomena. There is also an established 
precedent in computer science of using MSO on richer graph-based languages than 
tree languages (Courcelle 1988; Engelfriet 1991), which might make MSO a realistic 
option for formalizing principles over feature-structure-based theories of language in 
a more constrained fashion. A courteous attempt is, in fact, made to relate the im- 
portance of this research to schools of linguistic thought other than GB/Minimalism, 
e.g., to LFG or Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, but for the most part these 
are throw-away remarks or outright misrepresentations. 
The Mathematics of Syntactic Structure is, nevertheless, a faithful representation of
the state of the art in this area, and can be recommended asa useful primer for com- 
putational linguists on descriptive complexity theory and its applications to linguistic 
theory.
