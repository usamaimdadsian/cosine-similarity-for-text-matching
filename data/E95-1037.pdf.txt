Abstract 
This paper proposes a corpus-based language 
model for topic identification. We analyze 
the association of noun-noun and noun-verb 
pairs in LOB Corpus. The word association 
norms are based on three factors: 1) word 
importance, 2) pair co-occurrence, and 3) 
distance. They are trained on the paragraph 
and sentence l vels for noun-noun and noun- 
verb pairs, respectively. Under the topic 
coherence postulation, the nouns that have 
the strongest connectivities with the other 
nouns and verbs in the discourse form the 
preferred topic set. The collocational 
semantics then is used to identify the topics 
from paragraphs and to discuss the topic 
shift phenomenon among paragraphs. 
1 Introduction 
Although only speakers and writers instead of texts 
have topics (Brown and Yule, 1983, p. 68), natural 
language researchers always want to identify a topic 
or a set of possible topics from a discourse for further 
applications, such as anaphora resolution, 
information retrieval and so on. This paper adopts a 
corpus-based approach to process discourse 
information. We postulate that: 
(1) Topic is coherent and has strong relation- 
ships with the events in the discourse. 
Now, consider the following example quoted from 
the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus 
(Johansson, 1986). The topics in this example are 
"problem" and "dislocation". The two words are 
more strongly related to the verbs ("explain", "fell", 
"placing" and "suppose") and nouns ("theories", 
"explanations", roll", "codex", "disorder", "order", 
"disturbance" and "upheaval"). 
There is a whole group of theories which 
attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth 
Gospel by explanations based on assumed 
textual dislocations. The present state of the 
Gospel is the result of an accident-prone 
history. The original was written on a roll, or 
codex, which fell into disorder or was 
accidentally damaged. An editor, who was not 
the author, made what he could of the chaos by 
placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in 
order. Most of those who expound a theory of 
textual dislocation take it for granted that the 
Gospel was written entirely by one author 
before the disturbance took place but a few 
leave it open to suppose that the original book 
had been revised even before the upheaval. 
We also postulate that 
(2) Noun-verb is a predicate-argument relation- 
ship on the sentence level and noun-noun 
relationship is associated on discourse level. 
The postulation (2) could be also observed from the 
above example. These relationships may be 
represented implicitly by collocational semantics. 
Collocation has been applied successfully to many 
possible applications (Church et al. , 1989), e.g, 
lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), information 
retrieval (Salton, 1986a), text input (Yamashina nd 
Obashi, 1988), etc. This paper will touch on its 
feasibility in topic identification. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents a corpus-based language model and discuss 
how to train this model. Section 3 touches on topic 
identification i discourse. Section 4 shows a series 
of experiments based on the proposed model and 
discusses the results. Section 5 gives short remarks. 
2 A Language Model 
Brown and Yue (1983) pointed out there are two 
kinds of topics: one is sentence topic and the other is 
discourse topic. The discourse topic is usually the 
form of topic sentence. We postulate, further, that 
the noun in the topic sentence play important roles in 
the whole discourse. Thus nouns play the core part 
in the underlying language model. The associations 
of a noun with other nouns and verbs are supporting 
factors for it to be a topic. 
267 
The importance of a specific verb or noun is 
defined by Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) 
(Salton, 1986b): 
IDF(W) = log((P - O(W)) / O(W)) + c (1) 
where P is the number of documents in LOB Corpus, 
i.e. 500, O(I4/) is the number of documents with word 
W, and c is a threshold value. LOB Corpus is a 
million-word collection of present-day British 
English texts. It contains 500 texts of approximately 
2,000 words distributed over 15 text categories 
(Johansson, 1986). These categories include 
reportage, editorial, reviews, religion, skills, trades, 
popular lore, belles lettres, biography, essays, learned 
and scientific writings, fictions, humour, adventure 
and western fiction, love story, etc. That is to say, 
LOB Corpus is a balanced corpus. The tag set of 
LOB Corpus is based on the philosophy of that of 
Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979), but some 
modifications are made. This is to achieve greater 
delicacy, while preserving comparability with the 
Brown Corpus. 
Those words that appear more than one haft of 
the documents in LOB Corpus have negative log((P- 
. O(W))/O(W)) shown below. 
Noun: 
Verb: 
time(-3.68) way(-1.92) year(-1.71) 
man(-1.47) day(-1.12) part(-0.76) 
people(-0.75) thing(-0.73) hand(-0.54) 
life(-0.51) fact(-0.40) place(-0.40) 
work(-0.35) end(-0.12) case(-0.09) 
point(-0.05) 
make(-5.01) take(-3.56) give(-2.95) 
come(-2.45) find(-2.30) see(-2.26) 
know(-2.20) say(-2.18) go(-2.11)

1ook(-0.48) call(-0.43) tell(-0.41) 
keep(-0.32) hold(-0.18) ask(-0.23) 
begin(-0.08) 
The threshold values for nouns and verbs are set to 
0.77 and 2.46 respectively. The two values are used 
to screen out the unimportant words, whose 1DF 
values are negative. That is, their 1DF values are 
reset to zero. The strength of one occurrence of a 
verb-noun pair or a noun-noun pair is computed by 
the importance of the words and their distances: 
SNV(N~,~) =IDF(N~).IDF(V~)I D(N~,Vj) (2) 
SNN(N~, Nk) = IDF(N~).IDF(Nk) / D(N~, Nk) (3) 
where SNV denotes the strength of a noun-verb pair, 
SNN the strength of a noun-noun pair, and D(X,Y) 
represents the distance between X and Y. When i 
equals to k, the SNN(Ni,Nk) is set to zero. Including 
the distance factor is motivated by the fact that the 
related events are usually located in the same 
texthood. This is the spatial ocality of events in a 
discourse. 
The distance is measured by the difference 
between cardinal numbers of two words. We assign 
a cardinal number to each verb and noun in 
sentences. The cardinal numbers are kept 
continuous across sentences in the same paragraph. 
For example, 
With so many problems 1 to solve2, it would 
be a great helP3 to select 4 some one problem 5 
which might be the key 6 to all the others, and 
begin 7 there. If there is any such key- 
problem 8,then it is undoubtedly the problem 9 
of the unitYlo of the Gospelll. There are 
three viewsl2 of the Fourth Gospell3 which 
have been held14. 
Therefore, the cardinal number of problems, 
C(problems), equals to 1 and C(held) is 14. The 
distance can be defined to be 
D(Z,Y) = abs( C(X)-C( Y) ) (4) 
The association orms of verb-noun and noun-noun 
pairs are summation of the strengths of all their 
occurrences in the corpus: 
ANV(Nj, V~) = Z SNV(Ni' Vs) (5) 
ANN(Ni, N k) = Z SNN(N~, N k ) (6) 
where ANV denotes the association orm of a noun- 
verb pair, and ANN the association orm of a noun- 
noun pair. The less frequent word has a higher IDF 
value so that the strength SNV and SNN of one 
occurrence may be larger. However, the number of 
terms to be summed is smaller. Thus, the formulae 
IDF and ANV (ANN) are complementary. LOB 
Corpus of approximately one million words is used 
to train the basic association orms. They are based 
on different levels: the paragraph and sentence l vels 
for noun-noun and noun-verb pairs respectively. 
Table 1 shows the statistics of the training corpus. 
The words with tags NC, NNU and NNUS and Ditto 
tags are not considered. Here NC means cited words, 
and NNU (NNUS) denotes abbreviated (plural) unit 
of measurement unmarked for number. Ditto tags 
are those words whose senses in combination differ 
from the role of the same words in other context. 
For example, "as to", "each other", and "so as to" 
(Johansson, 1986).

Under the topic coherence postulation in a 
paragraph, we compute the connectivities of the 
nouns in each sentence with the verbs and nouns in 
the paragraph. For example, 439 verbs in LOB 
Corpus have relationships with the word "problem" 
in different degrees. Some of them are listed below 
in descending order by the strength. 
solve(225.21), face(84.64) ..... specify(16.55) ..... 
explain(6.47), ..., fal1(2.52) ..... suppose(1.67) ....
For the example in Section 1, the word "problem" 
and "dislocation" are coherent with the verbs and 
nouns in the discourse. The nouns with the strongest 
connectivity form the preferred topic set. Consider 
the interference effects. The constituents far apart 
have less relationship. Distance D(X,Y) is used to 
measure such effects. Assume there are m nouns and 
n verbs in a paragraph. The connective strength of a 
noun Ni (1 < i < m) is defined to be: 
CSNN(N~) = Z (ANN(N,  N k) / D(Ni, Ark) (7) 
k 
CSNV(N~) = Z (ANN(N~, V k) / D(N,, V k)) (8) 
k 
CS(N~) = (PN. CSNN(N,) + PV. CSNV(N~)) / c (9) 
where CS denotes the connective strength, and PAr 
and PV are parameters for CSNN and CSNV and 
PN+PV=I. 
The determination of par and PV is via deleted 
interpolation (Jelinek, 1985). Using equation PN + 
PV = 1 and equation 9, we could derive PAr and PV 
as equation 10 and equation 11 show. 
CS-  CSNV 
PN = (10) 
CSNN - CSNV 
CS - CSNN 
PV - (11) 
CSNV - CSNN 
LOB corpus are separated into two parts whose 
volume ratio is 3:1. Both PN and PV are initialized 
to 0.5 and then are trained by using the 3/4 corpus. 
Alter the first set of parameters i generated, the 
remain 1/4 LOB corpus is run until par and PV 
converge using equations 9, 10 and 11. Finally, the 
parameters, PN and PV, converge to 0.675844 and 
0.324156 respectively. 
3 Topic Identification in a Paragraph 
The test data are selected from the first text of the 
files LOBT-DI, LOBT-F1, LOBT-G1, LOBT-H1, 
LOBT-KI, LOBT-M1 and LOBT-N1 of horizontal 
version of LOB Tagged Corpus for inside test 
(hereafter, we will use D01, F01, G01, H01, K01, 
M01, and N01 to represent these texts respectively). 
Category D denotes religion, Category F denotes 
popular lore, Category G denotes belles lettres, 
biography and essays, Category H denotes 
Miscellaneous texts, Category K denotes general 
fiction, Category M denotes science fiction, and 
Category N denotes adventure and western fiction. 
Each paragraph has predetermined topics (called 
assumed topics) which are determined by a linguist. 
Because a noun with basic form N may appear more 
than once in the paragraph, say k times, its strength 
is normalized by the following recursive formula: 
NCS( N m) ) = CS( N o(~) ) (12) 
NCS( No(o) = NCS( No(,_,) + 
(1 - NCS(No(,_,))).CS(No(o) (13) 
where NCS represents the net connective strength, 
o(k) denotes the cardinal number of the k'th 
occurrence of the same N such that C(NoO)) < 
C(No(2)) < C(No(3)) <... < C(No(k-l)) < C(No(k)). 
The possible topic N* has the high probability 
NCS(N*). Here, a topic set whose members are the 
first 20% of the candidates is formed. The 
performance an be measured as the Table 2 shows. 
4 The Preliminary Experimental Results 
According to the language model mentioned in 
Section 2, we build the ANN and ANV values for 
each noun-noun pair and noun-verb pair. Then, we 
apply recursive formula of NCS shown in equations 
12 and 13 to identifying the topic set for test texts. 
Table 3 shows experimental results. Symbols tx and 
c denotes mean and standard eviation. (+) denotes 
correct number, (-) denotes error number and (?) 
denotes undecidable number in topic identification. 
The undecidable case is that the assumed topic is a 
pronoun. Figure 1 shows correct rate, error rate, and 
undecidable rate. 
Row (1) in Table 3 shows the difficulty in finding 
topics from many candidates. In general, there are 
more than 20 candidates in a paragraph, It is 
impossible to select opics at random. Row (2) gives 
269  
the rank of assumed topic. The assumed topics are 
assigned by a linguist. Comparing row (1) and row 
(2), the average number of candidates are much 
larger than the rank of assumed topic. Since it is 
impossible to randomly select candidates as topics, 
we know topic identification isvaluable. 
Rows (3), (4) and (5) list the frequencies of
candidates, assumed topics and computed topic. The 
results intensify the viewpoint that the repeated 
words make persons impressive, and these words are 
likely to be topics. Our topic identification 
algorithm demonstrates the similar behavior (see 
rows (4) and (5)). The average frequencies of 
assumed topics and computed topics are close and 
both of them are larger than average frequency of 
candidates. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates this point. 
Row (6) reflects an interesting phenomenon. The 
topic shifted by authors from paragraph to paragraph 
is demonstrated through comparison of data shown 
in this row and row (2). The rank value of previous 
topics do obviously increase. Recall that large rank 
value denotes low rank.

5 Conc lud ing  Remarks  
Discourse analysis is a very difficult problem in 
natural anguage processing. This paper proposes a
corpus-based language model to tackle topi.c 
identification. The word association norms of noun- 
noun pairs and noun-verb pairs which model the 
meanings of texts are based on three factors: 1) word 
importance, 2) pair occurrence, and 3) distance. The 
nouns that have the stronger connectivities with 
other nouns and verbs in a discourse could form a 
preferred topic set. Inside test of this proposed 
algorithm shows 61.07% correct rate (80 of 131 
paragraphs). 
Besides topic identification, the algorithm could 
detect topic shift phenomenon. The meaning 
transition from paragraph to paragraph could be 
detected by the following way. The connective 
strengths of the topics in the previous paragraph 
with the nouns and the verbs in the current 
paragraph are computed, and compared with the 
topics in the current paragraph. As our experiments 
show, the previous topics have the tendency to 
decrease their strengths in the current paragraph.
