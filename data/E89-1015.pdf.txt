Abstract 
In this paper we discuss an algorithm 
for the assignment of pitch accent positions 
in text-to-speech conversion. The algorithm is 
closely modeled on current linoulstic accounts 
of accent placement, and assumes a surface 
syntactic analysis of the input. It comprises a 
small number of heuristic rules for determining 
which phrases of a sentence are to be focussed 
upon; the exact location of a pitch accent 
within a focussed phrase is determined m~inly 
on the basis of the syntactic relations holding 
between the elements of the phrase. A 
perceptual evaluation experiment showed that 
the algorithm proposed here leads to improved 
subjective speech quality as compared to a 
naive algorithm which accents all and only 
content words. 
1. Introduction 
This paper deals with the prosodic com- 
ponent of a text-to-speech system for Dutch, 
more in particular with the rules for assign- 
ing pitch accents (sentence accents) to words 
in an input sentence. Whereas other work on 
accent rules for Dutch speech synthesis 
(Kager & Quen6, 1987) did not assume a 
syntactically analysed input, I will here work 
from the assumption that the text-to-speech 
system has a large dictionary as well as a 
syntactic parser at its disposal. 
The paper is organized as follows: in 
section 2 I shortly introduce the notions 
focus and (pitch) accent as I will be using 
them; as my framework, I will choose the 
Eindhoven model of Dutch intonation Ct Hart 
& Cohen, 1973; 't Hart & Collier, 1975) in 
conjunction with Gussenhoven's (1983) accent 
placement heory. In section 3 I discuss the 
rules that connect a domain of focus to an 
accent on a particular word. The assi~mment 
of focus domMn~ is dealt with in section 4. 
At the end of this section I s-mrn~O my 
proposals in the form of an accent assignment 
algorithm~ In section 5 I present some results 
obtained in a perceptual evaluation of this al- 
gorithm. 
2. A two-stage model of accent placement 
Work on Dutch intonation at the In- 
stitute for Perception Research (IPO) in 
Eindhoven has resulted in an inventory of 
elementary pitch movements that make up the 
occurring Dutch intonation contours ('t Hart 
& Cohen, 1973; 't Hart & Comer, 1975). The 
phonet ic  character ist ics  of these pitch 
movements are known precisely, and this 
knowledge can be used in the synthesis of 
natural-sounding Dutch intonation contours. 
It was found that some of these elementary 
pitch movements cause the syllable on which 
they are executed to be perceived as ac- 
cented. I will use the term pitch accent or 
simply accent to refer to prominence caused 
by the presence of such an accent-lending 
pitch movement. Of course, the intonation 
model does not predict where in a sentence 
pitch accents or intonational boundaries will 
be located, but when these locations are 
provided as input, the model is capable of 
generating a natural-sounding contour. In the 
remainder of this paper I will deal specifically 
with pitch accent assiLmment. 
It is relatively standard nowadays to 
view accent phcement as a process involving 
two stages (of. Ladd, 1980; Gussenhoven, 1983; 
Fuchs, 1984; Baart, 1987): in the first stage it 
is decided which constituents of a sentence 
contain relatively important information (e.g. 
because they add new information to the back- 
ground shared by speaker and hearer) and are 
therefore to be focussed upon; the decision to 
focus certain parts of a sentence and not 
focus other parts is based on semantico- 
pragmatic information and in principle cannot 
be pred ic ted  f rom the lexico-syntact ic  
structure of a sentence. In the second stage, 
the exact location of a pitch accent within a 
focussed constituent is determined;  here 
lexico-syntactic structure does play a crucial 
role. The following example, cited from Ladd 
(1980), i l lustrates these ideas. ( In the 
examples, pitch accent is indicated by means 
of capitaliT~tion.) 
- I I I -  
(1) even a nineteenth century professor of 
CLASSICS wouldn't have allowed himself 
to be so pedantic 
In this case, it is probably the speaker's 
intention to focus on the subject NP; we can 
say that all the material from a to classics is 
\[ +focus\], while the rest of the sentence is \[- 
focus\]. Given the speaker's decision to focus 
on the subject, an accent is placed by rule on 
the last lexical element within this constituent. 
In the following sections, I first discuss 
the rules that place an accent within a 
focussed constituent in Dutch, and next turn 
to the problem of assigning focus to the 
constituents ofa sentence. 
3. From focus to accent 
As will be clear from the paragraphs 
above, I assume that accent placement is 
predictable if the focussing structure of a 
sentence is known (for discussion see Gussen- 
hoven et al., 1987; Baart, 1987). I adopt 
Gussenhoven's (1983) idea that accent place- 
ment is sensitive to the argument structure of 
a sentence; however, I replace his semantic 
orientation by a syntactic one and apply the 
term argument to any constituent which is 
selected by the subcategorization frame of 
some lexical head, indudln~ subjects. 
Input to the accent rules is a binary 
branching syntactic constituent ree, where 
apart from syntactic category a node is 
provided with information concerning its 
argument status (either argument or not an 
argument of some lexical head), and where 
nodes dominating a focussed constituent are 
assigned the feature \[+focus\], while nodes 
dominating unfocussed material are \[-focus\]. 
In order to arrive at an accentuation pattern, 
three rules and a well-formedness condition 
are to be applied to this input. A first rule 
(see (2)) applies iteratively to pairs of sister 
nodes in the input tree, replacing the syntactic 
labels with the labels s (for 'strong') or w (for 
'weak'), familiar from metrical phonology. By 
convention, whenever a node is labelled s its 
sister has to be labelled w and vice versa, 
the labellings \[s s\] and \[w w\] being excluded 
for pairs of sister nodes. 
(2) Basic Labelling Rule (BLR): 
A pair of sister nodes \[A B\] is labelled 
\[s w\] iff A is an argument; otherwise the 
labelling is \[w s\]. 
The funct ion of the w/s-labell ing is to 
indicate which element of a phrase will bear 
the accent when the phrase is in focus: after 
the application of focus assicmment and w/s- 
labelling rules, an accent will be assigned to 
every terminal that is connected to a domin- 
ating \[ + focus\] node by a path that consists ex- 
clnsively of s-nodes. 
In (3) I illustrate the operation of the 
BLR. All left-hand sisters in (3) are labelled w, 
except for the NP een mooi boek, which is an 
argument. Granted a focus on the predicate, 
accent will be assigned to the element boek 
(there is a path from boek to the \[+focus\] 
node that consists of s-nodes only). 
(3) (ik) heb een mooi BOEK gekocht 
I have a nice book bought 
~ s 
heb ....L.. ~ "  w 
w s gek~cht 
oen W S 
$ . t 
moot boek 
The output of the BLR may be modified 
by two additional rules. First, the Rhythm Rule 
accounts for cases of rhythmical accent shift, 
see  (4) .  
(4) Rhythm Rule (RR, applies to the output 
of the BLR): 
A w....~ s W S 
"'" C ~ "'" C 
w-'h 
A B A B 
Conditions: 
(a) C is dominated by a focus 
Co) B and C are string-adjacent 
(c) A is not a pronoun, article, ~ prepos- 
ition or conjunction 
In (5), where we assume focus on both the 
main verb and the time adverbial, the accent 
pattern on the adverbial has been modified by 
the 1111 (the accent which is normally reali7egi 
on nacht has been shifted to hele). 
- 112-  
(5) (hij heeft) de HELE nacht GELEZEN 
he has the whole niEht read 
w ~ s  
\[+focus\] \[+focus\] 
W ~ S gelezen ('"w 
hele nacht 
Until now, nothing prevents the label s 
from being assigned to a node which is \[- 
focus\]. The following rule, adopted from Ladd 
(1980) takes care of this case. The rule makes 
sure that a \[-focus\] node is labelled w; by 
convention, its sister node becomes s.
(6) Default Accent (DA): 
s - -P  w 
\[-focus\] 
While arguments are normally labelled s and 
therefore likely to receive accent, there are 
some cases where we do not want an argument 
to be accented. A case in point are \[-focus\] 
pronouns. In (Ta) we have an example of a 
lexical object NP (een speld); in (7b) thi~ NP 
is replaced by a \[-focus\] pronoun (lets). As a 
result of the DA rule, it is the particle (op) 
that receives the accent in (Tb), instead of the 
object.  
(7a) (hij raapt) een SPELD op 
he picks a pin up 
\[ + focus\] 
s w 
w~'s  op 
' p~ld een S 
Co) (hij raapt) iets OP 
he picks something up 
\[ + focus\] 
, . o  
W S 
! \[-fo,cus\] op 
iets 
In addition to the rules presented thus 
far, a well-formedness condition is necessary 
in order to account for the focus-accent 
relation. It has been noted by Gussenhoven 
(1983) that an unaccented verb may not be 
part of a focus domain if it is directly 
preceded by an accented adjunct. For in- 
stance, in (8a) 
(8a) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK verwoest 
in Zeist is a factory destroyed 
the verb (verwoest) is unaccented. There is 
no problem here: the VP as a whole is in 
focus, due to the accent on the argument een 
fabdek. Consider, however, (Sb): 
(Sb) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRAND 
verwoest 
in Zeist is a factory by fire 
destroyed 
This is a somewhat strange sentence. The 
accent on door BRAND arouses an impression 
of contrast and the verb vetwoest is out of 
focus. A more neutral way to pronounce this 
sentence isgiven in (8c): 
(8c) (in ZEIST) is een FABRIEK door BRAND 
VERWOEST 
in Zeist is a factory by fire 
destroyed 
The following condition is proposed in order 
to account for this type of data: 
(9) Prosodic Mismatch Condition (PMC): 
* \ [+focus\ ]  * \ [+focus\ ]  
o . .  
W S S W 
+ace -ace -ace + ace 
The PMC states that within a focus domain a 
weak (14) constituent (such as door brand in 
(8b,c)) may not be accented if its strong (s) 
sister (such as vetwoest in (8b,c)) is unac- 
cented. 
4. Assigning focus 
Assnrnln~ that a programme for semantic 
interpretation of unrestricted Dutch text will 
not be available within the near future, the 
following practical strategy is proposed for 
assic, ning focus to constituents in a syntactic 
tree. This strategy is based on the insight that 
word classes differ with respect to the amount 
of information that is typically conveyed by 
their members. The central idea is to assign 
113 - 
\ [+focus\]  to the maximal projections of 
categories that convey extra-grammatical 
meaning (nouns, adjectives, vex'bs, numerals 
and most of the adverbs). In addition, \[-focus\] 
is assigned to pronouns. In the case of a coor- 
dination, \[ +focus\] is assigned to each conjunct. 
Finally, \[ +focus\] is assigned to the sisters of 
focus-governing elements like niet 'not', ook 
'also', alleen 'only', ze~fs 'even', etc. Below I 
informally present an accent assignment 
algorithm which combines these focus 
assignment heuristics with the focus-to-accent 
rules discussed insection 3: 
(1) Read a sentence with its surface struc- 
ture representation. 
(2) Assign the labels w and s to nodes in 
the tree, according to the BLR above. 
(3) Assign \[-focus\] topronouns. 
(4) Apply DA: if an s-node is \[-focus\], 
replace s by w for this node and w by s 
for its sister. 
(5) Apply the RR, starting out from the 
most deeply embedded subtrees. 
(6) Assign \[+focus\] to S, (non-pronomlnal) 
NP, AP, AdvP and NumP nodes. 
(7) Assign \[+focus\] to each member of a 
coordination. 
(8) Assign \[+focus\] to the sister of a focus 
governor. 
(9) Assign \[+focus\] to every s-node, the 
sister of which has been assigned 
\[ + focus\] (thus avoiding prosodic mis- 
match, see the PMC above). 
(10) Assign accent to each word that is 
connected to a dominating \[+focus\] node 
via a path that consists exclusively of s- 
nodes. 
(11) Stop. 
5. Perceptual evaluation 
The accent assi~ment algorithm has been 
implemented as a Pascal programme. Input to 
this programme is a Dutch sentence; the user 
is asked to provide information about syntac- 
tic bracketing and labelling, and about the 
argument status of constituents. The pro- 
gramme next assigns focus structure and w/s 
labelling to the sentence and outputs the 
predicted accent pattern. 
A small informative text was used for 
evaluation of the output of the programme. In 
this evaluation experiment, the predicted 
accent patterns were compared with the accent 
patterns spontaneously produced by a human 
reader, as well as with the accent patterns as 
predicted by a naive accentuation algorithm 
which assigns an accent to every content 
word. Listeners were asked to rate the quality 
of sentences ynthesized with the respective 
accent patterns on a 7-point scale. As a 
snmmary of the results, I here present the 
mean scores for each of the conditions: 
Spontaneous accentuatiom 5.2 
Sophisticated algorithm: 4.6 
Naive algorithm" 3.3 
As one can see, human accentuation is stili 
preferred over the output of the algorithm of 
section 4. Of course this is what we expect, 
as the algorithm does not have access to the 
semantico-pragmatic properties of an input 
text, such as coreferenco and contrast. On 
the other hand we see that the algorithm, 
which does take syntactic effects on accent 
placement into account, offers a substantial 
improvement over a simple algorithm based on 
the content word - function word distinction.
