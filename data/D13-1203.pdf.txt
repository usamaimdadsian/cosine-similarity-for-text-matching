Abstract
Classical coreference systems encode various
syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena
explicitly, using heterogenous features com-
puted from hand-crafted heuristics. In con-
trast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference
system that captures such phenomena implic-
itly, with a small number of homogeneous
feature templates examining shallow proper-
ties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features
are actually more effective than the corre-
sponding hand-engineered ones at modeling
these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us
to win “easy victories” without crafted heuris-
tics. These features are successful on syntax
and discourse; however, they do not model
semantic compatibility well, nor do we see
gains from experiments with shallow seman-
tic features from the literature, suggesting that
this approach to semantics is an “uphill bat-
tle.” Nonetheless, our final system1 outper-
forms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (2011),
the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task)
by 3.5% absolute on the CoNLL metric and
outperforms the IMS system (Bjo¨rkelund and
Farkas (2012), the best publicly available En-
glish coreference system) by 1.9% absolute.
1 Introduction
Coreference resolution is a multi-faceted task: hu-
mans resolve references by exploiting contextual
and grammatical clues, as well as semantic infor-
mation and world knowledge, so capturing each of

these will be necessary for an automatic system to
fully solve the problem. Acknowledging this com-
plexity, coreference systems, either learning-based
(Bengtson and Roth, 2008; Stoyanov et al., 2010;
Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Rahman and Ng, 2011b)
or rule-based (Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Lee et
al., 2011), draw on diverse information sources and
complex heuristics to resolve pronouns, model dis-
course, determine anaphoricity, and identify seman-
tically compatible mentions. However, this leads to
systems with many heterogenous parts that can be
difficult to interpret or modify.
We build a learning-based, mention-synchronous
coreference system that aims to use the simplest pos-
sible set of features to tackle the various aspects
of coreference resolution. Though they arise from
a small number of simple templates, our features
are numerous, which works to our advantage: we
can both implicitly model important linguistic ef-
fects and capture other patterns in the data that are
not easily teased out by hand. As a result, our data-
driven, homogeneous feature set is able to achieve
high performance despite only using surface-level
document characteristics and shallow syntactic in-
formation. We win “easy victories” without design-
ing features and heuristics explicitly targeting par-
ticular phenomena.
Though our approach is successful at modeling
syntax, we find semantics to be a much more chal-
lenging aspect of coreference. Our base system
uses only two recall-oriented features on nominal
and proper mentions: head match and exact string
match. Building on these features, we critically eval-
uate several classes of semantic features which intu-
1971
itively should prove useful but have had mixed re-
sults in the literature, and we observe that they are
ineffective for our system. However, these features
are beneficial when gold mentions are provided to
our system, leading us to conclude that the large
number of system mentions extracted by most coref-
erence systems (Lee et al., 2011; Fernandes et al.,
2012) means that weak indicators cannot overcome
the bias against making coreference links. Capturing
semantic information in this shallow way is an “up-
hill battle” due to this structural property of corefer-
ence resolution.
Nevertheless, using a simple architecture and fea-
ture set, our final system outperforms the two best
publicly available English coreference systems, the
Stanford system (Lee et al., 2011) and the IMS sys-
tem (Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas, 2012), by wide mar-
gins: 3.5% absolute and 1.9% absolute, respectively,
on the CoNLL metric.
2 Experimental Setup
Throughout this work, we use the datasets from the
CoNLL 2011 shared task2 (Pradhan et al., 2011),
which is derived from the OntoNotes corpus (Hovy
et al., 2006). When applicable, we use the standard
automatic parses and NER tags for each document.
All experiments use system mentions except where
otherwise indicated. For each experiment, we report
MUC (Vilain et al., 1995), B3 (Bagga and Baldwin,
1998), and CEAFe (Luo, 2005), as well as their av-
erage, the CoNLL metric. All metrics are computed
using version 5 of the official CoNLL scorer.3
3 A Mention-Synchronous Framework
We first present the basic architecture of our corefer-
ence system, independent of a feature set. Unlike bi-
nary classification-based coreference systems where
independent binary decisions are made about each
pair (Soon et al., 2001; Bengtson and Roth, 2008;
Versley et al., 2008; Stoyanov et al., 2010), we use a
log-linear model to select at most one antecedent for
2This dataset is identical to the English portion of the
CoNLL 2012 data, except for the absence of a small pivot text.
3Note that this version of the scorer implements a modified
version ofB3, described in Cai and Strube (2010), that was used
for the CoNLL shared tasks. The implementation of CEAFe
is also not exactly as described in Luo et al. (2004), but for
completeness we include this metric as well.
each mention or determine that it begins a new clus-
ter (Denis and Baldridge, 2008). In this mention-
ranking or mention-synchronous framework, fea-
tures examine single mentions to evaluate whether
or not they are anaphoric and pairs of mentions to
evaluate whether or not they corefer. While other
work has used this framework as a starting point
for entity-level systems (Luo et al., 2004; Rahman
and Ng, 2009; Haghighi and Klein, 2010; Durrett et
al., 2013), we will show that a mention-synchronous
approach is sufficient to get state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on its own.
3.1 Mention Detection
Our system first identifies a set of predicted men-
tions from text annotated with parses and named en-
tity tags. We extract three distinct types of mentions:
proper mentions from all named entity chunks ex-
cept for those labeled as QUANTITY, CARDINAL, or
PERCENT, pronominal mentions from single words
tagged with PRP or PRP$, and nominal mentions
from all other maximal NP projections. These basic
rules are similar to those of Lee et al. (2011), except
that their system uses an additional set of filtering
rules designed to discard instances of pleonastic it,
partitives, certain quantified noun phrases, and other
spurious mentions. In contrast to this highly engi-
neered approach and to systems which use a trained
classifier to compute anaphoricity separately (Rah-
man and Ng, 2009; Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas, 2012),
we aim for the highest possible recall of gold men-
tions with a low-complexity method, leaving us with
a large number of spurious system mentions that we
will have to reject later.
3.2 Coreference Model
Figure 1 shows the mention-ranking architecture
that serves as the backbone of our coreference sys-
tem. Assume we have extracted n mentions from
a document x, where x denotes the surface proper-
ties of a document and any precomputed informa-
tion. The ith mention in a document has an asso-
ciated random variable ai taking values in the set
{1, . . . , i?1, NEW}; this variable specifies mention
i’s selected antecedent or indicates that it begins a
new coreference chain. A setting of the ai, denoted
by a = (a1, ..., an), implies a unique set of corefer-
ence chains C that serve as our system output.

Figure 1: The basic structure of our coreference model. The ith mention in a document has i possible antecedence
choices: link to one of the i? 1 preceding mentions or begin a new cluster. We place a distribution over these choices
with a log-linear model. Structurally different kinds of errors are weighted differently to optimize for final coreference
loss functions; error types are shown corresponding to the decisions for each mention.
We use a log linear model of the conditional dis-
tribution P (a|x) as follows:
P (a|x) ? exp
(
n?
i=1
w>f(i, ai, x)
)
where f(i, ai, x) is a feature function that examines
the coreference decision ai for mention i with doc-
ument context x. When ai = NEW, the features
fired indicate the suitability of the given mention to
be anaphoric or not; when ai = j for some j, the
features express aspects of the pairwise linkage, and
can examine any relevant attributes of the anaphor
i or the antecedent j, since information about each
mention is contained in x.
Inference in this model is efficient: because
logP (a|x) decomposes linearly over mentions, we
can compute ai = argmaxai P (ai|x) separately
for each mention and return the set of coreference
chains implied by these decisions.
3.3 Learning
During learning, we optimize for conditional log-
likelihood augmented with a parameterized loss
function (Durrett et al., 2013). The main compli-
cating factor in this process is that the supervision
in coreference consists of a gold clustering C? de-
fined over gold mentions. This is problematic for
two reasons: first, because the clustering is defined
over gold mentions rather than our system mentions,
and second, because a clustering does not specify a
full antecedent structure of the sort our model pro-
duces. We can address the first of these problems
by imputing singleton clusters for mentions that do
not appear in the gold standard; our system will then
simply learn to put spurious mentions in their own
clusters. Singletons are always removed before eval-
uation because the OntoNotes corpus does not anno-
tate them, so in this way we can neatly dispose of
spurious mentions. To address the lack of explicit
antecedents in C?, we simply sum over all possible
antecedent structures licensed by the gold clusters.
Formally, we will maximize the conditional log-
likelihood of the set A(C?) of antecedent vectors
a for a document that are consistent with the gold
annotation.4 Consistency for an antecedent choice
ai under gold clusters C? is defined as follows:
1. If ai = j, ai is consistent iff mentions i and j
are present in C? and are in the same cluster.
2. If ai = NEW, ai is consistent off mention i is
not present in C?, or it is present in C? and has
no gold antecedents, or it is present in C? and
none of its gold antecedents are among the set
of system predicted mentions.
Given t training examples of the form (xk, C?k),
we write the following likelihood function:
`(w) =
t?
k=1
log
?
?
?
a?A(C?k)
P ?(a|xk)
?
?+ ??w?1
where P ?(a|xk) ? P (a|xk) exp(l(a,C?k)) with
l(a,C?) being a real-valued loss function. The loss
4Because of this marginalization over latent antecedent
choices, our objective is non-convex.
1973
here plays an analogous role to the loss in struc-
tured max-margin objectives; incorporating it into a
conditional likelihood objective is a technique called
softmax-margin (Gimpel and Smith, 2010).
Our loss function l(a,C?) is a weighted linear
combination of three error types, examples of which
are shown in Figure 1. A false anaphor (FA) error
occurs when ai is chosen to be anaphoric when it
should start a new cluster. A false new (FN) error oc-
curs in the opposite case, when ai wrongly indicates
a new cluster when it should be anaphoric. Finally,
a wrong link (WL) error occurs when the antecedent
chosen for ai is the wrong antecedent (but ai is in-
deed anaphoric). Our final parameterized loss func-
tion is a weighted sum of the counts of these three
error types:
l(a,C?) = ?FAFA(a,C?) + ?FNFN(a,C?) + ?WLWL(a,C?)
where FA(a,C?) gives the number of false anaphor
errors in prediction a with gold chains C? (FN and
WL are analogous). By setting ?FA low and ?FN
high relative to ?WL, we can counterbalance the
high number of singleton mentions and bias the sys-
tem towards making more coreference linkages. We
set (?FA, ?FN, ?WL) = (0.1, 3.0, 1.0) and ? =
0.001 and optimize the objective using AdaGrad
(Duchi et al., 2011).
4 Easy Victories from Surface Features
Our primary goal with this work is to show that a
high-performance coreference system is attainable
with a small number of feature templates that use
only surface-level information sources. These fea-
tures will be general-purpose and capture linguistic
effects to the point where standard heuristic-driven
features are no longer needed in our system.
4.1 SURFACE Features and Conjunctions
Our SURFACE feature set only considers the follow-
ing properties of mentions and mention pairs:
• Mention type (nominal, proper, or pronominal)
• The complete string of a mention
• The semantic head of a mention
• The first word and last word of each mention

Table 1: Our SURFACE feature set, which exploits a
small number of surface-level mention properties. Fea-
ture counts for each template are computed over the train-
ing set, and include features generated by our conjunction
scheme (not explicitly shown in the table; see Figure 2),
which yields large numbers of features at varying levels
of expressivity.
• The word immediately preceding and the word
immediately following a mention
• Mention length, in words
• Two distance measures between mentions
(number of sentences and number of mentions)
Table 1 shows the SURFACE feature set. Features
that look only at the current mention fire on all de-
cisions (ai = j or ai = NEW), whereas features
that look at the antecedent in any way (the latter
two groups of features) only fire on pairwise link-
ages (ai 6= NEW).
Two conjunctions of each feature are also in-
cluded: first with the “type” of the mention be-
ing resolved (either NOMINAL, PROPER, or, if it is
pronominal, the citation form of the pronoun), and
then additionally with the antecedent type (only if
the feature is over a pairwise link). This conjunc-
tion process is shown in Figure 2. Note that features
that just examine the antecedent will end up with

mention as well, as shown with the ANT. HEAD fea-
ture in the figure.
Finally, we found it beneficial for our lexical indi-
cator features to only fire on words occurring at least
20 times in the training set; for rare words, we use
the part of speech of the word instead.
The performance of our system is shown in Ta-
ble 2. We contrast our performance with that of
the Stanford system (Lee et al. (2011), the winner
of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) and the IMS sys-
tem (Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly
available English coreference system). Despite its
simplicity, our SURFACE system is sufficient to out-
perform these sophisticated systems: the Stanford
system uses a cascade of ten rule-based sieves each
of which has customized heuristics, and the IMS
system uses a similarly long pipeline consisting of
a learned referentiality classifier followed by multi-
ple resolvers, which are run in sequence and rely on
the outputs of the previous resolvers as features.
4.2 Data-Driven versus Heuristic-Driven
Features
Why are the SURFACE features sufficient to give
high coreference performance, when they do not
make apparent reference to important linguistic phe-
nomena? The main reason is that they actually do
capture the same phenomena as standard corefer-

ence features, just implicitly. For example, rather
than having rules targeting person, number, gender,
or animacy of mentions, we use conjunctions with
pronoun identity, which contains this information.
Rather than explicitly writing a feature targeting def-
initeness, our indicators on the first word of a men-
tion will capture this and other effects. And finally,
rather than targeting centering theory (Grosz et al.,
1995) with rule-based features identifying syntac-
tic positions (Stoyanov et al., 2010; Haghighi and
Klein, 2010), our features on word context can iden-
tify configurational clues like whether a mention
is preceded or followed by a verb, and therefore
whether it is likely in subject or object position.5
Not only are data-driven features able to capture
the same phenomena as heuristic-driven features,
but they do so at a finer level of granularity, and can
therefore model more patterns in the data. To con-
trast these two types of features, we experiment with
three ablated versions of our system, where we re-
place data-driven features with their heuristic-driven
counterparts:
1. Instead of using an indicator on the first word
of a mention (1STWORD), we instead fire
a feature based on that mention’s manually-
computed definiteness (DEF).
2. Instead of conjoining features on pronominal-
pronominal linkages with the citation form of
5Heuristic-driven approaches were historically more appro-
priate, since past coreference corpora such as MUC and ACE
were smaller and therefore more prone to overfitting feature-
rich models. However, the OntoNotes dataset contains thou-
sands of documents, so having support for features is less of a
concern.

with a PRONOUN indicator and add features
targeting the person, number, gender, and an-
imacy of the two pronouns (AGR).
3. Instead of using our context features on the
preceding and following word (CONTEXT), we
use manual determinations of when mentions
are in subject, direct object, indirect objection,
or oblique position (POSN).
All rules for computing person, number, gender, an-
imacy, definiteness, and syntactic position are taken
from the system of Lee et al. (2011).
Table 3 shows each of the target ablations, as well
as the SURFACE system with the DEF, AGR, and
POSN features added. While the heuristic-driven
feature always help over the corresponding ablated
system, they cannot do the work of the fine-grained
data-driven features. Most tellingly, though, none of
the heuristic-driven features give statistically signifi-
cant improvements on top of the data-driven features
we have already included, indicating that we are at
the point of diminishing returns on modeling those
specific phenomena. While this does not preclude
further engineering to take better advantage of other
syntactic constraints, our simple features represent
an “easy victory” on this subtask.
5 Uphill Battles on Semantics
In Section 4, we gave a simple set of features that
yielded a high-performance coreference system; this
high performance is possible because features tar-
geting only superficial properties in a fine-grained
way can actually model complex linguistic con-
straints. However, while our existing features cap-
ture syntactic and discourse-level phenomena sur-
prisingly well, they are not effective at capturing se-
mantic phenomena like type compatibility. We will
show that due to structural aspects of the coreference
resolution problem, even a combination of several
shallow semantic features from the literature fails to
adequately model semantics.
5.1 Analysis of the SURFACE System
What can the SURFACE system resolve correctly,
and what errors does it still make? To answer this
question, we will split mentions into several cate-
gories based on their observable properties and the
gold standard coreference information, and exam-
ine our system’s accuracy on each mention subclass
in order to more thoroughly characterize its perfor-
mance.6 These categories represent important dis-
tinctions in terms of the difficulty of mention reso-
lution for our system.
We first split mentions into three categories by
their status in the gold standard: singleton (unanno-
tated in the OntoNotes corpus), starting a new entity
with at least two mentions, or anaphoric. It is impor-
tant to note that while singletons and mentions start-
ing new entities are outwardly similar in that they
have no antecedents, and the prediction should be
the same in either case (NEW), we treat them as dis-
tinct because the factors that impact the coreference
decision differ in the two cases. Mentions that start
new clusters are semantically similar to anaphoric
mentions, but may be marked by heaviness or by a
tendency to be named entities, whereas singletons
may be generic or temporal NPs which might be
thought of as coreferent in a loose sense, but are not
6This method of analysis is similar to that undertaken in
Stoyanov et al. (2009) and Rahman and Ng (2011b), though
we split our mentions along different axes, and can simply eval-
uate on accuracy because our decisions do not directly imply
multiple links, as they do in binary classification-based systems
(Stoyanov et al., 2009) or in entity-mention models (Rahman
and Ng, 2011b).

Table 4: Analysis of our SURFACE system on the de-
velopment set. We characterize each predicted mention
by its status in the gold standard (singleton, starting a
new entity, or anaphoric), its type (pronominal or nom-
inal/proper), and by whether its head has appeared as the
head of a previous mention. Each cell shows our sys-
tem’s accuracy on that mention class as well as the size
of the class. The biggest weakness of our system appears
to be its inability to resolve anaphoric mentions with new
heads (bottom-left cell).
included in the OntoNotes dataset due to choices in
the annotation standard.
Second, we divide mentions by their type,
pronominal versus nominal/proper; we then further
subdivide nominals and propers based on whether or
not the head word of the mention has appeared as the
head of a previous mention in the document.
Table 4 shows the results of our analysis. In
each cell, we show the fraction of mentions that
we correctly resolve (i.e., for which we make an
antecedence decision consistent with the gold stan-
dard), as well as the total number of mentions falling
into that cell. First, we observe that there are a sur-
prisingly large number of singleton mentions with
misleading head matches to previous mentions (of-
ten recurring temporal nouns phrases, like July).
The features in our system targeting anaphoricity are
useful for exactly this reason: the more bad head
matches we can rule out based on other criteria, the
more strongly we can rely on head match to make
correct linkages.
Our system is most noticeably poor at resolving
anaphoric mentions whose heads have not appeared
before. The fact that exact match and head match
are our only recall-oriented features on nominals
and propers is starkly apparent here: when we can-
not rely on head match, as is true for this mention
class, we only resolve 7.9% of anaphoric mentions
correctly.7 Many of the mentions in this category
7There are an additional 346 anaphoric nominal/proper men-
tions in the 2nd+ category whose heads only appeared previ-
ously as part of a different cluster; we only resolve 1.7% of
can only be correctly resolved by exploiting world
knowledge, so we will need to include features that
capture this knowledge in some fashion.
5.2 Incorporating Shallow Semantics
As we were able to incorporate syntax with shal-
low features, so too might we hope to incorporate
semantics. However, the semantic information con-
tained even in a coreference corpus of thousands
of documents is insufficient to generalize to unseen
data,8 so system designers have turned to exter-
nal resources such as semantic classes derived from
WordNet (Soon et al., 2001), WordNet hypernymy
or synonymy (Stoyanov et al., 2010), semantic simi-
larity computed from online resources (Ponzetto and
Strube, 2006), named entity type features, gender
and number match using the dataset of Bergsma and
Lin (2006), and features from unsupervised clus-
ters (Hendrickx and Daelemans, 2007; Durrett et al.,
2013). In this section, we consider the following
subset of these information sources:
• WordNet hypernymy and synonymy
• Number and gender data for nominals and
propers from Bergsma and Lin (2006)
• Named entity types
• Latent clusters computed from English Giga-
word (Graff et al., 2007), where a latent cluster
label generates each nominal head (excluding
pronouns) and a conjunction of its verbal gov-
ernor and semantic role, if any (Durrett et al.,
2013). We use twenty clusters, which include
clusters like president and leader (things which
announce).
Together, we call these the SEM features. We
show results from this expansion of the feature set in
Table 5. When using system mentions, the improve-
ments are not statistically significant on every met-
ric, and are quite marginal given that these features
add information that is intuitively central to corefer-
ence and otherwise unavailable to the system. We
explore the reasons behind this in the next section.
these extremely tricky cases correctly.
8We experimented with bilexical features on head pairs, but
they did not give statistically significant improvements over the
SURFACE features.

Table 5: CoNLL metric scores on the development set
for our SEM features when added on top of our SURFACE
features. We experiment on both system mentions and
gold mentions. Surprisingly, despite the fact that absolute
performance numbers are much higher on gold mentions
and there is less room for improvement, the semantic fea-
tures help much more than they do on system mentions.
5.3 Analysis of Semantic Features
The main reason that weak semantic cues are not
more effective is the small fraction of positive coref-
erence links present in the training data. From Ta-
ble 4, the number of annotated coreferent spans in
the OntoNotes data is about a factor of five smaller
than the number of system mentions.9 This both
means that most NPs are not coreferent, and for
those that are, choosing the correct links is much
more difficult because of the large number of pos-
sible antecedents. Even head match, which is gen-
erally considered a high-precision indicator (Lee et
al., 2011), would introduce many spurious corefer-
ence arcs if applied too liberally (see Table 4).
In light of this fact, a system needs very strong
evidence to overcome the default hypothesis that a
mention is not coreferent, and a weak indicator will
have such a high “false positive” rate that it cannot
be relied on (given high weight, this feature would
do more harm than good, by introducing many false
linkages).
To confirm this intuition, we show in the bot-
tom part of Table 5 results when we apply these se-
mantic features on top of our SURFACE system on
gold mentions, where there are no singletons. In the
gold mention setting, we see that the semantic fea-
tures give a consistent improvement on every metric.
Moreover, if we look at a breakdown of errors, the
main improvement the semantic features give us is
on resolution of anaphoric nominals with no head
9This observation is more general than just our system: the
majority of coreference systems, including the winners of the
CoNLL shared tasks (Lee et al., 2011; Fernandes et al., 2012),
opt for high mention recall and resolve a relatively large number
of system mentions.
match: accuracy on the 1601 mentions that fall into
this category improves from 28.0% to 37.9%. On
predicted mentions, by contrast, this category only
improves from 7.9% to 12.2%, a much smaller ab-
solute improvement and one that comes at the ex-
pense of performance on most other resolution class.
The one class that does not get worse, singleton pro-
nouns, actually improves by a similar 4% margin,
indicating that roughly half of the gains we observe
are not even necessarily a result of our features do-
ing what they were designed to do.
Our weak cues do yield some small gains, so there
is hope that better weak indicators of semantic com-
patibility could prove more useful. However, while
extremely high-precision approaches with carefully
engineered features have been shown to be suc-
cessful (Rahman and Ng, 2011a; Bansal and Klein,
2012; Recasens et al., 2013a), we conclude that cap-
turing semantics in a data-driven, shallow manner
remains an uphill battle.
6 FINAL System and Results
While semantic features ended up giving only
marginal benefit, we have demonstrated that nev-
ertheless our SURFACE system is a state-of-the-art
English coreference system. However, there remain
a few natural features that we omitted in order to
keep the system as simple as possible, since they
were orthogonal to the discussion of data-driven
versus heuristic-driven features and do not target
world knowledge. Before giving final results, we
will present a small set of additional features that
consider four additional mention properties beyond
those in Section 4.1:
• Whether two mentions are nested
• Ancestry of each mention head: the depen-
dency parent and grandparent POS tags and arc
directions (shown in Figure 3)
• The speaker of each mention
• Number and gender of each mention as deter-
mined by Bergsma and Lin (2006)
The specific additional features we use are shown
in Table 6. Note that unlike in Section 5, we use
the number and gender information only on the an-
tecedent. Due to our conjunction scheme, both this

rational information than our context word features do: in
this example, president is in a characteristic indirect ob-
ject position based on its dependency parents, and Obama
is the subject of the main verb of the sentence.
semantic information and the speaker information
can apply in a fine-grained way to different pro-
nouns, and can therefore improve pronoun resolu-
tion substantially; however, these features generally
only improve pronoun resolution.
Full results for our SURFACE and FINAL feature
sets are shown in Table 7. Again, we compare to Lee
et al. (2011) and Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas (2012).10
Despite our system’s emphasis on one-pass resolu-
tion with as simple a feature set as possible, we are
able to outperform even these sophisticated systems
by a wide margin.
7 Related Work
Many of the individual features we employ in the FI-
NAL feature set have appeared in other coreference
systems (Bjo¨rkelund and Nugues, 2011; Rahman
and Ng, 2011b; Fernandes et al., 2012). However,
other authors have often emphasized bilexical fea-
tures on head pairs, whereas our features are heavily
monolexical. For feature conjunctions, other authors
have exploited three classes (Lee et al., 2011) or au-
tomatically learned conjunction schemes (Fernandes
et al., 2012; Lassalle and Denis, 2013), but to our
knowledge we are the first to do fine-grained mod-
eling of every pronoun. Inclusion of a hierarchy of
10Discrepancies between scores here and those printed in
Pradhan et al. (2012) arise from two sources: improvements
to the system of Lee et al. (2011) since the first CoNLL shared
task, and a fix to the scoring of B3 in the official scorer since
results of the two CoNLL shared tasks were released. Unfor-
tunately, because of this bug in the scoring program, direct
comparison to the printed results of the other highest-scoring
English systems, Fernandes et al. (2012) and Martschat et al.
(2012), is impossible.

FACE system, two conjoined variants of each feature

noun), then with the types of both mentions in the pair.
These conjunctions allow antecedent features on gender
and number to impact pronoun resolution, and they al-
low speaker match to capture effects like I and you being
coreferent when the speakers differ.
features with regularization also means that we or-
ganically get distinctions among different mention
types without having to choose a level of granularity
a priori, unlike the distinct classifiers employed by
Denis and Baldridge (2008).
In terms of architecture, many coreference sys-
tems operate in a pipelined fashion, making par-
tial decisions about coreference or pruning arcs
before full resolution. Some systems use sepa-
rate rule-based and learning-based passes (Chen
and Ng, 2012; Fernandes et al., 2012), a series
of learning-based passes (Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas,
2012), or referentiality classifiers that prune the set
of mentions before resolution (Rahman and Ng,
2009; Bjo¨rkelund and Farkas, 2012; Recasens et
al., 2013b). By contrast, our system resolves all
mentions in one pass and does not need pruning:
the SURFACE system can train in less than two
hours without any subsampling of coreference arcs,
and rule-based pruning of coreference arcs actually
causes our system to perform less well, since our
features can learn valuable information from these
negative examples.

8 Conclusion
We have presented a coreference system that uses a
simple, homogeneous set of features in a discrim-
inative learning framework to achieve high perfor-
mance. Large numbers of lexicalized, data-driven
features implicitly model linguistic phenomena such
as definiteness and centering, obviating the need for
heuristic-driven rules explicitly targeting these same
phenomena. Additional semantic features give only
slight benefit beyond head match because they do
not provide strong enough signals of coreference to
improve performance in the system mention setting;
modeling semantic similarity still requires complex
outside information and deep heuristics.
Our system, the Berkeley Coreference
Resolution System, is publicly available at
