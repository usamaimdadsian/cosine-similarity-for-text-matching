Abstract
The difficult language in Electronic Health
Records (EHRs) presents a challenge to
patients’ understanding of their own con-
ditions. One approach to lowering the
barrier is to provide tailored patient ed-
ucation based on their own EHR notes.
We are developing a system to retrieve
EHR note-tailored online consumer ori-
ented health education materials. We ex-
plored topic model and key concept identi-
fication methods to construct queries from
the EHR notes. Our experiments show
that queries using identified key concepts
with pseudo-relevance feedback signifi-
cantly outperform (over 10-fold improve-
ment) the baseline system of using the full
text note.
1 Introduction
Allowing patients access to their own electronic
health records (EHRs) can enhance medical un-
derstanding and provide clinical relevant bene-
fits (Wiljer et al., 2006), including increased med-
ication adherence (Delbanco et al., 2012). How-
ever, EHR notes present unique challenges to the
average patients. Since these notes are not usually
targeted at the patients (Mossanen et al., 2014),
languages that may be difficult for non-medical
professionals to comprehend are prevalent, in-
cluding medical terms, abbreviations, and medi-
cal domain-specific language patterns. The valu-
able and authoritative information contained in the
EHR is thus less accessible to the patients, who ul-
timately stand to benefit the most from the infor-
mation.
To address the challenges, we are developing a
system to link medical notes to targeted education
materials from trusted resources. The textual nar-
ratives in the EHR notes are not conducive to ef-
fective and efficient query. We therefore explored
topic model and key concept identification meth-
ods to construct short queries from the EHR notes.
2 Related Work
Patent retrieval (Fujii et al., 2007) is similar to
this work, as the queries are usually long and
complex patent documents. Several methods
have been proposed to construct shorter queries
from the documents. For example, words in the
summary section of a patent document can be
ranked by TFIDF scores and extracted to form a
query (Xue and Croft, 2009). Sentences that are
similar to pseudo-relevant documents according to
a language model are also used to reduce query
length (Ganguly et al., 2011). Other similarity
measures such as Kullback-Leibler divergence are
used to extract terms, which are expanded to gen-
erate queries in the patent retrieval domain (Mahd-
abi et al., 2012). However, the patent retrieval do-
main is recall-driven, while in our scenario, pa-
tients are generally not expected to read relevant
education documents exhaustively.
Various methods have also been proposed to re-
trieve documents relevant to passages of text or
web documents. A model extended from CRF is
proposed to identify noun phrases and named en-
tities from a user-selected passage as queries (Lee
and Croft, 2012). Similarly, noun phrases in a ver-
bose query are also used as candidates for key con-
cepts (Bendersky and Croft, 2008). Other related
work that reduces long queries includes ranking all
subsets of the original query (Kumaran and Car-
valho, 2009). However, typical EHR notes are
longer than the passages and verbose queries in
these systems, which makes the graphical model
and other learning based models less efficient.
Moreover, parsers as required by Bendersky et
al. (2009) and Named Entity Recognizers for the
medical domain are less effective than the general
domain.

is an
IR challenge to link medical cases to information
relevant for patient care. Unlike our system, this
task is designed to address the physicians’ infor-
mation needs of diagnosis, testing and treatment
for the patients.
3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Data
MedlinePlus
2
provides current and reliable infor-
mation about over 900 health topics pages and
1000 medication pages to users in consumer-
oriented lay language. Additionally, the medi-
cal encyclopedia section includes over 7000 arti-
cles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and
surgeries. We include in this study the textual nar-
ratives in the “health topics”, “drugs, supplements,
and herbal information”, and “medical encyclope-
dia” sections of the MedlinePlus as the collection
of educational materials. There are a total of ap-
proximately 9400 articles in this collection, which
we designate as MedlinePlus. Table 3.1 summa-
rizes the characteristics of the collection.
We index the MedlinePlus documents with
Galago, an advanced open source search engine.
Galago implements the inference network retrieval
model (Turtle and Croft, 1991). This model cal-
culates the probability of the user’s information
needs being satisfied given a document in a di-
rected acyclic graph. This framework is applied
in many information retrieval tasks, and shown to
be successful (Metzler et al., 2004).
Twenty progress notes are randomly selected
from a corpus of de-identified EHR notes as the
EHR document collection. Each note contains on
average 261 tokens, with a standard deviation of
133. A physician read each note, and manually
identified relevant education materials from the
MedlinePlus documents. Each EHR note is linked
to 22 education material documents on average.
For example, Table 3.1 shows the summary of one
EHR note and some of its relevant MedlinePlus
documents. There are approximately 30 sentences
or 360 tokens in the actual document.
We adopted Mean Average Precision (MAP)
and Precision at 10 to evaluate the IR systems.

uments
3.2 IR Systems
We investigate several query generation ap-
proaches, whereby short queries are built from an
EHR note. In our queries, sequential dependence
model (Metzler and Croft, 2005) was used to cap-
ture the dependencies in a multi-word query term.
In this model, given a query, documents are ranked
based on features of documents containing a single
query term, two query terms sequentially appear-
ing in the query, and two query terms in any or-
der. This model has been shown to be effective in
many applications (Balasubramanian et al., 2007;
Cartright et al., 2011; Bendersky et al., 2009).
3.2.1 Baseline Approach
Our baseline approach issues each of the 20 test
EHR notes as the query to the MedlinePlus doc-
ument index and retrieves top 500 relevant doc-
uments. Although queries are not generally as
long as EHR notes, an average patient without ad-
equate medical knowledge may have difficulties
constructing effective queries. Thus, this baseline
can be considered as a proxy to how a patient ac-
tually conducts his own search in the real word.
3.2.2 LDA Models
We trained LDA topic models from over 6000 de-
identified EHR notes to identify prominent top-
ics from the test notes. The number of topics
are selected based on retrieval performance. LDA
models extract distributions over individual word
tokens for each topic. However, medical con-

cepts often contain more than one token. We em-
ploy turbo topics (Blei and Lafferty, 2009) to find
phrases from these topics. This method builds sig-
nificant n-grams based on a language model of ar-
bitrary length expressions. Queries are then gener-
ated from the n-grams. We take the top 5 phrases
as queries from the topics that has a combined
probability of over 80%.
3.2.3 Learning-Based Key Concept
Identification
We also developed learning-based key concept
identification to build queries from EHR notes.
We employed Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
model (Lafferty et al., 2001) to identify key con-
cepts, which are most in need of explanation by
external education materials. These key con-
cepts can be considered in a broad sense topics,
as they also capture various aspects of the EHR
note content. We explored lexical, morpholog-
ical, UMLS (Bodenreider, 2004) semantic type,
and word embeddings as features. The word em-
beddings were induced from a combination of
Wikipedia articles in the Medicine category and
de-identified EHR progress notes.
Three CRF models are learned using differ-
ent training data. One uses Wikipedia articles.
Wikipedia, especially the Medicine category, is an
appealing resource for such information as the hu-
man curated links in them are naturally concepts
that are important. However, the number of ar-
ticles in the Medicine category outnumbers our
EHR notes substantially, we therefore restricted
the Wikipedia articles to the Diabetes category.
The paragraphs before the table of contents box
are used. Anchor texts in these paragraphs are
treated as key concepts. The second model uses
EHR notes. Training data for the model was gen-
erated from the retrieval gold standard. A phrase
in an EHR note would be annotated as a key con-
cept if it matches the title of one of the note’s
relevant MedlinePlus documents. Lastly, we aug-
mented the EHR corpus with Wikipedia articles,

Table 3: System Performance
and compared its performance to the other CRF-
based models. Leave-one-out cross validation is
used in the last two models.
3.2.4 Query Expansion
We explored query expansion by incorporating
relevance feedback from pseudo-relevant docu-
ments. The initial queries are generated using
methods described previously. Among the top 20
retrieval results, those with a title that matches
one of the identified key concepts are considered
pseudo-relevant documents. This additional re-
quirement is to ensure that the expanded concepts
do not drift from the main topic of the medical
notes. From these documents, medical concepts
are extracted using MetaMap (Aronson and Lang,
2010). These concepts, with their synonyms pro-
vided by UMLS, are used as expansions.
4 Experiment Results
4.1 LDA Models
100 topics are learned from the de-identified EHR
note collection. This level of topic granularity
shows the best performance in our experiments.
The retrieval result is shown in Table 4, row 3. The
improvement over the baseline is 5.4 folds, and is
statistically significant using a paired Student’s t-
test (p < 0.05).

three CRF models is shown in Table 4.2. Retrieval

performance of these models are shown in Table 4,
rows 4 to 6. All systems showed a statistical sig-
nificant improvement over the baseline. The last
model’s improvement is also statistically signif-
icant over the LDA approach. Query expansion
methods further improved system performance, as
shown in Table 4.2.
5 Discussions
From the LDA model, Table 5 shows the top 10 n-
grams from 7 topics trained on the medical text. It
is clear that while topics like the first one capture
medical concepts, others like the second one do
not. The LDA results also highlight the noisy na-
ture of the EHR notes. Queries formed by includ-
ing the generic or noisy terms such as “continue
on” will not benefit retrieval results. Examining
the retrieval results, we found that when the promi-
nent topics include medical concepts, the top 10
results usually contain at least one relevant docu-
ment. When only generic topics are identified, rel-
evant documents are absent in the top 10 results.
The CRF models, on the other hand, are bet-
ter at capturing the concepts in the EHR notes.
All three models outperformed the LDA model.
One drawback of using models trained from title-
matching phrases is that the identified key con-
cepts fail to cover the scope of the medical con-
cepts contained in an EHR note. On average
only 23.6% of the concepts are annotated as key
phrases in each note. In the evaluation of the CRF
models for their key concept identification perfor-

Table 6: Top 10 n-grams from 7 topics using the

mance, inclusion of Wikipedia data slightly de-
creased the F1 score when they were tested on
EHR notes. This can be attributed to the fact that
the Wikipedia articles outnumbered the EHR data
by 7 times. However, this data helped improve the
coverage of the key concepts. In one document,
the augmented model identified two more out of
the total eight key concepts.
Finally, to investigate the gap between medi-
cal language and lay language, we substituted the
medical concepts recognized by MetaMap with
their consumer-oriented counterparts created by
the Consumer Health Vocabulary (CHV) Initia-
tive (Zeng and Tse, 2006). Performance using the
substituted EHR notes as shown in Table 4, row 2
more than doubled. The gap highlights the issue
that patients may have difficulty finding relevant
health information without assistance due to vo-
cabulary mismatch.
6 Conclusions, Limitations and Future
Plan
We have shown that using full EHR notes is in-
effective at retrieving relevant education materi-
als. Identifying key concepts of an EHR note and
then using the key concepts as query terms re-
582
sult in significantly improved performance (over
10-fold). Furthermore, a query expansion ap-
proach in which key concepts are complemented
by other medical concepts from pseudo-relevant
documents further improves the performance.
One limitation of our design is that only one
physician provided relevancy judgments. Addi-
tional annotators would provide a more rigorous
set of gold standard, allowing us to measure inter-
annotator agreement.
There are several directions we can explore in
our future research. Firstly, our key concept iden-
tification methods are not optimized for the re-
trieval results, but for the identification subtask
only. We hypothesize that directly optimizing the
key concept identifier for retrieval would lead to
better performance. We would also investigate do-
main adaptation techniques to learn key concept
identification models from other data sources.
