Abstract 
In this paper, we employ the centering the-
ory in pronoun resolution from the seman-
tic perspective. First, diverse semantic role 
features with regard to different predicates 
in a sentence are explored. Moreover, given 
a pronominal anaphor, its relative ranking 
among all the pronouns in a sentence, ac-
cording to relevant semantic role informa-
tion and its surface position, is incorporated. 
In particular, the use of both the semantic 
role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature in pronoun resolution is 
guided by extending the centering theory 
from the grammatical level to the semantic 
level in tracking the local discourse focus. 
Finally, detailed pronominal subcategory 
features are incorporated to enhance the 
discriminative power of both the semantic 
role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature. Experimental results on the 
ACE 2003 corpus show that the centering-
motivated features contribute much to pro-
noun resolution.  
1 Introduction 
Coreference accounts for cohesion in a text and 
is, in a sense, the hyperlink for a natural lan-
guage. Especially, a coreference instance de-
notes an identity of reference and holds between 
two referring expressions, which can be named 
entities, definite noun phrases, pronouns and so 
on. Coreference resolution is the process of link-
ing together multiple referring expressions of a 
given entity in the world. The key in coreference 
resolution is to determine the antecedent for 
each referring expression in a text. The ability of 
linking referring expressions both within a sen-
tence and across the sentences in a text is critical 
to discourse and language understanding in gen-
eral. For example, coreference resolution is a 
key task in information extraction, machine 
translation, text summarization, and question 
answering. 
There is a long tradition of research on 
coreference resolution within computational lin-
guistics. While earlier knowledge-lean ap-
proaches heavily depend on domain and 
linguistic knowledge (Carter 1987; Carbonell 
and Brown 1988) and have significantly influ-
enced the research, the later approaches usually 
rely on diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic 
properties of referring expressions (Soon et al., 
2001;Ng and Cardie, 2002; Zhou et al., 2004). 
Current research has been focusing on exploiting 
semantic information in coreference resolution. 
For example, Yang et al (2005) proposed a tem-
plate-based statistical approach to compute the 
semantic compatibility between a pronominal 
anaphor and an antecedent candidate, and Yang 
and Su (2007) explored semantic relatedness 
information from automatically discovered pat-
terns, while Ng (2007) automatically induced 
semantic class knowledge from a treebank and 
explored its application in coreference resolution. 
Particularly, this paper focuses on the center-
ing theory (Sidner,1981;Grosz et al.,1995; 
Tetreault,2001), which reveals the significant 
impact of the local focus on referring expres-
sions in that the antecedent of a referring expres-
sion usually depends on the center of attention 
throughout the local discourse segment (Mit-
kov,1998). Although the centering theory has 
been considered as a critical theory and the driv-
ing force behind the coreferential phenomena 
since its proposal, its application in coreference 
resolution (in particular pronoun resolution) has 
been somewhat disappointing: it fails to improve 
or even harms the performance of the state-of-
987
 the-art coreference resolution systems in previ-
ous research (e.g. Yang et al. 2004). This may be 
due to that centering was originally proposed as 
a model of discourse coherence instead of 
coreference. 
The purpose of this paper is to employ the 
centering theory in pronoun resolution by ex-
tending it from the grammatical level to the se-
mantic level. The intuition behind our approach 
is that, via determining the semantic roles of 
referring expressions in a sentence, such as 
agent and patient, we can derive various center-
ing theory-motivated features in tracking the 
continuity or shift of the local discourse focus, 
thus allowing us to include document-level 
event descriptive information in resolving the 
coreferential relations between referring expres-
sions.  
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
research, which successfully applies the center-
ing theory in pronoun resolution from the se-
mantic perspective.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 briefly describes related work in em-
ploying the centering theory and semantic in-
formation in coreference resolution. Then, the 
centering theory is introduced in Section 3 while 
Section 4 details how to employ the centering 
theory from the semantic perspective. Section 5 
reports and discusses the experimental results. 
Finally, we conclude our work in Section 6. 
2 Related Work 
This section briefly overviews the related work 
in coreference resolution from both the centering 
theory and semantic perspectives. 
2.1 Centering Theory 
In the literature, there has been much research in 
the centering theory and its application to 
coreference resolution. 
In the centering theory itself, since the origi-
nal work of Sidner (1979) on immediate focus-
ing of pronouns and the subsequent work of 
Joshi and Weinstein (1981) on centering and 
inferences, much research has been done, in-
cluding centering and linguistic realizations 
(Cote 1993; Prince and Walker 1995), empirical 
and psycholinguistic evaluation of centering 
predictions (Gordon et al  1993,1995; Brennan 
1995; Walker et al 1998; Kibble 2001), and the 
cross-linguistic work on centering (Ziv and 
Crosz1994). 
In applications of the centering theory to 
coreference resolution, representative work in-
cludes Brennan et al. (1987), Strube (1998), 
Tetreault (1999) and Yang et al. (2004). Brennan 
et al. (1987) presented a centering theory-based 
formalism in modeling the local focus structure 
in discourse and used it to track the discourse 
context in binding occurring pronouns to corre-
sponding entities. In particular, a BFP (Brennan, 
Friedman and Pollard) algorithm is proposed to 
extend the original centering model to include 
two additional transitions called smooth shift 
and rough shift. Strube (1998) proposed an S-list 
model, assuming that a referring expression pre-
fers a hearer-old discourse entity to other hearer-
new candidates. Tetreault (1999) further ad-
vanced the BFP algorithm by adopting a left-to-
right breadth first walk of the syntactic parse 
trees to rank the antecedent candidates. However, 
the above methods have not been systematically 
evaluated on large annotated corpora, such as 
MUC and ACE. Thus their effects are still un-
clear in real coreference resolution tasks. Yang 
et al (2004) presented a learning-based approach 
by incorporating several S-list model-based fea-
tures to improve the performance in pronoun 
resolution. It shows that, although including S-
list model-based features can slightly boost the 
performance in the ideal case (i.e. given the cor-
rect antecedents of anaphor’s candidates), it de-
teriorates the overall performance in F-measure 
with slightly higher precision but much lower 
recall, in real cases, where the antecedents of 
anaphor’s candidates are determined automati-
cally by a separate coreference resolution mod-
ule.  
2.2 Semantic Information 
It is well known that semantic information plays 
a critical role in coreference resolution. Besides 
the common practice of employing a thesaurus 
(e.g. WordNet) in semantic consistency check-
ing, much research has been done to explore 
various kinds of semantic information, such as 
semantic similarity (Harabagiu et al 2000), se-
mantic compatibility (Yang et al 2005, 2007), 
and semantic class information (Soon et al 2001; 
Ng 2007). Although these methods have been 
proven useful in coreference resolution, their 
contributions are much limited. For example, Ng 
(2007) showed that semantic similarity informa-
tion and semantic agreement information could 
only improve the performance of coreference 
resolution by 0.6 and 0.5 in F-measure respec-
tively, on the ACE 2003 NWIRE corpus.

 3 Centering Theory 
The centering theory is a theory about the local 
discourse structure that models the interaction of 
referential continuity and the salience of dis-
course entities in the internal organization of a 
text. In natural languages, a given entity may be 
referred by different expressions and act as dif-
ferent grammatical roles throughout a text. For 
example, people often use pronouns to refer to 
the main subject of the discourse in focus, which 
can change over different portions of the dis-
course. One main goal of the centering theory is 
to track the focus entities throughout a text.  
The main claims of the centering theory can 
be formalized in terms of Cb (the backward-
looking center), Cf (a list of forward-looking 
centers for each utterance Un) and Cp (the pre-
ferred center, i.e. the most salient candidate for 
subsequent utterances). Given following two 
sentences: 1) Susani gave Betsyj a pet hamsterk; 
2) Shei reminded herj that such hamstersk were 
quite shy. We can have Ub, Uf and Up as follows: 
Ub= “Susan”; Uf={“Susan”, “Betsy”, “a pet 
hamster”}; Up= “Susan”. 
 Cb(Un)=Cb(Un-1)  or Cb(Un-1) undefined
Cb(Un)?Cb(Un-1)
Cb(Un)=Cp(Un) Continue Smooth Shift
Cb(Un)?Cp(Un) Retain Rough Shift
Table 1: Transitions in the centering theory 
Constraints 
C1. There is precisely one Cb. 
C2. Every element of Cf(Un) must be realized in Un. 
C3. Cb(Un) is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Un-1) 
that is realized in Un. 
Rules 
R1. If some element of Cf(Un-1) is realized as a pro-
noun in Un, then so is Cb(Un). 
R2.Transitions have the descending preference order 
of “Continue > Retain > Smooth Shift > Rough 
Shift”. 
Table 2: Constraints and rules in the centering theory 
Furthermore, several kinds of focus transi-
tions are defined in terms of two tests: whether 
Cb stays the same (i.e. Cb(Un+1)=Cb(Un)), and 
whether Cb is realized as the most prominent 
referring expression (i.e. Cb(Un=Cp(Un)). We 
refer to the first test as cohesion, and the second 
test as salience. Therefore, there are four possi-
ble combinations, which are displayed in Table 
1 and can result in four kinds of transitions, 
namely Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and 
Rough Shift. Obviously, salience, which chooses 
a proper verb form to make Cb prominent within 
a clause or sentence, is an important matter for 
sentence planning, while cohesion, which orders 
propositions in a text to maintain referential con-
tinuity, is an important matter for text planning.  
Finally, the centering theory imposes several 
constraints and rules over Cb/Cf and above tran-
sitions, as shown in Table 2. 
Given the centering theory as described above, 
we can draw the following conclusions: 
1) The centering theory is discourse-related and 
centers are discourse constructs.   
2) The backward-looking center Cb of Un de-
pends only on the expressions that constitute 
the utterance. That is, it is independent of its 
surface position and grammatical roles. 
Moreover, it is not constrained by any previ-
ous utterance in the segment. While the ele-
ments of Cf(Un) are partially ordered to 
reflect relative prominence in Un, grammati-
cal role information is often a major determi-
nant in ranking Cf, e.g. in the descending 
priority order of “Subject > Object > Others” 
in English (Grosz and Joshi, 2001).  
3) Psychological research (Gordon et al. 1993) 
and cross-linguistic research (Kameyama 
1986, 1988; Walker et al. 1990,1994) have 
validated that Cb is preferentially realized by 
a pronoun in English.  
4) Frequent rough shifts would lead to a lack of 
local cohesion. To keep local cohesion, peo-
ple tend to plan ahead and minimize the 
number of focus shifts. 
In this paper, we extend the centering theory 
from the grammatical level to the semantic level 
in attempt to better model the continuity or shift 
in the local discourse focus and improve the per-
formance of pronoun resolution via centering-
motivated semantic role features. 
4 Employing Centering Theory from  
Semantic Perspective 
In this section, we discuss how to employ the 
centering theory in pronoun resolution from the 
semantic perspective. In Subsection 4.1, we in-
troduce the semantic roles. In Subsection 4.2, we 
introduce how to employ the centering theory in 
pronoun resolution via semantic role features. 
Finally we compare our method with the previ-
ous work in Subsection 4.3. 
4.1 Semantic Role 
A semantic role is the underlying relationship 
that a participant has with a given predicate in a 
clause, i.e. the actual role a participant plays in 
989
 an event, apart from linguistic encoding of the 
situation. If, in some situation, someone named 
“John” purposely hits someone named “Bill”, 
then “John” is the agent and “Bill” is the patient 
of the hitting event. Therefore, given the predi-
cate “hit” in both of the following sentences, 
“John” has the same semantic role of agent and 
“Bill” has the same semantic role of patient: 1) 
John hit Bill. 2) Bill was hit by John.  
In the literature, labeling of such semantic 
roles has been well defined by the SRL (Seman-
tic Role Labeling) task, which first identifies the 
arguments of a given predicate and then assigns 
them appropriate semantic roles. During the last 
few years, there has been growing interest in 
SRL. For example, CoNLL 2004 and 2005 have 
made this problem a well-known shared task. 
However, there is still little consensus in the lin-
guistic and NLP communities about what set of 
semantic role labels are most appropriate. Typi-
cal semantic roles include core roles, such as 
agent, patient, instrument, and adjunct roles 
(such as locative, temporal, manner, and cause). 
For core roles, only agent and patient are consis-
tently defined across different predicates, e.g. in 
the popular PropBank (Palmer et al. 2005) and 
the derived version evaluated in the CoNLL 
2004 and 2005 shared tasks, as ARG0 and 
ARG1.  
In this paper, we extend the centering theory 
from the grammatical level to the semantic level 
for its better application in pronoun resolution 
via proper semantic role features due to three 
reasons:  
Sentence Grammatical Role Semantic Role
Bob opened the 
door with a key. 
Bob:  
SUBJECT 
Bob:  
AGENT 
The key opened 
the door. 
The key: 
SUBJECT 
The key : 
INSTRUMENT
The door opened. The door: 
SUBJECT 
The door: 
PATIENT 
Table 3: Relationship between grammatical roles and 
semantic roles: an example 
1) Semantic roles are conceptual notions, 
whereas grammatical roles are morph-
syntactic. While the original centering theory 
mainly builds from the grammatical perspec-
tive and grammatical roles do not always cor-
respond directly to semantic roles (Table 3 
shows an example of various semantic roles 
which a subject can play), there is a close re-
lationship between semantic roles and gram-
matical roles. The statistics in the CoNLL 
2004 and 2005 shared tasks (Shen and Lapata, 
2007) shows that the semantic roles of 
ARG0/agent and ARG1/patient account for 
85% of all arguments and most likely act as 
the centers of the local focus structure in dis-
course due to the close relationship between 
subject/object and agent/patient. Therefore, it 
is appropriate to model the centers of an ut-
terance from the semantic perspective via 
semantic roles. 
2) In a sense, semantic roles imply the informa-
tion of grammatical roles, especially for sub-
ject/object. For example, the position of an 
argument and the voice of the predicate verb 
play a central role in SRL. In intuition, an ar-
gument, which occurs before an active verb 
and has the semantic role of Arg0/agent, 
tends to be a subject. That is to say, semantic 
roles (e.g. Arg0/agent and Arg1/patient) can 
be mapped into their corresponding gram-
matical roles (e.g. subject and object), using 
some heuristic rules. Therefore, it would be 
interesting to represent the centers of the ut-
terances and employ the centering theory 
from the semantic perspective. 
3) Semantic role labeling has been well studied 
in the literature and there are good ready-to-
use toolkits available. For example, Pradhan 
(2005) achieved 82.2 in F-measure on the 
CoNLL 2005 version of the Propbank. In 
contrast, the research on grammatical role la-
beling is much less with the much lower 
state-of-the-art performance of 71.2 in F-
measure (Buchholz, 1999). Therefore, it may 
be better to explore the centering theory from 
the semantic perspective. 
4.2 Designing Centering-motivated Fea-
tures from  Semantic Perspective 
In this paper, the centering theory is employed in 
pronoun resolution via three kinds of centering-
motivated features: 
1) Semantic role features. They are achieved by 
checking possible semantic roles of referring 
expressions with regard to various predicates 
in a sentence. Due to the close relationship 
between subject/object and agent/patient, se-
mantic role information should be also a ma-
jor determinant in deciding the center of an 
utterance, which is likely to be the antecedent 
of a referring expression in the descending 
priority order of “Agent > Patient > Others” 
with regard to their semantic roles, corre-
sponding to the descending priority order of 
“Subject > Object > Others” with regard to 
their grammatical roles. 
990
 2) Relative pronominal ranking feature. Due to 
the predominance of pronouns in tracking the 
local discourse structure1, the relative rank-
ing of a pronoun among all the pronouns in a 
sentence should be useful in pronoun resolu-
tion. This is realized in this paper according 
to its semantic roles (with regard to various 
predicates in a sentence) and surface position 
(in a left-to-right order) by mapping each 
pronoun into 5 levels: a) rank 1 for pronouns 
with semantic role ARG0/agent of the main 
predicate; b) rank 2 for pronouns with seman-
tic role ARG1/patient of the main predicate; c) 
rank 3 for pronouns with semantic role 
ARG0/agent of other predicates; d) rank 4 for 
pronouns with semantic role ARG1/patient of 
other predicates; e) rank 5 for remaining pro-
nouns. Furthermore, for those pronouns with 
the same ranking level, they are ordered ac-
cording to their surface positions in a left-to-
right order, motivated by previous research 
on the centering theory (Grosz et al. 1995). 
3) Detailed pronominal subcategory features. 
Given a pronominal expression, its detailed 
pronominal subcategory features, such as 
whether it is a first person pronoun, second 
person pronoun, third person pronoun, neuter 
pronoun or others, are explored to enhance 
the discriminative power of both the semantic 
role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature, considering the predominant 
importance of pronouns in tracking the local 
focus structure in discourse.  
4.3 Comparison with Previous Work 
As a representative in explicitly employing se-
mantic role labeling in coreference resolution, 
Ponzetto and Strube (2006) explored two seman-
tic role features to capture the predicate-
argument structure information to benefit 
coreference resolution: I_SEMROLE, the predi-
cate-argument pairs of one referring expression, 
and J_SEMROLE, the predicate-argument pairs 
of another referring expression. Their experi-
ments on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that, 
while the two semantic role features much im-
prove the performance of common noun resolu-
tion by 3.8 and 2.7 in F-measure on the BNEWS 
and NWIRE domains respectively, they only 
                                                          
1 According to the centering theory, the backward-looking 
center Cb is preferentially realized by a pronoun in the sub-
ject position in natural languages, such as English, and 
people tend to plan ahead and minimize the number of 
focus shifts. 
slightly improve the performance of pronoun 
resolution by 0.4 and 0.3 in F-measure on the 
BNEWS and NWIRE domains respectively.  
In comparison, this paper proposes various 
kinds of centering-motivated semantic role fea-
tures in attempt to better model the continuity or 
shift in the local discourse focus by extending 
the centering theory from the grammatical level 
to the semantic level. For example, the 
CAARG0MainVerb feature (as shown in Table 
5) is designed to capture the semantic role of the 
antecedent candidate in the main predicate in 
modeling the discourse center, while, the AN-
PronounRanking feature (as shown in Table 5) is 
designed to determinate the relative priority of 
the pronominal anaphor in retaining the dis-
course center.  
Although both this paper and Ponzetto and 
Strube (2006) employs semantic role features, 
their ways of deriving such features are much 
different due to different driving 
forces/motivations behind. As a result, their con-
tributions on coreference resolution are different: 
while the semantic role features in Ponzette and 
Strube (2006) captures the predicate-argument 
structure information and contributes much to 
common noun resolution and their contribution 
on pronoun resolution can be ignored, the cen-
tering-motivated semantic role features in this 
paper contribute much in pronoun resolution. 
This justifies our attempt to better model the 
continuity or shift of the discourse focus in pro-
noun resolution by extending the centering the-
ory from the grammatical level to the semantic 
level and employing the centering-motivated 
features in pronoun resolution.. 
5 Experimentation and Discussion 
We have evaluated our approach of employing 
the centering theory in pronoun resolution from 
the semantic perspective on the ACE 2003 cor-
pus. 
5.1 Experimental Setting 
The ACE 2003 corpus contains three domains: 
newswire (NWIRE), newspaper (NPAPER), and 
broadcast news (BNEWS). For each domain, 
there exist two data sets, training and devtest, 
which are used for training and testing respec-
tively. Table 4 lists the pronoun distributions 
with coreferential relationships in the training 
data and the test data over pronominal subcate-
gories and sentence distances. Table 4(a) shows 
that third person pronouns occupy most and neu-
991
 tral pronouns occupy second while Table 4(b) 
shows that the antecedents of most pronouns 
occur within the current sentence and the previ-
ous sentence, with a little exception in the test 
data set of BNEWS.

Table 4: Pronoun statistics on the ACE 2003 corpus 
For preparation, all the documents in the cor-
pus are preprocessed automatically using a pipe-
line of NLP components, including tokenization 
and sentence segmentation, named entity recog-
nition, part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase 
chunking. Among them, named entity recogni-
tion, part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase 
chunking apply the same Hidden Markov Model 
(HMM)-based engine with error-driven learning 
capability (Zhou and Su, 2000 & 2002). In par-
ticular for SRL, we use a state-of-the-art in-
house toolkit, which achieved the precision of 
87.07% for ARG0 identification and the preci-
sion of 78.97% for ARG1 identification, for easy 
integration. In addition, we use the SVM-light2 
toolkit with the radial basis kernel and default 
learning parameters. Finally, we report the per-
formance in terms of recall, precision, and F-
measure, where precision measures the percent-
age of correctly-resolved pronouns (i.e. correctly 
linked with any referring expression in the 
coreferential chain), recall measures the cover-
age of correctly-resolved pronouns, and F-
measure gives an overall figure on equal har-
mony between precision and recall. To see 
whether an improvement is significant, we also 
conduct significance testing using paired t-test. 
In this paper, ‘>>>’, ‘>>’ and ‘>’ denote p-
values of an improvement smaller than 0.01, in-
between (0.01, 0,05] and bigger than 0.05,

which mean significantly better, moderately 
better and slightly better, respectively. 
5.2 Experimental Results 
Table 5 details various centering-motivated fea-
tures from the semantic perspective, which are 
incorporated in our final system. For example, 
the CAARG0MainVerb feature is designed to 
capture the semantic role of the antecedent can-
didate in the main predicate in modeling the dis-
course center, while the ANPronounRanking 
feature is designed to determinate the relative 
priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining 
the discourse center. As the baseline, we dupli-
cated the representative system with the same set 
of 12 basic features, as described in Soon et al 
(2001). Table 6 shows that our baseline system 
achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 62.3, 
65.3 and 59.0 in F-measure on the NWIRE, 
NPAPER and BNEWS domains, respectively. It 
also shows that the centering-motivated features 
(from the semantic perspective) significantly 
improve the F-measure by 3.6(>>>), 4.5(>>>) 
and 7.7(>>>) on the NWIRE, NPAPER and 
BNEWS domains, respectively. This justifies 
our attempt to model the continuity or shift of 
the discourse focus in pronoun resolution via 
centering-motivated features from the semantic 
perspective. For comparison, we also evaluate 
the performance of our final system from the 
grammatical perspective. This is done by replac-
ing semantic roles with grammatical roles in 
deriving centering-motivated features. Here, la-
beling of grammatical roles is achieved using a 
state-of-the-art toolkit, as described in Buchholz 
(1999). Table 6 shows that properly employing 
the centering theory in pronoun resolution from 
the grammatical perspective can also improve 
the performance. However, the performance im-
provement of employing the centering theory 
from the grammatical perspective is much lower, 
compared with that from the semantic perspec-
tive. This validates our attempt of employing the 
centering theory in pronoun resolution from the 
semantic perspective instead of from the gram-
matical perspective. This also suggests the great 
potential of applying the centering theory in 
pronoun resolution since the centering theory is 
a local coherence theory, which tells how subse-
quent utterances in a text link together.  
Table 7 shows the contribution of the seman-
tic role features and the relative pronominal 
ranking feature in pronoun resolution when the 
detailed pronominal subcategory features are 
included:

Table 7: Contribution of the semantic role features (SR) and the relative pronominal ranking feature (PR) in pro-
noun resolution when the detailed pronominal subcategory features are included 
1) The inclusion of the semantic role features 
improve the performance by 4.0(>>>), 
4.6(>>>) and 7.3(>>>) in F-measure on the 
NWIRE, NPAPER and BNEWS domains, re-
spectively. This suggests the impact of se-
mantic role information in determining the 
local discourse focus.  Since pronouns prefer-
entially occur in the subject position and tend 
to refer to the main subject (Ehrlich 1980; 
Brennan 1995; Walker et al. 1998; Cahn 
1995; Gordon and Searce 1995; Kibble et al. 
2001), this paper only applies semantic fea-
tures related with the semantic role of 
ARG0/agent, which is closely related with 
the grammatical role of subject, with regard 
to various predicates in a sentence. We have 
also explored features related with other se-
mantic roles. However, our preliminary ex-
perimentation shows that they do not improve 
the performance, even for ARG1/patient, and 
thus are not included in the final system. This 
may be due to that other semantic roles are 
not discriminative enough to make a differ-
ence in deciding the local discourse structure. 
2) It is surprising to notice that further inclusion 
of the relative pronominal ranking feature has 
only slight impact (slight positive impact on 
the BNEWS domain and slight negative im-
pact on the NWIRE and NPAPER domains) 
on the ACE 2003 corpus. This suggests that 
most of information in the relative pronomi-
nal ranking feature has been covered by the 
semantic role features. This is not surprising 
since the semantic role of ARG0/agent, 
which is explored to derive the semantic role 
features, is also applied to decide the relative 
pronominal ranking feature.  
The inclusion of the relative pronominal 
ranking feature improve the performance by 
1.1(>>>), 3.0(>>>) and 5.5(>>>) in F-measure. 
Our further evaluation reveals that the perform-
ance improvement difference among different 
domains of the ACE 2003 corpus is due to the 
distribution of pronouns’ antecedents occurring 
over different sentence distances, as shown in 
993
 Table 4. This suggests the usefulness of the rela-
tive pronominal ranking feature in resolving 
pronominal anaphors over longer distance. This 
is consistent with our observation that, as the 
percentage of pronominal anaphors referring to 
more distant antecedents increase, its impact 
turns gradually from negative to positive, when 
further including the relative pronominal ranking 
feature after the semantic role features. The rea-
son that we include the detailed pronominal sub-
category information is due to predominant 
importance of pronouns in tracking the local 
focus structure in discourse and that such de-
tailed pronominal subcategory information is 
discriminative in tracking different subcatego-
ries of pronouns. This suggests the usefulness of 
considering the distribution of the local dis-
course focus over detailed pronominal subcate-
gories. One interesting finding in our 
preliminary experimentation is that the inclusion 
of the detailed pronominal subcategory features 
alone even harms the performance. This may be 
due to the reason that the detailed pronominal 
subcategory features do not have the discrimina-
tive power themselves and that the semantic role 
features and the relative pronominal ranking fea-
ture provide an effective mechanism to explore 
the role of such detailed pronominal subcategory 
features in helping determine the local discourse 
focus.

Table 8: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu-
tion in F-measure over pronoun subcategories 
Table 8 shows the contribution of the center-
ing-motivated features over different pronoun 
subcategories. It shows that the centering-
motivated features contribute much to the reso-
lution of the four major pronoun subcategories 
(i.e. first person, second person, third person and 
neuter) while its negative impact on the minor 
pronoun subcategories (e.g. reflexive) can be 
ignored due to their much less frequent occur-
rence in the corpus.  In particular, the centering-
motivated features improve the performance on 
the major three pronoun subcategories of third 
person / neuter / first person, by 
8.3(>>>)/6.8(>>>)/9.0(>>>), 0.9(>>)/ 2.6 
(>>>)/11.1(>>>) and 4.7(>>>)/8.1(>>>)/9.0

domains of the ACE 2003 corpus, respectively.

Table 9: Performance comparison of pronoun resolu-
tion in F-measure over sentence distances 
Table 9 shows the contribution of the center-
ing-motivated features over different sentence 
distances. It shows that the centering-motivated 
features improve the performance of pronoun 
resolution on different sentence distances of 
0/1/2, by 2.7(>>>) / 5.8(>>>) / 10.0 (>>>), 
6.4(>>>) / 4.8(>>>) / 12.5(>>>) and 3.7 
(>>>)/4.4(>>>)/8.1(>>>), on the NWIRE, 
NPAPER and BNEWS domains of the ACE 
2003 corpus, respectively. This suggests that the 
centering-motivated features are helpful for both 
intra-sentential and inter-sentential pronoun 
resolution. 
6 Conclusion and Further Work 
This paper extends the centering theory from the 
grammatical level to the semantic level and 
much improves the performance of pronoun 
resolution via centering-motivated features from 
the semantic perspective. This is mainly realized 
by employing various semantic role features 
with regard to various predicates in a sentence, 
in attempt to model the continuity or shift of the 
local discourse focus. Moreover, the relative 
ranking feature of a pronoun among all the pro-
nouns is explored to help determine the relative 
priority of the pronominal anaphor in retaining 
the local discourse focus. Evaluation on the 
ACE 2003 corpus shows that both the centering-
motivated semantic role features and pronominal 
ranking feature much improve the performance 
of pronoun resolution, especially when the de-
tailed pronominal subcategory features of both 
the anaphor and the antecedent candidate are 
included. It is not surprising due to the predomi-
994
 nance of pronouns in tracking the local discourse 
structure in a text.   
To our best knowledge, this paper is the first 
research which successfully applies the center-
ing-motivated features in pronoun resolution 
from the semantic perspective. 
For future work, we will explore more kinds 
of semantic information and structured syntactic 
information in pronoun resolution. In particular, 
we will further employ the centering theory in 
pronoun resolution from both grammatical and 
semantic perspectives on more corpora.
