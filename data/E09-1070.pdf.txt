Abstract
Named entity recognition (NER) for En-
glish typically involves one of three gold
standards: MUC, CoNLL, or BBN, all created
by costly manual annotation. Recent work
has used Wikipedia to automatically cre-
ate a massive corpus of named entity an-
notated text.
We present the first comprehensive cross-
corpus evaluation of NER. We identify
the causes of poor cross-corpus perfor-
mance and demonstrate ways of making
them more compatible. Using our process,
we develop a Wikipedia corpus which out-
performs gold standard corpora on cross-
corpus evaluation by up to 11%.
1 Introduction
Named Entity Recognition (NER), the task of iden-
tifying and classifying the names of people, organ-
isations and other entities within text, is central
to many NLP systems. NER developed from in-
formation extraction in the Message Understand-
ing Conferences (MUC) of the 1990s. By MUC 6
and 7, NER had become a distinct task: tagging
proper names, and temporal and numerical expres-
sions (Chinchor, 1998).
Statistical machine learning systems have
proven successful for NER. These learn patterns
associated with individual entity classes, mak-
ing use of many contextual, orthographic, linguis-
tic and external knowledge features. However,
they rely heavily on large annotated training cor-
pora. This need for costly expert annotation hin-
ders the creation of more task-adaptable, high-
performance named entity recognisers.
In acquiring new sources for annotated corpora,
we require an analysis of training data as a variable
in NER. This paper compares the three main gold-
standard corpora. We found that tagging mod-
els built on each corpus perform relatively poorly
when tested on the others. We therefore present
three methods for analysing internal and inter-
corpus inconsistencies. Our analysis demonstrates
that seemingly minor variations in the text itself,
starting right from tokenisation can have a huge
impact on practical NER performance.
We take this experience and apply it to a corpus
created automatically using Wikipedia. This cor-
pus was created following the method of Nothman
et al. (2008). By training the C&C tagger (Curran
and Clark, 2003) on the gold-standard corpora and
our new Wikipedia-derived training data, we eval-
uate the usefulness of the latter and explore the
nature of the training corpus as a variable in NER.
Our Wikipedia-derived corpora exceed the per-
formance of non-corresponding training and test
sets by up to 11% F -score, and can be engineered
to automatically produce models consistent with
various NE-annotation schema. We show that it is
possible to automatically create large, free, named
entity-annotated corpora for general or domain
specific tasks.
2 NER and annotated corpora
Research into NER has rarely considered the im-
pact of training corpora. The CoNLL evalua-
tions focused on machine learning methods (Tjong
Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meul-
der, 2003) while more recent work has often in-
volved the use of external knowledge. Since many
tagging systems utilise gazetteers of known enti-
ties, some research has focused on their automatic
extraction from the web (Etzioni et al., 2005) or
Wikipedia (Toral et al., 2008), although Mikheev
et al. (1999) and others have shown that larger
NE lists do not necessarily correspond to increased
NER performance. Nadeau et al. (2006) use such
lists in an unsupervised NE recogniser, outper-
forming some entrants of the MUC Named Entity
Task. Unlike statistical approaches which learn
612
patterns associated with a particular type of entity,
these unsupervised approaches are limited to iden-
tifying common entities present in lists or those
caught by hand-built rules.
External knowledge has also been used to aug-
ment supervised NER approaches. Kazama and
Torisawa (2007) improve their F -score by 3% by
including a Wikipedia-based feature in their ma-
chine learner. Such approaches are limited by the
gold-standard data already available.
Less common is the automatic creation of train-
ing data. An et al. (2003) extracted sentences con-
taining listed entities from the web, and produced
a 1.8 million word Korean corpus that gave sim-
ilar results to manually-annotated training data.
Richman and Schone (2008) used a method sim-
ilar to Nothman et al. (2008) in order to derive
NE-annotated corpora in languages other than En-
glish. They classify Wikipedia articles in foreign
languages by transferring knowledge from English
Wikipedia via inter-language links. With these
classifications they automatically annotate entire
articles for NER training, and suggest that their re-
sults with a 340k-word Spanish corpus are compa-
rable to 20k-40k words of gold-standard training
data when using MUC-style evaluation metrics.
2.1 Gold-standard corpora
We evaluate our Wikipedia-derived corpora
against three sets of manually-annotated data from
(a) the MUC-7 Named Entity Task (MUC, 2001);
(b) the English CoNLL-03 Shared Task (Tjong
Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003); (c) the
BBN Pronoun Coreference and Entity Type
Corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005). We
consider only the generic newswire NER task,
although domain-specific annotated corpora have
been developed for applications such as bio-text
mining (Kim et al., 2003).
Stylistic and genre differences between the
source texts affect compatibility for NER evalua-
tion e.g., the CoNLL corpus formats headlines in
all-caps, and includes non-sentential data such as
tables of sports scores.
Each corpus uses a different set of entity labels.
MUC marks locations (LOC), organisations (ORG)
and personal names (PER), in addition to numeri-
cal and time information. The CoNLL NER shared
tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang
and De Meulder, 2003) mark PER, ORG and LOC
entities, as well as a broad miscellaneous class

BBN 54 901894 142218 129654
Table 1: Gold-standard NE-annotated corpora
(MISC; e.g. events, artworks and nationalities).
BBN annotates the entire Penn Treebank corpus
with 105 fine-grained tags (Brunstein, 2002): 54
corresponding to CoNLL entities; 21 for numeri-
cal and time data; and 30 for other classes. For
our evaluation, BBN’s tags were reduced to the
equivalent CoNLL tags, with extra tags in the BBN
and MUC data removed. Since no MISC tags are
marked in MUC, they need to be removed from
CoNLL, BBN and Wikipedia data for comparison.
We transformed all three corpora into a com-
mon format and annotated them with part-of-
speech tags using the Penn Treebank-trained
C&C POS tagger. We altered the default MUC
tokenisation to attach periods to abbreviations
when sentence-internal. While standard training
(TRAIN), development (DEV) and final test (TEST)
set divisions were available for CoNLL and MUC,
the BBN corpus was split at our discretion: sec-
tions 03–21 for TRAIN, 00–02 for DEV and 22-24
for TEST. Corpus sizes are compared in Table 1.
2.2 Evaluating NER performance
One challenge for NER research is establishing an
appropriate evaluation metric (Nadeau and Sekine,
2007). In particular, entities may be correctly
delimited but mis-classified, or entity boundaries
may be mismatched.
MUC (Chinchor, 1998) awarded equal score for
matching type, where an entity’s class is identi-
fied with at least one boundary matching, and text,
where an entity’s boundaries are precisely delim-
ited, irrespective of the classification. This equal
weighting is unrealistic, as some boundary errors
are highly significant, while others are arbitrary.
CoNLL awarded exact (type and text) phrasal
matches, ignoring boundary issues entirely and
providing a lower-bound measure of NER per-
formance. Manning (2006) argues that CoNLL-
style evaluation is biased towards systems which
leave entities with ambiguous boundaries un-
tagged, since boundary errors amount simultane-
ously to false positives and false negatives. In both
MUC and CoNLL, micro-averaged precision, recall
and F1 score summarise the results.
613
Tsai et al. (2006) compares a number of meth-
ods for relaxing boundary requirements: matching
only the left or right boundary, any tag overlap,
per-token measures, or more semantically-driven
matching. ACE evaluations instead use a customiz-
able evaluation metric with weights specified for
different types of error (NIST-ACE, 2008).
3 Corpus and error analysis approaches
To evaluate the performance impact of a corpus
we may analyse (a) the annotations themselves; or
(b) the model built on those annotations and its
performance. A corpus can be considered in isola-
tion or by comparison with other corpora. We use
three methods to explore intra- and inter-corpus
consistency in MUC, CoNLL, and BBN in Section 4.
3.1 N-gram tag variation
Dickinson and Meurers (2003) present a clever
method for finding inconsistencies within POS an-
notated corpora, which we apply to NER corpora.
Their approach finds all n-grams in a corpus which
appear multiple times, albeit with variant tags for
some sub-sequence, the nucleus (see e.g. Table
3). To remove valid ambiguity, they suggest us-
ing (a) a minimum n-gram length; (b) a minimum
margin of invariant terms around the nucleus.
For example, the BBN TRAIN corpus includes
eight occurrences of the 6-gram the San Francisco
Bay area ,. Six instances of area are tagged as non-
entities, but two instances are tagged as part of the
LOC that precedes it. The other five tokens in this
n-gram are consistently labelled.
3.2 Entity type frequency
An intuitive approach to finding discrepancies be-
tween corpora is to compare the distribution of en-
tities within each corpus. To make this manage-
able, instances need to be grouped by more than
their class labels. We used the following groups:
POS sequences: Types of candidate entities may
often be distinguished by their POS tags, e.g.
nationalities are often JJ or NNPS.
Wordtypes: Collins (2002) proposed wordtypes
where all uppercase characters map to A, low-
ercase to a, and digits to 0. Adjacent charac-
ters in the same orthographic class were col-
lapsed. However, we distinguish single from
multiple characters by duplication. e.g. USS
Nimitz (CVN-68) has wordtype AA Aaa (AA-00).
Wordtype with functions: We also map content
words to wordtypes only—function words
are retained, e.g. Bank of New England Corp.
maps to Aaa of Aaa Aaa Aaa..
No approach provides sufficient discrimination
alone: wordtype patterns are able to distinguish
within common POS tags and vice versa. Each
method can be further simplified by merging re-
peated tokens, NNP NNP becoming NNP.
By calculating the distribution of entities over
these groupings, we can find anomalies between
corpora. For instance, 4% of MUC’s and 5.9%
of BBN’s PER entities have wordtype Aaa A. Aaa,
e.g. David S. Black, while CoNLL has only 0.05% of
PERs like this. Instead, CoNLL has many names of
form A. Aaa, e.g. S. Waugh, while BBN and MUC
have none. We can therefore predict incompatibil-
ities between systems trained on BBN and evalu-
ated on CoNLL or vice-versa.
3.3 Tag sequence confusion
A confusion matrix between predicted and correct
classes is an effective method of error analysis.
For phrasal sequence tagging, this can be applied
to either exact boundary matches or on a per-token
basis, ignoring entity bounds. We instead compile
two matrices: C/P comparing correct entity classes
against predicted tag sequences; and P/C compar-
ing predicted classes to correct tag sequences.
C/P equates oversized boundaries to correct
matches, and tabulates cases of undersized bound-
aries. For example, if [ORG Johnson and Johnson] is
tagged [PER Johnson] and [PER Johnson], it is marked
in matrix coordinates (ORG, PER O PER). P/C em-
phasises oversized boundaries: if gold-standard
Mr. [PER Ross] is tagged PER, it is counted as con-
fusion between PER and O PER. To further dis-
tinguish classes of error, the entity type groupings
from Section 3.2 are also used.
This analysis is useful for both tagger evalua-
tion and cross-corpus evaluation, e.g. BBN versus
CoNLL on a BBN test set. This involves finding
confusion matrix entries where BBN and CoNLL’s
performance differs significantly, identifying com-
mon errors related to difficult instances in the test
corpus as well as errors in the NER model.
4 Comparing gold-standard corpora
We trained the C&C NER tagger (Curran and Clark,
2003) to build separate models for each gold-
standard corpus. The C&C tagger utilises a number

Table 2: Gold standard F -scores (exact-match)
of orthographic, contextual and in-document fea-
tures, as well as gazetteers for personal names. Ta-
ble 2 shows that each training set performs much
better on corresponding (same corpus) test sets
(italics) than on test sets from other sources, also
identified by (Ciaramita and Altun, 2005). NER
research typically deals with small improvements
(?1% F -score). The 12-32% mismatch between
training and test corpora suggests that an appropri-
ate training corpus is a much greater concern. The
exception is BBN on MUC, due to differing TEST
and DEV subject matter. Here we analyse the vari-
ation within and between the gold standards.
Table 3 lists some n-gram tag variations for BBN
and CoNLL (TRAIN + DEV). These include cases of
schematic variations (e.g. the period in Co .) and
tagging errors. Some n-grams have three variants,
e.g. the Standard & Poor ’s 500 which appears un-
tagged, as the [ORG Standard & Poor] ’s 500, or the
[ORG Standard & Poor ’s] 500. MUC is too small for
this method. CoNLL only provides only a few ex-
amples, echoing BBN in the ambiguities of trailing
periods and leading determiners or modifiers.
Wordtype distributions were also used to com-
pare the three gold standards. We investigated all
wordtypes which occur with at least twice the fre-
quency in one corpus as in another, if that word-
type was sufficiently frequent. Among the differ-
ences recovered from this analysis are:
• CoNLL has an over-representation of uppercase words
due to all-caps headlines.
• Since BBN also annotates common nouns, some have
been mistakenly labelled as proper-noun entities.
• BBN tags text like Munich-based as LOC; CoNLL
tags it as MISC; MUC separates the hyphen as a token.
• CoNLL is biased to sports and has many event names
in the form of 1990 World Cup.
• BBN separates organisation names from their products
as in [ORG Commodore] [MISC 64].
• CoNLL has few references to abbreviated US states.
• CoNLL marks conjunctions of people (e.g. Ruth and
Edwin Brooks) as a single PER entity.
• CoNLL text has Co Ltd instead of Co. Ltd.
We analysed the tag sequence confusion when
training with each corpus and testing on BBN DEV.
While full confusion matrices are too large for this
paper, Table 4 shows some examples where the
Figure 1: Deriving training data from Wikipedia
NER models disagree. MUC fails to correctly tag
U.K. and U.S.. U.K. only appears once in MUC, and
U.S. appears 22 times as ORG and 77 times as LOC.
CoNLL has only three instances of Mr., so it often
mis-labels Mr. as part of a PER entity. The MUC
model also has trouble recognising ORG names
ending with corporate abbreviations, and may fail
to identify abbreviated US state names.
Our analysis demonstrates that seemingly mi-
nor orthographic variations in the text, tokenisa-
tion and annotation schemes can have a huge im-
pact on practical NER performance.
5 From Wikipedia to NE-annotated text
Wikipedia is a collaborative, multilingual, online
encyclopedia which includes over 2.3 million arti-
cles in English alone. Our baseline approach de-
tailed in Nothman et al. (2008) exploits the hyper-
linking between articles to derive a NE corpus.
Since ?74% of Wikipedia articles describe top-
ics covering entity classes, many of Wikipedia’s
links correspond to entity annotations in gold-
standard NE corpora. We derive a NE-annotated
corpus by the following steps:
1. Classify all articles into entity classes
2. Split Wikipedia articles into sentences
3. Label NEs according to link targets
4. Select sentences for inclusion in a corpus

Table 4: Tag sequence confusion on BBN DEV when training on gold-standard corpora (no MISC)
In Figure 1, a sentence introducing Holden as an
Australian car maker based in Port Melbourne has
links to separate articles about each entity. Cues
in the linked article about Holden indicate that it is
an organisation, and the article on Port Melbourne
is likewise classified as a location. The original
sentence can then be automatically annotated with
these facts. We thus extract millions of sentences
from Wikipedia to form a new NER corpus.
We classify each article in a bootstrapping pro-
cess using its category head nouns, definitional
nouns from opening sentences, and title capital-
isation. Each article is classified as one of: un-
known; a member of a NE category (LOC, ORG,
PER, MISC, as per CoNLL); a disambiguation page
(these list possible referent articles for a given ti-
tle); or a non-entity (NON). This classifier classi-
fier achieves 89% F -score.
A sentence is selected for our corpus when all
of its capitalised words are linked to articles with a
known class. Exceptions are made for common ti-
tlecase words, e.g. I, Mr., June, and sentence-initial
words. We also infer additional links — variant ti-
tles are collected for each Wikipedia topic and are
marked up in articles which link to them — which
Nothman et al. (2008) found increases coverage.
Transforming links into annotations that con-
form to a gold standard is far from trivial. Link
boundaries need to be adjusted, e.g. to remove ex-
cess punctuation. Adjectival forms of entities (e.g.
American, Islamic) generally link to nominal arti-
cles. However, they are treated by CoNLL and our
N-gram Tag # Tag #

Chicago , Illinois - 8 LOC 3
the American and LOC 1 MISC 2
Table 5: N-gram variations in the Wiki baseline
BBN mapping as MISC. POS tagging the corpus and
relabelling entities ending with JJ as MISC solves
this heuristically. Although they are capitalised in
English, personal titles (e.g. Prime Minister) are not
typically considered entities. Initially we assume
that all links immediately preceding PER entities
are titles and delete their entity classification.
6 Improving Wikipedia performance
The baseline system described above achieves
only 58.9% and 62.3% on the CoNLL and
BBN TEST sets (exact-match scoring) with 3.5-
million training tokens. We apply methods pro-
posed in Section 3 to to identify and minimise
Wikipedia errors on the BBN DEV corpus.
We begin by considering Wikipedia’s internal
consistency using n-gram tag variation (Table 5).
The breadth of Wikipedia leads to greater genuine
ambiguity, e.g. Batman (a character or a comic
strip). It also shares gold-standard inconsistencies
like leading modifiers. Variations in American and
Chicago, Illinois indicate errors in adjectival entity
labels and in correcting link boundaries.
Some errors identified with tag sequence confu-
sion are listed in Table 6. These correspond to re-

Table 6: Tag sequence confusion on BBN DEV with training on BBN and the Wikipedia baseline
sults of an entity type frequency analysis and mo-
tivate many of our Wikipedia extensions presented
below. In particular, personal titles are tagged as
PER rather than unlabelled; plural nationalities are
tagged LOC, not MISC; LOCs hyphenated to fol-
lowing words are not identified; nor are abbrevi-
ated US state names. Using R. to abbreviate Re-
publican in BBN is also a high-frequency error.
6.1 Inference from disambiguation pages
Our baseline system infers extra links using a set
of alternative titles identified for each article. We
extract the alternatives from the article and redirect
titles, the text of all links to the article, and the first
and last word of the article title if it is labelled PER.
Our extension is to extract additional inferred ti-
tles fromWikipedia’s disambiguation pages. Most
disambiguation pages are structured as lists of ar-
ticles that are often referred to by the titleD being
disambiguated. For each link with target A that
appears at the start of a list item on D’s page, D
and its redirect aliases are added to the list of al-
ternative titles for A.
Our new source of alternative titles includes
acronyms and abbreviations (AMP links to AMP
Limited and Ampere), and given or family names
(Howard links to Howard Dean and John Howard).
6.2 Personal titles
Personal titles (e.g. Brig. Gen., Prime Minister-
elect) are capitalised in English. Titles are some-
times linked in Wikipedia, but the target articles,
e.g. U.S. President, are in Wikipedia categories like
Presidents of the United States, causing their incor-
rect classification as PER.
Our initial implementation assumed that links
immediately preceding PER entity links are titles.
While this feature improved performance, it only
captured one context for personal titles and failed
to handle instances where the title was only a
portion of the link text, such as Australian Prime
Minister-elect or Prime Minister of Australia.
To handle titles more comprehensively, we
compiled a list of the terms most frequently linked
immediately prior to PER links. These were man-
ually filtered, removing LOC or ORG mentions and
complemented with abbreviated titles extracted
from BBN, producing a list of 384 base title forms,
11 prefixes (e.g. Vice) and 3 suffixes (e.g. -elect).
Using these gazetteers, titles are stripped of erro-
neous NE tags.
6.3 Adjectival forms
In English, capitalisation is retained in adjectival
entity forms, such as American or Islamic. While
these are not exactly entities, both CoNLL and BBN
annotate them as MISC. Our baseline approach
POS tagged the corpus and marked all adjectival
entities as MISC. This missed instances where na-
tionalities are used nominally, e.g. five Italians.
We extracted 339 frequent LOC and ORG ref-
erences with POS tag JJ. Words from this list
(e.g. Italian) are relabelled MISC, irrespective of
POS tag or pluralisation (e.g. Italian/JJ, Italian/NNP,
Italian/NNPS). This unfiltered list includes some er-
rors from POS tagging, e.g. First, Emmy; and others
where MISC is rarely the appropriate tag, e.g. the
Democrats (an ORG).
6.4 Miscellaneous changes
Entity-word aliases Longest-string matching for
inferred links often adds redundant words, e.g.
both Australian and Australian people are redirects to
Australia. We therefore exclude from inference ti-
tles of form X Y where X is an alias of the same
article and Y is lowercase.
State abbreviations A gold standard may use
stylistic forms which are rare in Wikipedia. For
instance, the Wall Street Journal (BBN) uses US
state abbreviations, while Wikipedia nearly al-
ways refers to states in full. We boosted perfor-
mance by substituting a random selection of US
state names in Wikipedia with their abbreviations.

Table 7: Exact-match DEV F -scores
Removing rare cases We explicitly removed
sentences containing title abbreviations (e.g. Mr.)
appearing in non-PER entities such as movie titles.
Compared to newswire, these forms as personal
titles are rare in Wikipedia, so their appearance in
entities causes tagging errors. We used a similar
approach to personal names including of, which
also act as noise.
Fixing tokenization Hyphenation is a problem
in tokenisation: should London-based be one token,
two, or three? Both BBN and CoNLL treat it as one
token, but BBN labels it a LOC and CoNLL a MISC.
Our baseline had split hyphenated portions from
entities. Fixing this to match the BBN approach
improved performance significantly.
7 Experiments
We evaluated our annotation process by build-
ing separate NER models learned from Wikipedia-
derived and gold-standard data. Our results are
given as micro-averaged precision, recall and F -
scores both in terms of MUC-style and CoNLL-style
(exact-match) scoring. We evaluated all experi-
ments with and without the MISC category.
Wikipedia’s articles are freely available for
download.1 We have used data from the 2008
May 22 dump of English Wikipedia which in-
cludes 2.3 million articles. Splitting this into sen-
tences and tokenising produced 32 million sen-
tences each containing an average of 24 tokens.
Our experiments were performed with a
Wikipedia corpus of 3.5 million tokens. Although
we had up to 294 million tokens available, we
were limited by the RAM required by the C&C tag-
ger training software.

match and MUC-style evaluations (which are typi-
cally a few percent higher). The cross-corpus gold
standard experiments on the DEV sets are shown
first in both tables. As in Table 2, the performance
drops significantly when the training and test cor-
pus are from different sources. The corresponding
TEST set scores are given in Tables 9 and 10.
The second group of experiments in these ta-
bles show the performance of Wikipedia corpora
with increasing levels of link inference (described
in Section 6.1). Links inferred upon match-
ing article titles (WP1) and disambiguation ti-
tles (WP2) consistently increase F -score by ?5%,
while surnames for PER entities (WP3) and all link
texts (WP4) tend to introduce error. A key re-
sult of our work is that the performance of non-
corresponding gold standards is often significantly
exceeded by our Wikipedia training data.
Our third group of experiments combined our
Wikipedia corpora with gold-standard data to im-
prove performance beyond traditional train-test
pairs. Table 9 shows that this approach may lead

to small F -score increases.
Our per-class Wikipedia results are shown in
Table 13. LOC and PER entities are relatively easy
to identify, although a low precision for PER sug-
gests that many other entities have been marked
erroneously as people, unlike the high precision
and low recall of ORG. As an ill-defined category,
with uncertain mapping between BBN and CoNLL
classes, MISC precision is unsurprisingly low. We
also show results evaluating the correct labelling
of each token, where Nothman et al. (2008) had
reported results 13% higher than phrasal match-
ing, reflecting a failure to correctly identify entity
boundaries. We have reduced this difference to
9%. A BBN-trained model gives only 5% differ-
ence between phrasal and token F -score.
Among common tagging errors, we identified:
tags continuing over additional words as in New
York-based Loews Corp. all being marked as a sin-
gle ORG; nationalities marked as LOC rather than
MISC; White House a LOC rather than ORG, as
with many sports teams; single-word ORG entities
marked as PER; titles such as Dr. included in PER
tags; mis-labelling un-tagged title-case terms and
tagged lowercase terms in the gold-standard.
The corpus analysis methods described in
Section 3 show greater similarity between our
Wikipedia-derived corpus and BBN after imple-
menting our extensions. There is nonetheless
much scope for further analysis and improvement.
Notably, the most commonly mis-tagged tokens in
BBN (see Table 12) relate more often to individual
entities and stylistic differences than to a general-
isable class of errors.
9 Conclusion
We have demonstrated the enormous variability in
performance between using NER models trained
and tested on the same corpus versus tested on
other gold standards. This variability arises from
not only mismatched annotation schemes but also
stylistic conventions, tokenisation, and missing
frequent lexical items. Therefore, NER corpora
must be carefully matched to the target text for rea-
sonable performance. We demonstrate three ap-
proaches for gauging corpus and annotation mis-
match, and apply them to MUC, CoNLL and BBN,
and our automatically-derived Wikipedia corpora.
There is much room for improving the results of
our Wikipedia-based NE annotations. In particu-
lar, a more careful approach to link inference may
further reduce incorrect boundaries of tagged en-
tities. We plan to increase the largest training set
the C&C tagger can support so that we can fully
exploit the enormous Wikipedia corpus.
However, we have shown that Wikipedia can
be used a source of free annotated data for train-
ing NER systems. Although such corpora need
to be engineered specifically to a desired appli-
cation, Wikipedia’s breadth may permit the pro-
duction of large corpora even within specific do-
mains. Our results indicate that Wikipedia data
can perform better (up to 11% for CoNLL on MUC)
than training data that is not matched to the eval-
uation, and hence is widely applicable. Trans-
formingWikipedia into training data thus provides
a free and high-yield alternative to the laborious
manual annotation required for NER.
