Abstract
In this paper we present a human-based
evaluation of surface realisation alterna-
tives. We examine the relative rankings of
naturally occurring corpus sentences and
automatically generated strings chosen by
statistical models (language model, log-
linear model), as well as the naturalness of
the strings chosen by the log-linear model.
We also investigate to what extent preced-
ing context has an effect on choice. We
show that native speakers do accept quite
some variation in word order, but there are
also clearly factors that make certain real-
isation alternatives more natural.
1 Introduction
An important component of research on surface
realisation (the task of generating strings for a
given abstract representation) is evaluation, espe-
cially if we want to be able to compare across sys-
tems. There is consensus that exact match with
respect to an actually observed corpus sentence is
too strict a metric and that BLEU score measured
against corpus sentences can only give a rough im-
pression of the quality of the system output. It is
unclear, however, what kind of metric would be
most suitable for the evaluation of string realisa-
tions, so that, as a result, there have been a range of
automatic metrics applied including inter alia ex-
act match, string edit distance, NIST SSA, BLEU,
NIST, ROUGE, generation string accuracy, gener-
ation tree accuracy, word accuracy (Bangalore et
al., 2000; Callaway, 2003; Nakanishi et al., 2005;
Velldal and Oepen, 2006; Belz and Reiter, 2006).
It is not always clear how appropriate these met-
rics are, especially at the level of individual sen-
tences. Using automatic evaluation metrics cannot
be avoided, but ideally, a metric for the evaluation
of realisation rankers would rank alternative real-
isations in the same way as native speakers of the
language for which the surface realisation system
is developed, and not only globally, but also at the
level of individual sentences.
Another major consideration in evaluation is
what to take as the gold standard. The easiest op-
tion is to take the original corpus string that was
used to produce the abstract representation from
which we generate. However, there may well be
other realisations of the same input that are as
suitable in the given context. Reiter and Sripada
(2002) argue that while we should take advantage
of large corpora in NLG, we also need to take care
that we do not introduce errors by learning from
incorrect data present in corpora.
In order to better understand what makes good
evaluation data (and metrics), we designed and im-
plemented an experiment in which human judges
evaluated German string realisations. The main
aims of this experiment were: (i) to establish how
much variation in German word order is accept-
able for human judges, (ii) to find an automatic
evaluation metric that mirrors the findings of the
human evaluation, (iii) to provide detailed feed-
back for the designers of the surface realisation
ranking model and (iv) to establish what effect
preceding context has on the choice of realisation.
In this paper, we concentrate on points (i) and (iv).
The remainder of the paper is structured as fol-
lows: In Section 2 we outline the realisation rank-
ing system that provided the data for the experi-
ment. In Section 3 we outline the design of the
experiment and in Section 4 we present our find-
ings. In Section 5 we relate this to other work and
finally we conclude in Section 6.
2 A Realisation Ranking System for
German
We take the realisation ranking system for German
described in Cahill et al. (2007) and present the
output to human judges. One goal of this series
of experiments is to examine whether the results
112
based on automatic evaluation metrics published
in that paper are confirmed in an evaluation by hu-
mans. Another goal is to collect data that will al-
low us and other researchers1 to explore more fine-
grained and reliable automatic evaluation metrics
for realisation ranking.
The system presented by Cahill et al. (2007)
ranks the strings generated by a hand-crafted
broad-coverage Lexical Functional Grammar
(Bresnan, 2001) for German (Rohrer and Forst,
2006) on the basis of a given input f-structure.
In these experiments, we use f-structures from
their held-out and test sets, of which 96% can
be associated with surface realisations by the
grammar. F-structures are attribute-value ma-
trices representing grammatical functions and
morphosyntactic features; roughly speaking,
they are predicate-argument structures. In LFG,
f-structures are assumed to be a crosslinguistically
relatively parallel syntactic representation level,
alongside the more surface-oriented c-structures,
which are context-free trees. Figure 1 shows
the f-structure2 associated with TIGER Corpus
sentence 8609, glossed in (1), as well as the 4
string realisations that the German LFG generates
from this f-structure. The LFG is reversible,
i.e. the same grammar is used for parsing as for
generation. It is a hand-crafted grammar, and
has been carefully constructed to only parse (and
therefore generate) grammatical strings.3

The ranker consists of a log-linear model that
is based on linguistically informed structural fea-
tures as well as a trigram language model, whose

2Note that only grammatical functions are displayed;
morphosyntactic features are omitted due to space con-
straints. Also note that the discourse function TOPIC was
ignored in generation.
3A ranking mechanism based on so-called optimality
marks can lead to a certain ìasymmetryî between parsing and
generation in the sense that not all sentences that can be as-
sociated with a certain f-structure are necessarily generated
from this same f-structure. E.g. the sentence Williams war
a®uﬂerst umstritten in der britischen Politik. can be parsed
into the f-structure in Figure 1, but it is not generated because
an optimality mark penalizes the extraposition of PPs to the
right of a clause. Only few optimality marks were used in the
process of generating the data for our experiments, so that the
bias they introduce should not be too noticeable.
score is integrated into the model simply as an ad-
ditional feature. The log-linear model is trained on
corpus data, in this case sentences from the TIGER
Corpus (Brants et al., 2002), for which f-structures
are available; the observed corpus sentences are
considered as references whose probability is to
be maximised during the training process.
The output of the realisation ranker is evalu-
ated in terms of exact match and BLEU score,
both measured against the actually observed cor-
pus sentences. In addition to the figures achieved
by the ranker, the corresponding figures achieved
by the employed trigram language model on its
own are given as a baseline, and the exact match
figure of the best possible string selection is given
as an upper bound.4 We summarise these figures
in Table 1.
Exact Match BLEU score
Language model 27% 0.7306
Log-linear model 37% 0.7939
Upper bound 62% ñ
Table 1: Results achieved by trigram LM ranker
and log-linear model ranker in Cahill et al. (2007)
By means of these figures, Cahill et al. (2007)
show that a log-linear model based on structural
features and a language model score performs con-
siderably better realisation ranking than just a lan-
guage model. In our experiments, presented in de-
tail in the following section, we examine whether
human judges confirm this and how natural and/or
acceptable the selection performed by the realisa-
tion ranker under consideration is for German na-
tive speakers.
3 Experiment Design
The experiment was divided into three parts. Each
part took between 30 and 45 minutes to complete,
and participants were asked to leave some time
(e.g. a week) between each part. In total, 24 par-
ticipants completed the experiment. All were na-
tive German speakers (mostly from South-Western
Germany) and almost all had a linguistic back-
ground. Table 2 gives a breakdown of the items
in each part of the experiment.5
4The observed corpus sentence can be (re)generated from
the corresponding f-structure for only 62% of the sentences
used, usually because of differences in punctuation. Hence
this exact match upper bound. An upper bound in terms
of BLEU score cannot be computed because BLEU score is
computed on entire corpora rather than individual sentences.
5Experiments 3a and 3b contained the same items as ex-
periments 1a and 1b.

3.1 Part 1
The aim of part 1 of the experiment was twofold.
First, to identify the relative rankings of the sys-
tems evaluated in Cahill et al. (2007) according to
the human judges, and second to evaluate the qual-
ity of the strings as chosen by the log-linear model
of Cahill et al. (2007). To these ends, part 1 was
further subdivided into two tasks: 1a and b.
Task 1a: During the first task, participants were
presented with alternative realisations for an input
f-structure (but not shown the original f-structure)
and asked to rank them in order of how natural
sounding they were, 1 being the best and 3 be-
ing the worst.6 Each item contained three alter-
natives, (i) the original string found in TIGER, (ii)
the string chosen as most likely by the trigram lan-
guage model, and (iii) the string chosen as most
likely by the log-linear model. Only items where
each system chose a different alternative were cho-
sen from the evaluation data of Cahill et al. (2007).
The three alternatives were presented in random
order for each item, and the items were presented
in random order for each participant. Some items
were presented randomly to participants more than

were forced to make strict ranking decisions, and in hindsight
this may have introduced some noise into the data.
once as a sanity check, and in total for Part 1a, par-
ticipants made 52 ranking judgements on 44 items.
Figure 2 shows a screen shot of what the partici-
pant was presented with for this task.
Task 1b: In the second task of part 1, partic-
ipants were presented with the string chosen by
the log-linear model as being the most likely and
asked to evaluate it on a scale from 1 to 5 on how
natural sounding it was, 1 being very unnatural
or marked and 5 being completely natural. Fig-
ure 3 shows a screen shot of what the participant
saw during the experiment. Again some random
items were presented to the participant more than
once, and the items themselves were presented in
random order. In total, the participants made 58
judgements on 52 items.
3.2 Part 2
In the second part of the experiment, participants
were presented between 4 and 8 alternative sur-
face realisations for an input f-structure, as well
as some preceding context. This preceding con-
text was automatically determined using informa-
tion from the export release of the TIGER treebank
and was not hand-checked for relevance.7 The par-
ticipants were then asked to choose the realisation
that they felt fit best given the preceding sentences.
7The export release of the TIGER treebank includes an
article ID for each sentence. Unfortunately, this is not com-
pletely reliable for determining relevant context, since an ar-
ticle can also contain several short news snippets which are
completely unrelated. Paragraph boundaries are not marked.
This leads to some noise, which unfortunately is difficult to
measure objectively

Table 3: Task 1a: Ranks for each system
The items were presented in random order, and the
list of alternatives were presented in random order
to each participant. Some items were randomly
presented more than once, resulting in 50 judge-
ments on 41 items. Figure 4 shows a screen shot
of what the participant saw.
3.3 Part 3
Part 3 of the experiment was identical to Part 1,
except that now, rather than the participants being
presented with sentences in isolation, they were
given some preceding context. The context was
determined automatically, in the same way as in
Part 2. The items themselves were the same as in
Part 1. The aim of this part of the experiment was
to see what effect preceding context had on judge-
ments.
4 Results
In this section we present the result and analysis
of the experiments outlined above.
4.1 How good were the strings?
The data collected in Experiment 1a showed the
overall human relative ranking of the three sys-
tems. We calculate the total numbers of each
rank for each system. Table 3 summarises the re-
sults. The original string is the string found in the
Figure 5: Task 1b: Naturalness scores for strings
chosen by log-linear model, 1=worst
TIGER Corpus, the LM String is the string cho-
sen as being most likely by the trigram language
model and the LL String is the string chosen as
being most likely by the log-linear model.
Table 3 confirms the overall relative rankings
of the three systems as determined using BLEU
scores. The original TIGER strings are ranked best
(average 1.4), the strings chosen by the log-linear
model are ranked better than the strings chosen by
the language model (average 2.65 vs 2.04).
In Experiment 1b, the aim was to find out how
acceptable the strings chosen by the log-linear
model were, although they were not the same as
the original string. Figure 5 summarises the data.
The graph shows that the majority of strings cho-
sen by the log-linear model ranked very highly on
the naturalness scale.
4.2 Did the human judges agree with the
original authors?
In Experiment 2, the aim was to find out how of-
ten the human judges chose the same string as the
original author (given alternatives generated by the
LFG grammar). Most items had between 4 and 6
alternative strings. In 70% of all items, the human
judges chose the same string as the original au-
thor. However, the remaining 30% of the time, the
human judges picked an alternative as being the
115
Figure 4: Screenshot of Part 2 of the Experiment
most fitting in the given context.8 This suggests
that there is quite some variation in what native
German speakers will accept, but that this varia-
tion is by no means random, as indicated by 70%
of choices being the same string as the original au-
thorís.
Figure 6 shows for each bin of possible alterna-
tives, the percentage of items with a given num-
ber of choices made. For example, for the items
with 4 possible alternatives, over 70% of the time,
the judges chose between only 2 of them. For the
items with 5 possible alternatives, in 10% of those
items the human judges chose only 1 of those al-
ternatives; in 30% of cases, the human judges all
chose the same 2 solutions, and for the remain-
ing 60% they chose between only 3 of the 5 pos-
sible alternatives. These figures indicate that al-
though judges could not always agree on one best
string, often they were only choosing between 2 or
3 of the possible alternatives. This suggests that,
on the one hand, native speakers do accept quite
some variation, but that, on the other hand, there
are clearly factors that make certain realisation al-
ternatives more preferable than others.
Figure 6: Exp 2: Number of Alternatives Chosen
8Recall that almost all strings presented to the judges were
grammatical.
The graph in Figure 6 shows that only in two
cases did the human judges choose from among
all possible alternatives. In one case, there were 4
possible alternatives and in the other 6. The origi-
nal sentence that had 4 alternatives is given in (2).
The four alternatives that participants were asked
to choose from are given in Table 4, with the fre-
quency of each choice. The original sentence that
had 6 alternatives is given in (3). The six alterna-
tives generated by the grammar and the frequen-
cies with which they were chosen is given in Table
5.

for (2) and their frequencies
Tables 4 and 5 tell different stories. On the one
hand, although each of the 4 alternatives was cho-
sen at least once from Table 4, there is a clear pref-
erence for one string (and this is also the origi-
nal string from the TIGER Corpus). On the other
hand, there is no clear preference9 for any one of
the alternatives in Table 5, and, in fact, the alterna-
tive that was selected most frequently by the par-
ticipants is not the original string. Interestingly,
out of the 41 items presented to participants, the
original string was chosen by the majority of par-
ticipants in 36 cases. Again, this confirms the
hypothesis that there is a certain amount of ac-
ceptable variation for native speakers but there are
clear preferences for certain strings over others.

4.3 Effects of context
As explained in Section 3.1, Part 3 of our exper-
iment was identical to Part 1, except that the par-
ticipants could see some preceding context. The
aim of this part was to investigate to what extent
discourse factors influence the way in which hu-
man judges evaluate the output of the realisation
ranker. In Task 3a, we expected the original strings
to be ranked (even) higher in context than out of
context; consequently, the ranks of the realisations
selected by the log-linear and the language model
would have to go down. With respect to Task 3b,
we had no particular expectation, but were just in-
terested in seeing whether some preceding context
would affect the evaluation results for the strings
selected as most probable by the log-linear model
ranker in any way.
Table 6 summarises the results of Task 3a. It
shows that, at least overall, our expectation that the
original corpus sentences would be ranked higher
within context than out of context was not borne
out. Actually, they were ranked a bit lower than
they were when presented in isolation, and the
only realisations that are ranked slightly higher
overall are the ones selected by the trigram LM.
The overall results of Task 3b are presented in
Figure 7. Interestingly, although we did not ex-
pect any particular effect of preceding context on
the way the participants would rate the realisa-
tions selected by the log-linear model, the natu-
ralness scores were higher in the condition with
context (Task 3b) than in the one without context

Table 6: Task 3a: Ranks for each system (com-
pared to ranks in Task 1a)
(Task 1b). One explanation might be that sen-
tences in some sort of default order are generally
rated higher in context than out of context, simply
because the context makes sentences less surpris-
ing.
Since, contrary to our expectations, we could
not detect a clear effect of context in the overall re-
sults of Task 3a, we investigated how the average
ranks of the three alternatives presented for indi-
vidual items differ between Task 1a and Task 3a.
An example of an original corpus sentence which
many participants ranked higher in context than in
isolation is given in (4a.). The realisations selected
by the the log-linear model and the trigram LM are
given in (4b.) and (4c.) respectively, and the con-
text shown to the participants is given above these
alternatives. We believe that the context has this
effect because it prepares the reader for the struc-
ture with the sentence-initial predicative partici-
ple entscheidend; usually, these elements appear
rather in clause-final position.
In contrast, (5a) is an example of a corpus

Figure 7: Tasks 1b and 3b: Naturalness scores
for strings chosen by log-linear model, presented
without and with context
sentence which our participants tended to rank
lower in context than in isolation. Actually, the
human judges preferred the realisation selected
by the trigram LM to the original sentence and
the realisation chosen by the log-linear model in
both conditions, but this preference was even re-
inforced when context was available. One expla-
nation might be that the two preceding sentences
are precisely about the decision to which the ini-
tial phrase of variant (5b) refers, which ensures a
smooth flow of the discourse.
4.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement
We measure two types of annotator agreement.
First we measure how well each annotator agrees
with him/herself. This is done by evaluating what
percentage of the time an annotator made the same
choice when presented with the same item choices
(recall that as described in Section 3, a number of
items were presented randomly more than once to
each participant). The results are given in Table 7.
The results show that in between 70% and 74% of
cases, judges make the same decision when pre-
sented with the same data. We found this to be a
surprisingly low number and think that it is most
likely due to the acceptable variation in word or-
der for speakers. Another measure of agreement
is how well the individual participants agree with
each other. In order to establish this, we cal-
culate an average Spearmanís correlation coeffi-
cient (non-parametric Pearsonís correlation coef-
ficient) between each participant for each experi-
ment. The results are summarised in Table 8. Al-
though these figures indicate a high level of inter-
annotator agreement, more tests are required to es-
tablish exactly what these figures mean for each
experiment.

his thesis several models of realisation ranking are
presented and evaluated against the original cor-
pus text. Chapter 8 describes a small human-based
experiment, where 7 native English speakers rank
the output of 4 systems. One system is the orig-
inal text, another is a randomly chosen baseline,
another is a string chosen by a log-linear model
and the fourth is one chosen by a language model.
Joint rankings were allowed. The results presented
in Velldal (2008) mirror our findings in Exper-
iments 1a and 3a, that native speakers rank the
original strings higher than the log-linear model
strings which are ranked higher than the language
model strings. In both cases, the log-linear mod-
els include the language model score as a feature
in the log-linear model. Nakanishi et al. (2005) re-
port that they achieve the best BLEU scores when
they do not include the language model score in
their log-linear model, but they also admit that
their language model was not trained on enough
data.
Belz and Reiter (2006) carry out a comparison
of automatic evaluation metrics against human do-
main experts and human non-experts in the do-
main of weather forecast statements. In their eval-
uations, the NIST score correlated more closely
than BLEU or ROUGE to the human judgements.
They conclude that more than 4 reference texts are
needed for automatic evaluation of NLG systems.
6 Conclusion and Outlook to Future
Work
In this paper, we have presented a human-based
experiment to evaluate the output of a realisation
ranking system for German. We evaluated the
original corpus text, and strings chosen by a lan-
guage model and a log-linear model. We found
that, at a global level, the human judgements mir-
rored the relative rankings of the three system ac-
cording to the BLEU score. In terms of natural-
ness, the strings chosen by the log-linear model
were generally given 4 or 5, indicating that al-
though the log-linear model might not choose the
same string as the original author had written, the
strings it was choosing were mostly very natural
strings.
When presented with all alternatives generated
by the grammar for a given input f-structure, the
human judges chose the same string as the origi-
nal author 70% of the time. In 5 out of 41 cases,
the majority of judges chose a string other than
the original string. These figures show that native
speakers accept some variation in word order, and
so caution should be exercised when using corpus-
derived reference data. The observed acceptable
variation was often linked to information struc-
tural considerations, and further experiments will
be carried out to investigate this relationship be-
tween word order and information structure.
In examining the effect of preceding context, we
found that overall context had very little effect. At
the level of individual sentences, however, clear
tendencies were observed, but there were some
sentences which were judged better in context and
others which were ranked lower. This again indi-
cates that corpus-derived reference data should be
used with caution.
An obvious next step is to examine how well
automatic metrics correlate with the human judge-
ments collected, not only at an individual sen-
tence level, but also at a global level. This can be
done using statistical techniques to correlate the
human judgements with the scores from the auto-
matic metrics. We will also examine the sentences
that were consistently judged to be of poor quality,
so that we can provide feedback to the developers
of the log-linear model in terms of possible addi-
tional features for disambiguation.
