Abst ract  
This i)al)er describes a Ilatural language i)ars -
ing algorith,n for unrestricted text which uses a 
prol)al)ility-I~ased scoring function to select the 
"l)est" i)arse of a sclfl,ence. The parser, T~earl, 
is a time-asynchronous I)ottom-ul) chart parser 
with Earley-tyl)e tol)-down prediction which l)ur - 
sues the highest-scoring theory iu the chart, where 
the score of a theory represents im extent o  which 
the context of the sentence predicts that interpre- 
tation. This parser dilrers front previous attemi)ts 
at stochastic parsers in that it uses a richer form of 
conditional prol)alfilities I)ased on context o l)re- 
diet likelihood. T>carl also provides a framework 
for i,lcorporating the results of previous work in 
i)art-of-spe(;ch assignrlmn|., unknown word too<l- 
ois, and other probal)ilistic models of lingvistic 
features into one parsing tool, interleaving these

All natural language grammars are alnbiguous. Even 
tightly fitting natural anguage grammars are ambigu- 
ous in some ways. Loosely fitting grammars, which are 
necessary for handling the variability and complexity 
of unrestricted text and speech, are worse. Tim stan-

gra.nunars I)y hand, is painful, time-consuming, and 
usually arbitrary. The solution which many people 
have proposed is to use stochastic models to grain sta- 
tistical grammars automatically from a large corpus. 
Attempts in applying statistical techniques to nat- 
ura, I iangt, age parsi,lg have exhibited varying degrees 
of success. These successful and unsuccessful attempts 
have suggested to us that: 
. Stochastic techniques combined with traditional lin- 
guistic theories can  (and indeed must) provide a so- 
lull|on to the natural language understanding prob- 
lem. 
* In order for stochastic techniques to be effective, 
they must be applied with restraint (poor estimates 
of context arc worse than none\[7\]). 
- Interactive, interleaved architectvres are preferable 
to pipeline architectures in NLU systems, because 
they use more of the available information in the 
decision-nmkiug process. 
Wc have constructed a stoch~tic parser,/)earl,  which 
is based on these ideas. 
The development of the 7~earl parser is an effort to 
combine the statistical models developed recently into 
a single tool which incorporates all of these models into 
the decisiou-making component of a parser, While we 
have only attempted to incorporate a few simple sta- 
tistical models into this parser, ~earl is structured in 
a way which allows any nt, mber of syntactic, semantic, 
and ~other knowledge sources to contribute to parsing 
decisions. The current implementation of "Pearl uses 
ChurclFs part-of-speech assignment trigram model, a 
simple probabilistic unknown word model, and a con-  
d i t iona l  probability model for grammar ules based on 
part-of-speech trigrams and parent rules. 
By combining multiple knowledge sources and using 
a chart-parsing framework, 7~earl attempts to handle 
a number of difficult problems. 7%arl has the capa- 
bility to parse word lattices, an ability which is useful 
in recognizing idioms in text processing, as well as in 
speech processing. The parser uses probabilistic train- 
ing from a corpus to disambiguate between grammati- 
cally ac(-i:ptal)h', structures, such ;m determining i)repo - 
-15 -  
sitional l)hrase attachment and conjunction scope. Fi- 
nally, ?earl maintains a well-formed substring I,able 
within its chart to allow for partial parse retrieval. Par-

which have contributed to timt theory. This is e(lt, iva- 
lent to using the sum of the logs of l.hese probal)ilities.

In a very large parsed corpus of English text, one 
finds I, Imt, I,be most freq.ently occurring noun phrase 
structure in I, Iw text is a nomt plu'asc containing a 
determiner followed by a noun. Simple probabilistic 
CFGs dictate that, given this information, "determiner 
noun" should be the most likely interpretation of a 
IlOUn phrase. 
Now, consider only those noun phrases which oc- 
cur as subjects of a senl,ence. In a given corpus, you 
nlighl, liml that pronouns occur just as fre(luently as 
"lletermincr nou,,"s in the subject I)ositiou. This type 
of information can easily be cai)tnred by conditional 
l)robalfilities. 
Finally, tmsume that the sentence begins with a pro- 
noun followed by a verb. In l.his case, it is quite clear 
that, while you can probably concoct a sentence which 
fit, s this description and does not have a pronoun for 
a subject, I,he first, theory which you should pursue is 
one which makes this hypothesis. 
The context-sensitive conditional probabilities which 
?earl  uses take into account he irnmediate parent of 
a theory 3 and the part-of-speech trigram centered at 
the beginning of the theory. 
For example, consider the sentence: 
My first love was named ?earl .  
(no subliminal propaganda intended) 
A theory which tries to interpret "love" as a verb will 
be scored based ou the imrl,-of-speecll trigranl "adjec- 
tive verb verb" and the parent theory, probably "S --+ 
NP VP." A theory which interprets "love" as a noun 
will be scored based on the trigram "adjective noun 
w~rl)." AIl,llo.gll Io.xical prollabilities favor "love" as 
a verb, I, he comlitional i)robabilities will heavily favor 
"love" as a noun in tiffs context. 4

According to probability theory, the likelihood of two 
independent events occurring at the same time is the 
product of their individual probabilities. Previous sta- 
tistical parsing techniques apply this definition to the 
cooceurrence of two theories in a parse, and claim that 
the likelihood of the two theories being correct is the 
product of the probabilities of the two theories. 
3The parent of a theory is defined as a theory with a 
CF rule which co.tains the left-hand side of tile theory. 
For instance, if "S ---, NP VP" and "NP --+ det n" are two 
grammar rules, the first rule can be a parent of tile second, 
since tl,e left-hand side of tile second "NP" occurs in the 
right-hand side of the first rule. 
4In fact, tile part-of-speech tagging model which is Mso 
used in ~earl will heavily favor "love" as a noun. We ignore 
this behavior to demonstrate the benefits of the trigram 
co.ditioni.g.

of its length. When a rule is first predicted (Earley- 
styh;), its score is just its raw score, which relireseuts 
how uiuch {,lie context predicts it. llowever, when the 
parse process hypothesizes interpretations of tile sen- 
teuce which reinforce this theory, the geornetric nlean 
of all of the raw scorn of the rule's subtree is used, 
rcllrescnting the ow,rall likelihood or I.he i.heory given

reluctantly attributed to Chl,rcl,\[7\]. This technique 
estiniatcs the probability of au event by adding 0.5 to 
every frequency count. ~ Low-scoring theories will be 
predicted by the Earley-style parscr. And, if no other 
hypothesis i suggested, these theories will be pt, rsued. 
If a high scoring theory advauces a theory with a very 
low raw score, the resulting theory's core will be the 
geonletric nlean of all of the raw scores of theories con- 
tained in that thcory, and thus will I)e nluch higher 
than the low-scoring theory's core.

how the conditional-probability-b<~sed scoring flinction 
handles anlbiguity, consider the sentence 
Fruit, flies like a banana.

should indicate that the word "flies" is niore likely to 
be a plural noun than an active verb. This information 
is incorporated in the trigram scores, llowever, when 
the interliretation 
S --+ . NP VP 
is proposed, two possible NPs will be parsed, 
NP ~ nolnl (fruit) 
all d 
NP -+ noun nouu (fruit flies). 
Sitlce this sentence is syntactically ambiguous, if the 
first hypothesis i tested first, the parser will interpret 
this sentence incorrectly. 
ll0wever, this will not happen in this donlain. Since 
"fruit flies" is a common idiom in insect studies, the 
score of its trigram, noun noun verb, will be much 
greater than the score of the trigram, noun verb verb. 
Titus, not only will the lexical probability of the word 
"flies/verb" be lower than that of "flies/noun," but also 
tile raw score of "NP  --+ noun (fruit)" will be lower than

T'- ear l ' s  Capab i l i t ies  
Besides nsing statistical methods to guide tile parser 
l,hrough I,h,' I)arsing search space, Pearl also performs 
other functions which arc crucial to robustly processing 
UlU'estricted uatural language text aud speech. 
Hand l ing  Unknown Words  Pearl uses a very sim- 
ple I)robal)ilistic unknown word model to hypol.h(nsize 
categories for unknown words. When word which is 
unknown to the systenl's lexicon, tile word is assumed 
to I)e a.ny one of the open class categories. The lexical 
i)rol);d)ility givell a (-atcgory is the I)rol)ability of that 
category occurring in the training corpus. 
Id iom Process ing  and Lat, t ice Pars ing  Since the 
parsing search space can be simplified by recognizing 
idioms, Pearl allows tile input string to i,iclude idioms 
that span more than one word in tile sentence. This is 
accoml)lished by viewing the input sentence as a word 
la.ttice instead of a word string. Since idion}s tend to be 
uuand)igttous with respect to part-of-speech, they are 
generally favored over processing the individual words 
that make up the idiom, since the scores of rules con- 
taining the words will ten(I to be less thau 1, while 
a syntactically apl)rol)riate, unambiguous idiom will 
have a score of close to 1. 
The ahility to parse a scnl.epce wil, h multiple word 
hyl)otlmses and word I)oulidary hyl)othcses makes 
PeaH very usehd in the domain of spoken language 
processing. By delayiug decisions about word selection 
I)ut maintaining scoring information from a sl)eech rec- 
ognizer, tlic I>a.rser can use granmlaticai information in 
word selection without slowing the speech recognition 
pro(~ess. Because of Pearl 's interleaved architecture, 
one could easily incorporate scoring information from 
a speech rccogniz, cr into the set of scoring functions 
used in tile parser. Pearl could also provide feedback 
to the specch recognizer about the grammaticality of
fragnmitt hypotheses to guide the recognizer's search. 
Par t ia l  Parses  The main advantage of chart-based 
parsiug over other parsing algorithms is that the parser 
can also recognize well-formed substrings within the 
sentence in the course of pursuing a complete parse. 
Pearl takes fidl advantage of this characteristic. Once 
Pearl is given the input sentence, it awaits instructions 
a.s to what type of parse should be attempted for this 
i,lput. A standard parser automatically attempts to 
produce asentence (S) spanning tile entire input string. 
llowever, if this fails, the semantic interpreter might be 
able to (Icriw-' some mealfiug from the sentence if given 
18-  
aon-ow'.rhq~pirig noun, w~.rb, and prepositional phrases. 
If a s,,nte,,ce f~tils I,o parse,, requests h)r p;trLial parses 
of the input string call be made by specifying a range 
which the parse l.ree should cover and the category 
(NP, VI', etc.).

While this accuracy is expected for unknown words 
in isolation, based oil the accuracy of the part-of- 
speech tagging model, the performance is expected to 
degrade for sequences of unk,lown words. 
P repos i t iona l  Phrase  At tachment  
Acc0rately determining prepositional phrase attach- 
nlent in general is a difficult and well-documented 
problem, llowever, based on experience with several 
different donmins, we have found prel)ositional phrase 
attachment to be a domain-specific pheuomenon for 
which training ca,t I)e very helpfld. For insta,tce, in 
the dirccl.ion-li,ldi,,g do,lmin, from aml to prepositional 
phrases generally attach to the preceding verb and 
not to any noun phrase. This tende,icy is captured 
iu the training process for .pearl and is used to guide 
the parscr to the more likely attach,nent with respect 
to ~he domain. This does not mean that Pearl will 
gel. the correct parse when the less likely attachme\]tt 
is correct; in fact, .pearl will invariably get this case 
wrong, llowever, based on the premise that this is the 
less likely attachment, his will produce more correct 
analyses than incorrect. And, using a more sophisti- 
cated statistical model, this pcrfornla,lcc an easily be 
improved. 
"Pearl's performance on prepositional phrase attach- 
meat was very high (54/55 or 98.2% correct). The rea- 
so,i the accuracy rate was so high is that/.lie direction- 
finding domain is very consistent in it's use of individ- 
t,al prepositions. The accuracy rate is not expected 
to be as high in other domains, although it certainly

should be higher than 50% and we would expect it to 
bc greater than 75 %, although wc have nol. performed 
any rigorous tests on other (Ionmius to verify this.

Future  Work  
The "Pearl parser takes advantage ofdonmin-depen(lent 
information to select the most approi)riate interpreta- 
tion of an inpul,. Ilowew'.r, i,he statistical measure used 
to disalnbiguate these interpretations is sensitive to 
certain attributes of the grammatical formalism used, 
as well as to the part-of-si)eech categories used to la- 
I)el lexical entries. All of the exl)erimcnts performed on 
T'carl titus fa," have been using one gra.l inrla.r, one  pa.rl.- 
of-speech tag set, and one donlaiu (hecause of avail- 
ability constra.ints). Future experime.nl,s are I)lanned 
to evalua.l,e "Pearl's i)erforma.nce on dii\[cre.nt domaius, 
as well as on a general corpus of English, arid ott dig 
fi~rent grammars, including a granunar derived fi'om a 
nlanually parsed corl)us. 
Conc lus ion  
The probal)ilistic parser which we have described pro- 
vides a I)latform for exploiting the useful informa- 
tion made available by statistical models in a manner 
which is consistent with existing grammar formalisms 
and parser desigus. 7)carl can bc trained to use any 
context-free granurlar, ;iccompanied I)y tile al)l)ropri- 
ate training matc,'ial. Anti, the parsing algorithm is 
very similar to a standard bottom-t,I) algorithm, with 
the exception of using theory scores to order the search. 
More thorough testing is necessary to inclosure

lection, preliminary tesl.s how /)earl performs these 
ttLsks with a high degree of accuracy.
