1. Introduction 
One can't help but be fascinated by two sentences in parallel translation, the selfsame 
meaning diffused, distributed, diverging across alternative xpressions. In his Le Ton 
beau de Marot: In Praise of the Music of Language, Douglas Hofstadter goes to the extreme 
of inventing or examining dozens upon dozens of alternative English translations of 
a single 18-line French poem, reveling in the nuances of content and form. Articles 
on machine translation technology in the popular press place the obligatory man- 
gled proverb, obtained by automatic translation and then automatic back-translation, 
against its original. Closer to home, students of syntactic theory examine word-by- 
word glosses of sentences in unfamiliar languages in order to see uncovered there 
the building blocks--morpheme, inflectional marking--that recombine into a fluid 
expression using familiar words. 
By all rights, Parallel Text Processing should be merely a technical volume, and this 
should be merely a technical review. But editor V4ronis has chosen to leave until the 
end the technical inspiration for the book, namely, the ARCADE evaluation exercise 
for sentence- and word-level alignment systems. At the start of the book, instead, he 
places a tiny gem of a preface written by Martin Kay. In this preface, Kay makes 
two significant observations about corpora. First, he notes that what makes current 
statistical methods tick is that they use knowledge about language as a proxy for 
world knowledge; second, he argues that aligned texts are a rich source of knowledge 
about language, knowledge placed there by human translators. 
To be sure, Kay expresses doubt about the adequacy of corpora to serve in place 
of world knowledge where the tough problems are concerned: "More substantial suc- 
cesses in these enterprises \[such as high-quality automatic translation\] will require a 
sharper image of the world than any that can be made out simply from the statistics 
of language use" (page xvii). I myself am more optimistic, because as our field moves 
from its statistical renaissance into the next phase, I think we are seeing a return to 
semantic issues that may help provide the "sharper image of the world" Kay believes 
necessary. I do not mean by this a renewed focus on semantic theory per se, but rather 
a return to questions of meaning and world knowledge accompanied by the insights of 
quantitative, corpus-based approaches. To take a few examples, stochastic parsing has 
moved beyond constituency analyses to syntactic dependencies, which are closer to

underlying thematic relationships (Haji~ et al. 1998); large-scale xical resources are be- 
ing built with more elaborated semantic underpinnings (Fillmore, Wooters, and Baker 
2001; Vossen 1998), and the productive annotate-train-evaluate paradigm is finding 
application in meaning-oriented tasks ranging from named entity identification and 
coreference (Harman and Chinchor 2001) to word sense disambiguation (Cotton et al. 
2001). 
2. Individual Contr ibutions 
Whether or not one shares my optimism for the long-term future of semantic depth 
in corpus-based approaches, it is clear that, as Kay puts it, "The unparalleled richness 
of aligned texts for a great number of purposes is clear for anyone to see" (page xvii). 
V4ronis begins the collection with "From the Rosetta stone to the information society: 
A survey of parallel text processing," a very nice survey of how parallel texts are 
processed and used, laying out clearly the book's organization into major sections 
on techniques for alignment, applications of parallel texts, and corpus resources and 
evaluation. Starting in this first chapter by V4ronis, points of consensus quickly emerge 
in alignment methodology, notably principles of lexical anchoring (e.g., dictionary- 
based word pairs or cognate pairs) and of length correlation (taking advantage of 
the tendency of short units to translate into short, medium into medium, long into 
long), with these two principles erving individually or in combination as the basis 
for establishing correspondences. 
The first five methodology chapters lay out alternative approaches taking advan- 
tage of multiple sources of information within various levels of analysis. Melamed's 
chapter, "Pattern recognition for mapping bitext correspondence," lays out a powerful 
and general geometric approach to identifying token-level correspondences that takes 
advantage of both the general ength correlation and a general matching predicate 
that can exploit dictionary- or cognate-based lexical anchors as available. Simard, in 
"Multilingual text alignment: Aligning three or more versions of a text," focuses on 
sentence-level alignment, adapting techniques from molecular biology. A key innova- 
tion here is the exploration of how transitivity of word-level translations in multilingual 
parallel texts can help identify correspondences missed in the component bilingual 
corpora. Ahrenberg, Andersson, and Merkel, in "A knowledge-lite approach to word 
alignment," emphasize a modular combination of resources, with the ultimate aim of 
obtaining a nonprobabilistic translation lexicon from parallel corpus links; the chapter 
demonstrates portability from English-Swedish to English-French language pairs. The 
chapter by Choueka, Conley, and Dagan, "A comprehensive bilingual word alignment 
system--application t  disparate languages: Hebrew and English," is distinguished by 
its focus on relevant properties of the languages, notably issues of morphology and 
lemmatization i  a Semitic language. The chapter is likely to be of interest to the grow- 
ing segment of the community looking at the English-Arabic language pair. Piperidis, 
Papageorgiou, and Boutsis, in "From sentences towords and clauses," look at multiple 
levels of alignment--words, noun phrases, clauses, and sentences--with a focus on 
machine-assisted translatit~n of English-Greek. 
The remaining four alignment methodology chapters explore radically different 
visions of what it means for two texts to be aligned. Wu, in "Bracketing and aligning 
words and constituents in parallel text using Stochastic Inversion Transduction Gram- 
mars," presents a stochastic grammar formalism that characterizes sentence pairs, and 
associated algorithms, making it possible to take a generative or language-modeling 
view of parallel texts. The chapter offers a clear exposition covering bracketing, phrasal 
alignment, and word alignment. Fluhr, Bisson, and Elkateb, in "Parallel text alignment 
593 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
using crosslingual information retrieval techniques," view the sentence alignment pro- 
cess as one in which the goal is to match sentences with their translations, much as 
queries are matched with relevant documents in many retrieval systems based on a 
vector space notion of semantic proximity. The resulting technique is naturally quite 
robust in the face of gaps or order variations. In "Parallel alignment of structured oc- 
uments," Romary and Bonhomme view documents as multilevel structures and take 
advantage of structure information in alignment. The chapter includes an interesting 
description of relevant aspects of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines for anno- 
tating document structure. Although the chapter by Santos, "The translation etwork: 
A model for a fine-grained escription of translations," accompanies in this section 
other chapters concerning alignment methods, the main emphasis of the chapter is a 
detailed corpus study rather than alignment techniques. The empirical evidence leads 
Santos to challenge standard assumptions about parallel texts and alignment and to 
propose an alternative conception of translation inspired by the monolingual notion 
of aspectual coercion. 
The five chapters on applications of parallel text and alignment illustrate signifi- 
cant diversity, and at the same time they all draw attention to fundamental problems 
concerning the matching of units of meaning at the right granularity. Fung, in "A 
statistical view on bilingual exicon extraction: From parallel corpora to non-parallel 
corpora," raises the question of how to deal with bilingual corpora containing noise, 
as might be the case when sentence-level units are not cleanly aligned. In order to 
handle corpora containing comparable documents rather than parallel translations, 
Fung suggests a vector space approach similar to that of Fluhr, Bisson, and Elkateb 
but at the level of word contexts rather than sentences. Blank's chapter, "Terminol- 
ogy extraction from parallel technical texts," differs from some of the preceding work 
in its focus on a particular domain (patent documentation) and technical terminol- 
ogy. Monolingual terminology identification is combined with semiautomatic tools 
for matching terms; French and German illustrate problems encountered when try- 
ing to match multiword versus compounded terms. Gaussier, Hull, and Ait-Mokhtar, 
in "Term alignment in use: Machine-aided human translation," present methods for 
term extraction and alignment as well as innovative translation memory techniques 
that permit multilevel matching. Brown, CarboneU, and Yang, in "Automatic dictio- 
nary extraction for cross-language information retrieval," extract abilingual dictionary 
using a simple technique based on co-occurrence frequency, use the resulting entries 
to improve alignments, then extract an improved ictionary; they present comparative 
results in cross-language r trieval experiments. Nerbonne's chapter, "Parallel texts in 
computer-assisted language learning," provides background on language learning and 
presents a tool to assist Dutch students of French. The tool approximates automatic 
glossing of French sentences in Dutch and permits ready access to parallel examples, 
relying heavily on the ability to treat morphological variants as equivalents. 
The final section of the book concerns efforts to support he community by means 
of parallel corpora, resource sharing, and common evaluation. Isahara and Haruno's 
chapter, "Japanese-English aligned bilingual corpora," is really a combination of a 
proposed alignment technique and a corpus-building project. The chapter makes clear 
how difficult it can be, owing to availability, quality, and copyright issues, to produce 
a parallel corpus of reasonable size, even for better-studied languages such as English 
and Japanese. Singh, McEnery, and Baker's chapter, "Building a parallel corpus of 
English/Panjabi," strongly reinforces the message of the previous chapter. For modern 
Panjabi, a representative of Indic languages, the authors after a great deal of work 
found a collection of children's bedtime stories with English translations, tracked own 
the author for permission, and ultimately typed the Panjabi text in by hand because 
594

it was unavailable as electronic text. In the chapter by Melby, "Sharing of translation 
memory databases derived from aligned parallel text," the author describes in detail 
the translation memory exchange (TMX) format, developed by a standards group in 
order to facilitate the sharing of translation memory databases. V4ronis and Langlais, 
in "Evaluation of parallel text alignment systems: The ARCADE project," describe 
the common evaluation of parallel text alignment systems. They report greater than 
98% sentence alignment accuracy for systems on "normal" texts; word alignment was 
evaluated nonexhaustively and yielded accuracy estimates in the vicinity of 75%. 
3. Conclusion 
Parallel Text Processing succeeds admirably at its goals and will be of use to a wide range 
of people. One of the book's primary goals is to address a wide range of topics and to 
cut across communities, and it does a surprisingly good job of balancing introductory 
and historical material with technical substance. The overall coherent organization is
supported further by the abstracts and keywords at the front of each chapter. I can 
easily imagine using this book both to introduce ideas in a graduate seminar and as 
a reference for research. 
The book should be quite accessible to graduate students and researchers in com- 
putational linguistics and to computer scientists. Linguists, translators, or those with 
less mathematical background might want to brush up on their understanding of basic 
probability theory and to perhaps get a brief tutorial on dynamic programming from 
a friendly computer scientist. Even skimming the more technical sections, however, 
they are likely to be rewarded by interesting material. All readers will be grateful that 
the editor chose to include separate and fairly thorough indexes for terms, authors, 
and languages and writing systems.
