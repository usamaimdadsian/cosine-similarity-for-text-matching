Abstract
Automatic metrics are widely used in ma-
chine translation as a substitute for hu-
man assessment. With the introduction
of any new metric comes the question of
just how well that metric mimics human
assessment of translation quality. This is
often measured by correlation with hu-
man judgment. Significance tests are gen-
erally not used to establish whether im-
provements over existing methods such as
BLEU are statistically significant or have
occurred simply by chance, however. In
this paper, we introduce a significance test
for comparing correlations of two metrics,
along with an open-source implementation
of the test. When applied to a range of
metrics across seven language pairs, tests
show that for a high proportion of metrics,
there is insufficient evidence to conclude
significant improvement over BLEU.
1 Introduction
Within machine translation (MT), efforts are on-
going to improve evaluation metrics and find bet-
ter ways to automatically assess translation qual-
ity. The process of validating a new metric in-
volves demonstration that it correlates better with
human judgment than a standard metric such as
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001). However, although
it is standard practice in MT evaluation to mea-
sure increases in automatic metric scores with sig-
nificance tests (Germann, 2003; Och, 2003; Ku-
mar and Byrne, 2004; Koehn, 2004; Riezler and
Maxwell, 2005; Graham et al., 2014), this has
not been the case in papers proposing new met-
rics. Thus it is possible that some reported im-
provements in correlation with human judgment
are attributable to chance rather than a systematic
improvement.
In this paper, we motivate and introduce a novel
significance test to assess the statistical signifi-
cance of differences in correlation with human
judgment for pairs of automatic metrics. We ap-
ply tests to the WMT-12 shared metrics task to
compare each of the participating methods, and
find that for a high proportion of metrics, there is
not enough evidence to conclude that they signifi-
cantly outperform BLEU.
2 Correlation with Human Judgment
A common means of assessing automatic MT
evaluation metrics is Spearman’s rank correlation
with human judgments (Melamed et al., 2003),
which measures the relative degree of monotonic-
ity between the metric and human scores in the
range [?1, 1]. The standard justification for cal-
culating correlations over ranks rather than raw
scores is to: (a) reduce anomalies due to absolute
score differences; and (b) focus evaluation on what
is generally the primary area of interest, namely
the ranking of systems/translations.
An alternative means of evaluation is Pearson’s
correlation, which measures the linear correlation
between a metric and human scores (Leusch et al.,
2003). Debate on the relative merits of Spear-
man’s and Pearson’s correlation for the evaluation
of automatic metrics is ongoing, but there is an in-
creasing trend towards Pearson’s correlation, e.g.
in the recent WMT-14 shared metrics task.
Figure 1 presents the system-level results for
two evaluation metrics – AMBER (Chen et al.,
2012) and TERRORCAT (Fishel et al., 2012)
– over the WMT-12 Spanish-to-English metrics
task. These two metrics achieved the joint-highest
rank correlation (? = 0.965) for the task, but dif-
fer greatly in terms of Pearson’s correlation (r =
0.881 vs. 0.971, resp.). The largest contributor to
this artifact is the system with the lowest human
score, represented by the leftmost point in both
plots.

MT evaluation metrics (AMBER and TERRORCAT)
Consistent with the WMT-14 metrics shared
task, we argue that Pearson’s correlation is more
sensitive than Spearman’s correlation. There is
still the question, however, of whether an observed
difference in Pearson’s r is statistically significant,
which we address in the next section.
3 Significance Testing
Evaluation of a new automatic metric, M
new
,
commonly takes the form of quantifying the cor-
relation between the new metric and human judg-
ment, r(M
new
, H), and contrasting it with the cor-
relation for some baseline metric, r(M
base
, H). It
is very rare in the MT literature for significance
testing to be performed in such cases, however.
We introduce a statistical test which can be used
for this purpose, and apply the test to the evalua-
tion of metrics participating in the WMT-12 metric
evaluation task.
At first gloss, it might seem reasonable to per-
form significance testing in the following man-
ner when an increase in correlation with human
assessment is observed: apply a significance test
separately to the correlation of each metric with
human judgment, with the hope that the newly
proposed metric will achieve a significant correla-
tion where the baseline metric does not. However,
besides the fact that the correlation between al-
most any document-level metric and human judg-
ment will generally be significantly greater than
zero, the logic here is flawed: the fact that
one correlation is significantly higher than zero
(r(M
new
, H)) and that of another is not, does not
necessarily mean that the difference between the
two correlations is significant. Instead, a specific
test should be applied to the difference in corre-
lations on the data. For this same reason, con-
fidence intervals for individual correlations with
human judgment are also not particularly mean-
ingful.
In psychological studies, it is often the case that
samples that data are drawn from are independent,
and differences in correlations are computed on in-
dependent data sets. In such cases, the Fisher r
to z transformation is applied to test for signifi-
cant differences in correlations. In the case of au-
tomatic metric evaluation, however, the data sets
used are almost never independent. This means
that if r(M
base
, H) and r(M
new
, H) are both> 0,
the correlation between the metric scores them-
selves, r(M
base
,M
new
), must also be > 0. The
strength of this correlation, directly between pairs
of metrics, should be taken into account using a
significance test of the difference in correlation be-
tween r(M
base
, H) and r(M
new
, H).
3.1 Correlated Correlations
Correlations computed for two separate automatic
metrics on the same data set are not independent,
and for this reason in order to test the difference in
correlation between them, the degree to which the
pair of metrics correlate with each other should be
taken into account. The Williams test (Williams,

4 Evaluation and Discussion
Figure 2a is a heatmap of the degree to which au-
tomatic metrics correlate with one another when
computed on the same data set, in the form of the
Pearson’s correlation between each pair of met-
rics that participated in the WMT-12 metrics task
for Spanish-to-English evaluation. Metrics are or-
dered in all tables from highest to lowest correla-
tion with human assessment. In addition, for the

Also sometimes referred to as the Hotelling–Williams
test.
purposes of significance testing, we take the abso-
lute value of all correlations, in order to compare
error-based metrics with non-error based ones.
In general, the correlation is high amongst all
pairs of metrics, with a high proportion of paired
metrics achieving a correlation in excess of r =
0.9. Two exceptions to this are TERRORCAT
(Fishel et al., 2012) and SAGAN (Castillo and Es-
trella, 2012), as seen in the regions of yellow and
white.
Figure 2b shows the results of Williams sig-
nificance tests for all pairs of metrics. Since we
are interested in not only identifying significant
differences in correlations, but ultimately ranking
competing metrics, we use a one-sided test. Here
again, the metrics are ordered from highest to low-
est (absolute) correlation with human judgment.
For the Spanish-to-English systems, approxi-
mately 60% of WMT-12 metric pairs show a sig-
nificant difference in correlation with human judg-
ment at p < 0.05 (for one of the two metric di-
rections).
2
As expected, the higher the correlation
with human judgment, the more metrics a given
method is superior to at a level of statistical signifi-
cance. Although TERRORCAT (Fishel et al., 2012)
achieves the highest absolute correlation with hu-
man judgment, it is not significantly better (p ?
0.05) than the four next-best metrics (METEOR
(Denkowski and Lavie, 2011), SAGAN (Castillo
and Estrella, 2012), SEMPOS (Mach´a?cek and Bo-

not enough evidence to conclude, therefore, that
this metric is any better at evaluating Spanish-to-
English MT system quality than the next four met-
rics.
Figure 3 shows the results of significance tests
for the six other language pairs used in the WMT-
12 metrics shared task.

For no language pair
is there an outright winner amongst the met-
rics, with proportions of significant differences be-
tween metrics for a given language pair ranging
from 3% for Czech-to-English to 82% for English-
to-French (p < 0.05). The number of metrics that
significantly outperform BLEU for a given lan-
guage pair is only 34% (p < 0.05), and no method
significantly outperforms BLEU over all language
pairs – indeed, even the best methods achieve sta-
tistical significance over BLEU for only a small
minority of language pairs. This underlines the
dangers of assessing metrics based solely on cor-
relation numbers, and emphasizes the importance
of statistical testing.
It is important to note that the number of com-

peting metrics a metric significantly outperforms
should not be used as the criterion for ranking
competing metrics. This is due to the fact that
the power of the Williams test to identify signifi-
cant differences between correlations changes de-
pending on the degree to which the pair of met-
rics correlate with each other. Therefore, a metric
that happens to correlate strongly with many other
metrics would be at an unfair advantage, were
numbers of significant wins to be used to rank met-
rics. For this reason, it is best to interpret pairwise
metric tests in isolation.
As part of this research, we have made avail-
able an open-source implementation of statis-
tical tests tailored to the assessment of MT
metrics available at https://github.com/

5 Conclusions
We have provided an analysis of current method-
ologies for evaluating automatic metrics in ma-
chine translation, and identified an issue with re-
spect to the lack of significance testing. We in-
troduced the Williams test as a means of cal-
culating the statistical significance of differences
175
in correlations for dependent samples. Analysis
of statistical significance in the WMT-12 metrics
shared task showed there is currently insufficient
evidence for a high proportion of metrics to con-
clude that they outperform BLEU.
