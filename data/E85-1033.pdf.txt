ABSTRACT 
The following paper concerns a general scheme 
for multilingual text generation, as opposed to 
just translation. Our system processes the text 
as a who le ,  from which  it ex t rac ts  a 
representation of the meaning of the text. From 
this representation, a new text is generated, 
using a text modei and action ruies. 
This process is done in six steps : word 
analysis, sentence analysis using a Functional 
Grammar, reference so iv ing  and inference, 
construction of the text pattern, sentence 
generation, and word generation. Different 
kinds of information are used st each step of 
the process : text organizat ion,  syntax, 
semantic, etc. 
All the knowledge, as well as the text, is 
given in a declarative manner. It is expressed 
in a s ingle formal ism named Funct iona l  
Oescriptions. It consists of lexical data, a 
Functional Grammar, a knowledge network, action 
rules for reference so lv ing  and sentence 
generat ion ,  mode ls  of text,  ru les  of 
structuration, and sentence schema. 
Text representation, included in the semantic 
network, is composed of different kinds of 
objects (not necessar i l y  distinct) : text 
organization, syntactical information, objects 
introduced by the discourse, affirmations on 
these objects, and l inks between these 
affirmations. 
I TEXT VERSUS SENTENCES 
the one hand rearrange a whole sentence in order 
to respect certain stylistic rules and on the 
other hand modify the order of these sentences. 
Some of them may be deleted and others added. 
In any ease, in order to be able to generate 
a coherent text by means of the information 
extracted from a source text, it seems most 
important to us to understand what the text is 
refering to. 
We have restricted our scope to economic 
geography texts, taken from a French review 
named ATLASECO. These texts deaI with industry 
and agriculture, invoiving reiated concepts 
(growth, deci ine,  product ion,  economica I  
balance...). Our system parses a french text, 
integrates its informative content into a 
knowledge base, then generates a new text from 
information extracted from this base. 
We present  in par t  (2) the text  
representation used throughout the process. We 
descr ibe  in part  (3) the knowledge 
representat ion ,  based on the funct iona l  
descr ipt ions.  In part (4), we briefly describe 
the different steps of the process. 
2 TEXT REPRESENTATION 
A text conveys information by various means. 
For example, the order of sentences, as well as 
their syntactic structure, may be significant. 
The general text representation we use is the 
same for understanding and structuring. This 
representation includes the different kinds of 
information needed for these two processes. 
Human translation is a complex process whose 
activities are not yet entirely understood. 
Generation of text differs from generation of 
s ingle sentences : our work stresses the 
necessary processing of the text as a whole and 
restructuring of this text. A translator must on 
The text is represented by a set of 
interrelated objects (sentences, words, semantic 
objects...). There are five classes of objects, 
not necessarily distinct : the visible objects, 
the syntactic components, the discursive objects 
(defined later), the affirmations and the links. 
226 
2.1 Visible Objects 
Visible objects are chapters, paragraphs, 
sentences, words and word sequences . They are 
reiated by positionai iinks, describing the 
organization of the text, as shown by the 
foIiowing figure : 
TEXT 
SENTENCE 1 . . " r='~"J 5ENTEN~En / S / 
OB3 1 083 2 083 n OB3 1 083 n 
fig. i 
These l inks ref lect  the h ierarch ica l  
organization of the text (chapters ...) and the 
dependent relationship of statements (order of 
sentences ...). 
2.2 Syntactic Components 
The sentences are represented by means of 
unordered  "syntact i c  cases"  ( sub jec t ,  
determiner...), linking a component with its 
subcomponents. For example : 
"the big mouse" ~ . ~  ~ ~  
body determiner quail fier 
J I i 
mouse definite big 
fig. Z 
2.3 D iscurs ive  Objects 
Discursive objects represent the semantic 
objects or  entities introduced by the text. For 
example : 
"The main crop is wheat, whose product ion  has 
s t rong ly  decreased .  Th is  dec l ine  has s t rong ly  
affected the commercial balance." 
These two constructions correspond to a 
single discursive object, which could be 
calied: "decrease of the production of wheat" 
The meaning of a sentence is represented by a 
network of discursive objects. The propositions, 
represenLing the d iscurs ive  objects, are 
normalized into an objscLive form. For example : 
'Peter met 3ohn" -> "meeting of 3ohn by Peter" 
"Mary is ill" -> "illness of Mary". 
This normalization is very usefui for co- 
reference soiving. 
The text itself may be a discursive object. 
Hence, it is represented by an object which 
mentions topic, date and positional links 
between sentences  of text. Our ing  the 
Understanding Process, this object will be 
enlarged by new information, or modified (for 
instance topic may become more explicit). 
2.4 Affirmations 
Implicit within the text, as well as simply 
introducing objects, is the eva luat ion  of 
certain objects. "The production is increasing" 
introduces "the production" and af f i rms "the 
increase of production". 
There are various statement values ("stated 
positively in discourse", "dubious"...). These 
values may be given by the author, a figure, an 
economical organization, etc. 
2.5 Links 
The links are mainly operators (and, or, 
because...) that correlate the affirmations, 
which are die cursive objects or links : "A 
because B" ; "A and B, but  C". 
They reflect internal structure of discourse. 
For example : "the production increases but the 
deficit remains important". 
During Understanding phase, Lheir main role 
is to transmit statement values to the objects 
they link. 
The structuring stage isolates argumentative 
effects of the discourse, and builds new links 
(possibly the same). The choice of these links 
is important because they have to be coherently 
acceptable from the reader point of view. 
3 KNOM_EDGE REPRESENTATION 
We use the same representat ion  for  a l l  types 
o f  knowledge  in  the  sys tem : lex ica l  
definitions, grammar rules, semantic rules,etc. 
They are given separately in the formalism of 
functional descriptions and integrated into the 
knowledge base that is represented by a 
functional descriptions network. 
227 
The language of functional descriptions comes 
from the functional grammars (DIK 78), which is 
a linguistic formalism that can be reiated to 
case grammars (FILLMORE 68). Historically, Kay 
(81) used functional descriptions as a genecel 
tool to represent grammars, independently of any 
speci f ic  l inguist ic  theory, after which 
Rousselot (84) then used functional descr ip t ions  
to represent any kind of knowledge (grammar, 
semantic rules, scripts..) in a system of story 
understanding. 
We will use "DF" instead of "functional 
description". 
A DF may represent any kind of knowledge. For 
example , "William cut himsel~' may be described 
by the following figure : 
\[action = cut 
tense = past 
actor = \[name = Wiiliam\] 
obj_act <I actor>\] 
fig. ) 
A OF is an unorde~ed set of identifier-object 
pairs. The identifiers are not pre-defined : 
they may be added or removed in any way. This 
allows us to put various kinds of information in 
the same description : syntactic, semantic, etc. 
The objects may be other DFB or paths .  
A path is a notation whose aim is to point 
to objects that ace already defined . We have 
two kinds of paths : 
- A local path <I list-of-identifier> points to 
an object in the current OF, as defined by the 
list of identifiers. For example, in fig. 3, 
the path <I actor name> cefers to "William". 
- A global path, <g starting-point list-of- 
ident i f iers> points to an object in the 
knowledge base. It is defined in the same way 
as the local path, except that the start ing 
point is the curcent DF. 
The internal representation of a DF is a 
labelled graph. For example, the representation 
of the DF in fig. ) is shown in fig. 4. 
as input and converts it directly into the 
labelled graph as shown in fig. 4, which is then 
integrated into the knowiedge base. 
A functional description network is the graph 
that represents a set of interlaced DFB, i.e. 
the knowledge base. This network is a labelled 
graph whose nodes correspond to OFs, and whose 
links to elementary object properties. These 
links are labelled with identifiers. 
colour 
table = ~ blue 
object (DF) property object (OF) 
f ig. 5 
Each identifier (e.g. colour) may be given 
di f ferent p ropect ies  (e.g. inhec i tance  
properties). This is done through attaching a 
node to the identifier. 
The graph may contain Dynamic Paths , which 
allow access to the objects. A dynamic path is a 
function <f starting-point list-of-identifiers> 
whose value is a node on the graph. Foc example, 
in fig. 4, the dynamic path <f (M) actor name> 
points to the node "William". Dynamic Paths ace 
very similar to substituable variables in formal 
systems. 
The processing of a DF network can be done at 
two levels : 
- e lementary  level : insert or delete links 
(i.e. propecties) or nodes (i.e. objects) ; 
- form leve l  : each node of the netwock can 
still be viewed as a description, which 
corresponds to a complex set of links. This 
a l lows  us to work on the form of the 
objects (pattern matching and merging). 
The main algorithms that operate at the form 
level are those of compat ib i l i ty  (pattern 
matching) and merging. "Compatilibity" is a 
boo lean funct ion that decides whether two 
descriptions may correspond to the same object 
of the real world. For example, could the events 
described by "William speaks to himselP' also be 
described by "Somebody speaks to Ted" 7 : 
7 cut William 
t e n s e ~  past 
Fig. 4 
The system takes the DF, as shown in fig. 3, 
~action = speak 
actor ~name = William\] 
ob j -ac t  = <I  ac tor>J  
\[action = speak 
actor = ~ is-a = huma~ 
obJ-act = \[ name Ted\]J 
fig. 6 
228 
These two descriptions are not compatible, 
because the name of ,he "obj-act" is "William" 
on one hand and "Ted" on the other. 
"William cut himself " 
action = cut 
tense = past 
actor  = \[name = 
ob j -ac t  <1 actor>\ ]  
William\] 
"X cut Y" 
\ [act ion = cut 
tense = past 
actor.  = \ [ i s -a  = human\] . 
obj-act Estate changed\]J 
\ [act ion = cut 
tense = past 
actor =\[  is-a = human 
name = William 
state = changed\] 
obj-act = <I actor>\] 
fig. 7 
Two compatible descriptions can be merged. 
The result is a new description, more complete 
than either of the originals. For example, the 
first two DFs of fig. 7 are compatible, and give 
the third one as the result of merging. 
These two algor i thms,  inspired by the 
functional unification introduced by Kay, are 
very powerfuI and are used at each step of text 
processing. Their precise definitions use 
mathematicaI transformations of iabeIIed graphs 
and are given in (GROSCOT, ROUSSELOT 85). 
/4 TEXT PROCESSING 
In this section, we describe the following 
different steps of the text processing : 
- word anaiysis 
- sentence anaIysis 
- reference solving 
- construction of the text pattern 
- sentence generation 
- word generation 
/4.1 Word Analysis 
The word analyser uses a knowledge base about 
the standard inflexions of the initial language 
and a dictionary of words and sequences of 
words. Each item in the dictionary contains a 
semantic definition, its syntactical category, 
and its type of infiexion with its roots. 
We generate for each word a description of 
its syntactic features. AII soiutions are 
generated. For exampie, the analysis of the word 
"burns" gives at least these two DFs : 
i )  \[word = burn 
number = p lura l  
category = substantive 
" ' "  \] 
2) \[word = burn  
category = verb 
tense = present 
person = 5 
number = singular 
o, ,  \] 
fig. 8 
/4.2 Sentence  Ana lys i s  - 
The analyser  is based on the work of 
Rousselot (8/4). It works sentence by sentence 
and assumes three important functions : 
- recognit ion and construction of syntactic 
components of a sentence 
-controI of semantic constraints 
- generation of the semantic representation of 
the sentence, i.e. an affirmation or a link 
The analyser uses a declarative grammar, 
which does not depend upon the way in which the 
anaiyser works. The grammar is a DF, in which 
each identifier-object pair represents a grammar 
ruIe. These rules aliow the analyser to sp i i ta  
syntactical category into constituents, to 
ver i fy  the constra ints ,  and to bui ld  the 
associated semantic representation. 
The analyser works in a top-down manner by 
means of an agenda which allows the separation 
of the controls. Also included in the anaIyser 
is a graph that contains the partiaI anaiysis 
which minimizes processing time during the 
backtracks. 
The starting point of this analyser is the 
set of DFs which have been obtained and graphed 
after word analysis. 
We show here, in an example, the result of 
the analysis of the sentence "Agriculture is a 
success" : 
object : success 
evaluated-object : \ [ob ject  = agr iculture 
def-undef = def in i te \ ]  
statement-value = true \]

4.3 Reference Solving 
This stage determines what the pronouns and 
noun phrases point to: known objects (already 
in the knowiedge base), or new objects 
introduced (directly or indirectly) by the text. 
The process uses action rules, written by 
means of OFs. The rules interpreter works in a 
"lazy" saturation mode : It local ly saturates 
the knowledge base regardless of whether or not 
all inferences have been made. 
The process has three main features : 
- i t  is d irected by the syntax (definite 
articles, pronouns..) 
- i t  identifies the objects at the semantic 
level, by testing the compatibility of 
discursive objects 
- i t  uses pos i t ional  l inks to def ine the 
possible references in each case. For example, 
a demonstrative pronoun has to be found among 
the preceding objects of the text 
It has two important effects : 
- it constructs a coherent network of discursive 
objects (the "meaning" of the text) 
- it integrates the text into the knowledge 
base : each time that the text refers to a 
known object, links are created from this 
object to the text 
When this is done, the posit ion of the 
information, may be inadequate for a coherent 
text. Therefore, the text structure is changed : 
some information is enhanced ; the paragraphs 
are balanced ; the information is reordered 
according to chrono log ica l  order and 
significance at the deepest level of the text 
structure. 
At this step, output text st ructure is 
clearly apparent. But it is not sufficient 
because the text has now become a sequence of 
unrelated statements. Links are then created 
between the discursive objects introduced in the 
text (conjunctions, pronouns...) and el l ipses 
are used to avoid repetitions. 
4.5 Sentence Generat ion  
From each OF of the text describing output 
information,  th is  s tage  generates  the 
description of a suitable sentence. 
Syntact ic  patterns are assoc iated with 
concepts  (evo lu t ions ,  apprec ia t ions ,  
numbers...). Action ruIes combine these patterns 
to create the description of a sentence, i.e. a 
iist of word descriptions. 
4.4  Const ruc t ion  o f  the text pattern 
Once the initial text has been analysed, its 
in format ive content is integrated in the 
knowledge base, thereby making it possible to 
question this base and to reformulate the so- 
obtained information with the aim of generating 
a new text .  
This stage bui lds the text structure 
(paragraphs, sub-paragraphs, sentences...) using 
two complementary approaches : the content of 
information and the evoIution of the v is ib le  
s t ructure  of the text. Indeed, text generation 
is a refIective process : generation of a singIe 
sentence of the text must take account the 
preceding and following text. All the processes 
used for structuring are written by means of 
rules. 
The starting point of structuring is a set of 
informat ion extracted from the knowledge 
network. 
First, all the information is inserted into a 
text model by means of their topics. Some 
obvious redundancies are eliminated : only one 
occurrence will be kept, in the most appropriate 
place. 
A.6 Word Generat ion  
Word generation uses the same organization of 
the knowledge base (about standard inflexions) 
as word anaiysis. 
From a list of word descriptions, inciuding 
syntactic features, the system constructs the 
output word. For example : 
word = burn 
cat = verb 
tense = present 
person = ) --> B U R N S 
number = singula d

.5 ANALYSING ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY TEXTS 
The texts we have analysed, taken from the 
French rev iew ATLASECO, describe the main 
features of the agr icu l ture  in d i f ferent  
countries.  They contain an average of 20 
sentences, which contain from i0 to 45 words. 
230 
The system used : 
- 400 lexical items, which represent 2400 words 
- 70 grammar ruies 
- a semantic network containing 220 concepts, 80 
of them being domain-dependant 
- 80 semantic ruIes for inference and reference 
solving 
- i text model, containing 50 paragraphs and 
subparagraphs 
- lO0 rules for text structuring 
- 30 sentence patterns for generation 
Our sys tem was ab le  to ext rac t  the 
s igni f icant  information that such a text 
conveys, and produce a new text from this 
information. As a matter of convenience, we used 
French as the target language for validation, 
however the process described here should also 
be able to work in a manner independant of the 
target language, by chaining certain parts of 
the knowledge base. 
Now, we are in the process of adapting our 
system to generate French appliance operation 
manuals from the corresponding ones.
