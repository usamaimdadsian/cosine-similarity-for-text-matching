Abstract
We present a novel approach for creat-
ing sense annotated corpora automatically.
Our approach employs shallow syntactico-
semantic patterns derived from linked lex-
ical resources to automatically identify in-
stances of word senses in text corpora. We
evaluate our labelling method intrinsically
on SemCor and extrinsically by using au-
tomatically labelled corpus text to train a
classifier for verb sense disambiguation.
Testing this classifier on verbs from the
English MASC corpus and on verbs from
the Senseval-3 all-words disambiguation
task shows that it matches the performance
of a classifier which has been trained on
manually annotated data.
1 Introduction
Sense annotated corpora are important resources
in NLP as they can be used as training data (e.g.,
for word sense disambiguation (WSD) or semantic
role labelling) or as sources for the acquisition of
lexical information (e.g., selectional preference in-
formation). Typically, a particular sense inventory
from a lexical resource is used to annotate some or
all words with word senses from this sense inven-
tory. For instance, various sense-annotated cor-
pora based on WordNet (WN; (Fellbaum, 1998))
exist, such as the data from the Senseval competi-
tions,
1
or the SemCor corpus.
2
Such corpora are
usually created manually which is expensive and
time consuming. Furthermore, the corpora are of-
ten domain specific (e.g. newspaper texts) which
makes statistical systems trained on them strongly
biased.
We present a novel approach for creating sense
annotated corpora automatically. Our approach

employs shallow syntactico-semantic patterns de-
rived from linked lexical resources (LLRs) to auto-
matically identify instances of word senses in text
corpora. We significantly extend previous work on
this task by making two important contributions:
(i) we employ a large-scale LLR for automatically
creating sense annotated data and (ii) we perform
meaningful intrinsic and application-based eval-
uations of our method on large sense annotated
datasets.
LLRs are the result of integrating several
lexical-semantic resources by linking them at the
word sense level. Examples of large LLRs are
the multilingual BabelNet (Navigli and Ponzetto,
2012), an integration of wordnets and Wikipedia
3
,
or UBY, (Gurevych et al., 2012), the resource we
employ in our work here. UBY is an integration of
multiple resources, such as wordnets, Wikipedia,
Wiktionary (WKT)
4
, FrameNet (FN; (Baker et al.,
1998)) and VerbNet (VN; (Kipper et al., 2008)) for
English and German.
A distinguishing feature of LLRs is the enriched
sense representation for word senses that are in-
terlinked since different resources provide differ-
ent, often complementary information. Annotat-
ing corpora with such enriched sense representa-
tions turns them into versatile training data for sta-
tistical systems.
Our first contribution (i) also addresses a con-
siderable gap in recent research regarding auto-
mated sense labelling of verbs. Most previous
work is done on nouns. However, verbs pose a
bigger challenge due to their high polysemy and
the fact that, unlike nouns, syntax is of crucial im-
portance because it often reflects particular aspects
of verb meaning. That is why, here we focus on
verbs and present results and evaluations for this
previously neglected part-of-speech (POS). Our
method, however, can be applied to other parts-of
3

68
speech as well.
Regarding (ii), we are the first to perform mean-
ingful intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations of auto-
matically labelled data on a larger scale. The in-
trinsic evaluation measures the performance of our
method on the manually annotated SemCor cor-
pus. The extrinsic evaluation compares the perfor-
mance of a classifier for verb sense disambigua-
tion (VSD) which has been trained (a) on auto-
matically sense labelled data and (b) on manually
annotated data. Both settings achieve very simi-
lar results which means that competitive VSD can
be performed without the need of costly manually
created training data. This could be beneficial in
languages (e.g., German, Spanish) for which elab-
orate lexical-semantic resources exist but large,
high-quality sense annotated corpora are unavail-
able. Moreover, we experiment with various link-
ings between lexical resources in order to inves-
tigate how different resource combinations affect
the performance of automated sense labelling. We
show that combining all available resources might
not be the best option.
The remainder of the paper is organised as fol-
lows. Section 2 presents our method. Section 3 de-
scribes the data used in the experiments. Section
4 presents the results of the evaluations. Section
5 analyses in detail the differences between our
method and previous work. Section 6 concludes
the paper.
2 Automated Labelling of Verb Senses
This section describes our novel approach for au-
tomated sense labelling of verbs in a corpus, which
exploits the added value of LLRs.
2.1 Approach
Our approach to automatically label corpus in-
stances of verb senses with sense identifiers from
an LLR is based on a pattern-based representation
of verb senses. Such patterns constitute a common
format for the representation of verb senses avail-
able in LLRs and verb instances found in corpora.
The common format we developed resembles a
syntactico-semantic clause pattern which we call
a sense pattern (SP). Based on a comparison of the
derived SPs by means of a similarity metric, verb
instances in a corpus can automatically be labelled
with sense identifiers from an LLR.
SPs can be derived from corpus instances and
from information given in LLRs, in particular,
sense examples and more abstract predicate argu-
ment structure information.
2.2 Step 1: Creation of SPs from LLRs
For the creation of SPs, we employ the large-scale
LLR UBY which combines 10 lexical resources
for English and German to make use of the en-
riched verb sense representations provided by the
sense links between various resources available in
UBY. Although our method can work with any
LLR, we choose UBY because the various re-
sources are represented in a standardised format
(Eckle-Kohler et al., 2012) and sense links be-
tween them can uniformly and conveniently be ac-
cessed via the freely available UBY-API.
5
Since we evaluate our method on data annotated
with WN senses, we create SPs for enriched WN
senses (see example given in Table 1). We enrich
WN senses by aggregating lexical information that
can be accessed through links given in UBY to
corresponding verb senses in other resources.
In this setting, enrichment means that we make
use of sense examples from WN, from FN via
the WN–FN linking, and from WKT via the
WN–WKT linking. In addition, we use ab-
stract predicate-argument structure information
from VN via the WN–VN linking (see Table 1).
6
For phrasal verb senses (e.g., write up) and
other verbal multiword expressions (e.g., know
what’s going on) listed in WN, UBY rarely pro-
vides links to other resources. Therefore, we in-
duced sense links by following the one sense per
collocation assumption.
7
Based on this assump-
tion, we linked each sense of a verbal multiword
verb lemma in WN with each sense of the same
multiword lemma in FN and WKT.
From sense examples, we derive two different
kinds of SPs. Based on a fragment of a sense ex-
ample given by a window w around the target verb
lemma we create: (i) lemma SPs (LSPs) consisting
only of lemmas (including the target verb) and (ii)
abstract SPs (ASPs) consisting of the target verb
lemma and items from a fixed, linguistically mo-
tivated vocabulary. This is based on the intuition
that LSPs are important to identify relatively fixed
5

6
Although VN is linked to sense examples given in the
PropBank corpus, the rationale behind using just abstract
predicate-argument structure information was to explore,
which effect this type of information has on the performance
of an automated labelling algorithm.
7
It assumes that nearby words provide strong and consis-
tent clues to the sense of a target word, see Yarowsky (1995).

verbal multiword expressions in a corpus, whereas
ASPs are necessary to identify productively used
verb senses that are constrained in their use only
by their syntactic behaviour and particular seman-
tic properties, such as selectional preferences on
their arguments.
The fixed vocabulary used for the creation of
ASPs consists of (i) the target verb lemma, (ii) se-
lected POS tags from the Penn Treebank Tagset
(Marcus et al., 1993), (iii) a list of particular func-
tion words that play an important role in fine-
grained subcategorisation frames of verbs (Eckle-
Kohler and Gurevych, 2012) and (iv) semantic cat-
egories of nouns given by WN semantic fields. We
selected POS tags that play an important role in
syntactic realisations of verbs, e.g. POS tags for
personal pronouns which are potential verb argu-
ments. In our experiments, we tried different sets
of function words and POS tags. For instance,
we found that some function words (e.g., reflex-
ive pronouns) and some POS tags (e.g., those for
past participles and comparative adjectives) intro-
duced too much noise in the data and therefore we
did not select them for the final vocabulary.
8
In order to create SPs from sense examples,
we apply POS tagging and lemmatisation using
the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) and named entity
tagging using the Stanford Named Entity Recog-
niser (Klein et al., 2003). The named entity
tags attached by the Named Entity Recogniser are
mapped to WN semantic fields.
For the generation of ASPs from sense exam-
ples, we used a window size of w = 7, while
the generation of LSPs has been performed with
w = 5 in order to put a focus on the closely neigh-
bouring lexemes in multiword verb lemmas. The
8

at http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/.
window size was set empirically using the English
Lexical Sample task of the Senseval-2 dataset as
a development set. The same set was also used
for the development of the linguistically motivated
vocabulary for ASPs.
9
From the abstract predicate-argument struc-
ture information given in VN, we derived only
ASPs. For this, we employed the subcategori-
sation frames, as well as the semantic role and
selectional preference information from VN, and
created ASPs based on manually created map-
pings between these information types and the
controlled vocabulary used for ASPs.
2.3 Step 2: Automated Labelling
For the automated labelling of verbs in a corpus,
we first derive SPs from each corpus sentence con-
taining a target verb. SPs are derived from corpus
sentences by applying the same procedure as de-
scribed in Step 1 for the creation of SPs from sense
examples, the window size used is w = 7.
To compare two SPs, we propose a similarity
metric based on Dice’s coefficient which calcu-
lates the sum of the weighted number of their com-
mon bi-grams, tri-grams, and four-grams. For-
mally, the similarity score sim
w
? [0..1] of two
SPs p

, p

is defined as:

9
However, the Senseval-2 data are annotated with sense
keys of the WN pre-release version 1.7 and therefore, we had
to employ an automated mapping of WN 1.7 pre-release to
WN 3.0 sense keys provided by Rada Mihalcea. Since this
mapping turned out to be rather noisy, we did not use the
Senseval-2 data in our evaluations.

w
is the nor-
malisation factor defined by the sum of the max-
imum number of common bigrams, trigrams and
fourgrams in the window w. Similarity metrics
based on Dice’s coefficient have often been used
in Lesk-based WSD (Lesk, 1986) to calculate the
overlap of two sets (e.g., Baldwin et al. (2010)). In
our case, however, the elements of the two sets are
bigrams, trigrams and fourgrams, while in Lesk-
based algorithms typically sets of unigrams are
compared, thus not accounting for word order.
Table 2 shows the algorithm used for automated
labelling of corpus instances in pseudo-code. The
algorithm assumes that for each verb v, the corre-
sponding set of SPs derived from UBY sense ex-
amples (UBY-LSP(v) and UBY-ASP(v) in Table
2) has already been computed.
For each corpus sentence containing a target
verb v, the corresponding SPs for verb v derived
from UBY are scored by the similarity metric in
(1). The SPs with the maximum score that is above
a threshold t form the set of most similar senses.
From this set, the algorithm picks one sense ran-
domly as a label. How often this happens, depends
on the value of t: the percentage of randomly se-
lected senses ranges from about 33% for t = 0.14
to about 50% for t = 0.04.
3 Data
Web corpora. For the automated labelling of cor-
pus data with WN senses, we use two very large
web corpora: the English ukWaC corpus (Ba-
roni et al., 2009) and the article pages extracted
from the English Wikipedia using the Java-based
Wikipedia API JWPL (Zesch et al., 2008). Fur-
ther, for the evaluation of our method, we use three
manually sense annotated data sets.
SemCor. We use the SemCor 3.0 corpus which
is annotated with WN 3.0 senses.
MASC. MASC is a balanced subset of 500K
words of written texts and transcribed speech
drawn primarily from the Open American Na-
tional Corpus (OANC).
10
The texts come from 19
different genres which allows us to test our method
on real-life data from multiple sources. The cor-
pus is annotated with various types of linguistic
information, including WN 3.0 sense annotations
for instances of selected words. Therefore, MASC
is a lexical sample corpus.
We extracted instances of 16 MASC verbs
(11,997 instances) which have been sense anno-
tated. Most instances are annotated by multiple
annotators and, to create a gold standard, we took
the sense preferred by the majority of annotators
and ignored instances where there were ties.
Senseval-3. In the test corpus of the Senseval-
3 all-words disambiguation task sense annotations
are provided for each content word in a chunk
of the WSJ corpus (5,000 words of running text).
The third annotated data set for our experiment is
formed by extracting all verb instances from this
test corpus. Note that the gold standard annota-
tions in Senseval-3 were made using WN 1.7.1.
In our experiments, we use Rada Mihalcea’s con-
version of the corpus to WN 3.0.
11
However, we
found out that some verb instances were converted
to sense labels that do not exist in WN 3.0. Af-
ter removing those instances, there were 305 verbs
with 592 instances left.
4 Experiments and Evaluation
Next, we present the intrinsic and the application-
based evaluations of our method.
4.1 Intrinsic Evaluation
We intrinsically evaluate the performance of the
automated labelling algorithm for the Senseval-3
verbs which occur in the SemCor corpus. Occur-
rences of these 152 verbs in SemCor are processed

by the labelling algorithm with a window size
w = 7 and the automatically annotated WN 3.0
senses are compared with the gold senses available
in SemCor 3.0.
Quantitative Evaluation. We calculated the
accuracy as the percentage of correctly labelled in-
stances and the instance coverage as the percent-
age of labelled instances. The sense coverage is
calculated as the percentage of all predicted (not
annotated) senses relative to all gold verb senses
given in SemCor.
A random sense baseline yields 15% accuracy.
Note that a MFS baseline based on WN would
not be meaningful, because the WordNet MFS is
based on the frequency distribution of annotated
senses in SemCor.
Table 3 shows accuracy and coverage results
of the automated labelling algorithm for different
values of the threshold t and two combinations of
sense links from UBY. Depending on the threshold
t, 2% to 55% of the verb instances in SemCor can
automatically be labelled, and the instance cov-
erage goes largely in parallel to the coverage of
predicted WN senses. Accuracy ranges between
32% and 47% and exceeds the random sense base-
line by a large margin. Lowering the threshold in-
creases the coverage of the labelling method, but
it also leads to a decrease in accuracy of 9 percent-
age points (12 for the configuration with VN).
Adding more patterns from VN via the WN–
VN alignment, leads to a decrease in both instance
and sense coverage combined with an increase in
accuracy. Since SemCor is a rather small corpus,
the increase in instance coverage is not as clear
as for large Web corpora such as the ukWaC cor-
pus. Labelling a 1GB subset of the ukWaC cor-
pus based on patterns derived from the WN–FN–
WKT alignments resulted in 15MB of labelled
data, whereas 25MB labelled data could be created
from the same subset with the additional patterns
from the WN–VN alignment.
Qualitative Analysis. In Table 4, we show ex-
amples of the highest ranking patterns and the cor-
responding labelled SemCor instances for senses
that were correctly and falsely annotated. The ex-
amples in Table 4 show that the similarity metric
assigns the highest values to instances where func-
tion words (e.g., in, to, who) or POS tags (e.g., PP,
VV) from the ASP vocabulary occur in the im-
mediate neighbourhood of the target verb. Since
such functions words play an important role in the
ASPs derived from VN, the VN ASPs possibly
tend to dominate over the SPs derived from sense
examples, which explains the observed decrease in
coverage (see Table 3).
The falsely labelled instances turn out to be ex-
amples of WN senses where the gold sense is very
similar to the automatically attached sense as evi-
dent from the synset definition given in the right-
most column.
4.2 Extrinsic Evaluation
We extrinsically evaluate our method for auto-
mated verb sense labelling by using it for learning
a classifier for VSD in a train-test setting. We use
features which have been widely used in super-
vised WSD systems, in particular features based
on dependency parsing. While this might seem
to be in contrast to our labelling algorithm which
is based on shallow linguistic preprocessing, it is
fully justified by the purpose of our extrinsic eval-
uation: The main purpose of the extrinsic evalua-
tion is not to outperform state-of-the-art VSD sys-
tems, but to show that, when operating with rea-
sonable features, a classifier trained on the data
automatically labelled with our method performs
equally well as when this classifier is trained on
manually annotated data.
4.2.1 Features
The training and test data are parsed with the Stan-
ford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) which pro-
vides Stanford Dependencies output (De Marneffe
et al., 2006) as well as phrase structure trees. We
employ the Stanford Named Entity Recogniser to
identify named entities. We then extract lexical,
syntactic, and semantic features from the parse re-
sults for classification.
Lexical features include the lemmas and POS
tags of the two words before and after the tar-
get verb. To extract syntactic features we select
all dependency relations from the parser output in

which the target verb is related to a noun, a pro-
noun, or a named entity. For each selected word,
the lemma of the word (or the named entity tag in
case of proper nouns) is combined with the type
of the dependency relation which exists between
it and the verb to form a separate feature. In a
similar feature, the lemma of the selected word is
replaced by its POS tag. The semantic features
include all synsets found in WN for nominal argu-
ments of the verb. Personal pronouns are mapped
to ‘person’ and the three synsets found in WN 3.0
for this word are taken as features.
4.2.2 Train and Test Data
Using exactly the same method as intrinsically
evaluated in section 4.1, we automatically labelled
occurrences of the 16 MASC verbs and the 305
Senseval-3 verbs in both web corpora with WN
senses. Only occurrences with similarity score
above 0.1 are labelled – all other occurrences are
discarded. We refer to the resulting data as au-
tomatically labelled corpus (ALC) and use it as
training data for statistical VSD.
Instances of the test verbs found in SemCor are
also used as training data in order to compare the
performance of the classifier in a fully supervised
setting.
MASC. There are 22 senses with instances in
MASC which are not found in SemCor. For the
ALC this number is 34. However, in the latter
there are 27 senses, instances of which are un-
seen in MASC. 20 of those represent phrasal verbs
which we attribute to the special treatment of such
verbs in our method.
The classifier cannot correctly classify senses
which are not seen in the training data. The cov-
erage of the ALC is 88.05% and that of SemCor
— 94.8%. The SemCor data can mainly cover
more test instances of 3 verbs — launch, rule, and
transfer — the WN senses of which lack sense
examples or links to other senses in UBY. Un-
like the hand-labelled SemCor data, our automated
sense labelling method is limited to the informa-
tion found in the LLR used. However, there are
also 330 MASC instances covered by the ALC
only. Those are mostly instances of phrasal verbs,
such as rip off and show up. Note that the defini-
tion of coverage we use here makes its values the
upper bounds for the performance of the classifier.
Senseval-3. We also generated training data au-
tomatically for the 305 Senseval verbs. However,
only 152 of those verbs (442 instances) are found
in SemCor. This means we cannot train the classi-
fier for the remaining Senseval verbs. The cover-
age of the SemCor training data for the 152 verbs
which can be classified is 96.15% and that of the
ALC — 95.25%. For all 592 Senseval test in-
stances, the coverage of the ALC is 90.38%.
4.2.3 Results and Analysis
We trained a separate logistic regression classi-
fier for each test verb in the two datasets us-
ing the WEKA data mining software (Hall et al.,
2009) with default parameters. The classifiers
were trained with features extracted from (i) the
SemCor hand-labelled data and (ii) the ALC.
MASC. The classifier achieves 50.23% accu-
racy when SemCor is used and 49% when the
ALC is employed. The difference in the results is
not statistically significant at p < 0.05. The MFS
73
baseline scores at 41.72%.
Senseval-3. The classifier achieves 43.24%
with the ALC. We assigned the MFS to each of
the 143 test verbs not found in SemCor since we
cannot train the classifier for those. The achieved
accuracy is 45.2%. We also measured accuracy
in a setup where no MFS back-off strategy was
employed for SemCor (152 test verbs with 442
instances). When trained on SemCor data, the
classifier achieves 48.64% accuracy compared to
47.51% for the ALC. All differences in the results
are not statistically significant at p < 0.05. Fi-
nally, the MFS baseline accuracy is significantly
lower at 25.34% for all 305 test verbs.
For both test datasets, the overall performance
of the classifier when trained on automatically la-
belled data is very close to the setting in which
manually created training data is employed. We
thus conclude that the quality of the data produced
by our sense labelling method is sufficient and
these data can be directly used for training a statis-
tical VSD classifier. As a reference, the state-of-
the-art supervised VSD system described in Chen
and Palmer (2009) achieves 64.8% accuracy on the
Senseval-2 fine-grained data. However, we cannot
compare to this result due to the different sense in-
ventory which the Senseval-2 data were annotated
with.
4.2.4 Sense Links
In order to investigate the effect of LLRs, we
performed experiments in which sense examples
found in WN only were used. We also experi-
mented with various combinations of the resources
available in UBY to determine the contribution of
each of those to our method. Table 5 shows the re-
sults. The setting which includes only WN has the
worst performance, thus clearly showing the ben-
efits of using LLRs. Next, the inclusion of WKT
improves both coverage and accuracy. We con-
clude that WKT plays an important role in discov-
ering additional verb senses. Finally, similarly to
the results of the intrinsic evaluation, adding VN
to the mix increases slightly the coverage but de-
creases accuracy.
5 Related Work and Discussion
Our work is related to previous research on
(i) using a combination of lexical resources for
knowledge-based WSD, (ii) using lexical re-
sources for distant supervision, and (iii) the auto-
mated acquisition of sense-annotated data.

of lexical resources.
Knowledge-based WSD. While the combina-
tion of sense-annotated data and wordnets has
been described for knowledge-based WSD before
(e.g., Navigli and Velardi (2005; Agirre and Soroa
(2009) who use graph algorithms), only recently
Ponzetto and Navigli (2010) have investigated the
impact of the combination of different lexical re-
sources on the performance of WSD. They aligned
WN senses with Wikipedia articles and employed
two simple knowledge-based algorithms, i.e., a
Lesk-based algorithm and a graph-based algo-
rithm, to evaluate the resulting LLR for WSD.
While their evaluation demonstrates that the use
of an LLR boosts the performance of knowledege-
based WSD, it is restricted to nouns only since
Wikipedia provides very few verb senses. More-
over, lexical resources that are rich in lexical-
syntactic information such as VN have not been
involved.
Miller et al. (2012) employ a Lesk-based algo-
rithm which makes use of a combination of WN
and an automatically acquired distributional the-
saurus. Lesk-based algorithms play a central role
in knowledge-based WSD. Based on the overlap
of the context of the target word and sense defi-
nitions in a given sense inventory, they assign the
sense with the highest overlap as disambiguation
result. We were kindly provided with the system
described in Miller et al. (2012) and we were able
to test its performance on our test sets. The sys-
tem achieved only 33.86% and 30.16% accuracy
for the MASC and the Senseval-3 verbs, respec-
tively, which is far below the results we presented.
This low performance is due to the fact that Lesk-
based algorithms do not account for word order.
Such information is important especially for verb
senses, as the syntactic behaviour of a verb reflects
aspects of its meaning.
Distant supervision. Distant supervision is
a learning paradigm similar to semi-supervised
learning. Unlike semi-supervised methods which
typically employ a supervised classifier and a
74
small number of seed instances to do bootstrap
learning (Yarowsky, 1995; Mihalcea, 2004; Fujita
and Fujino, 2011), in distant supervision training
data are created in a single run from scratch by
aligning corpus instances with entries in a knowl-
edge base. Distant supervision methods that have
used LLRs as knowledge bases have been previ-
ously applied in relation extraction, e.g. Freebase
(Mintz et al., 2009; Surdeanu et al., 2012) and Ba-
belNet (Krause et al., 2012; Moro et al., 2013).
However, as far as we are aware, we are the first to
apply distant supervision to the task of verb sense
disambiguation.
Acquisition of sense-annotated data. Most
previous work on using lexical resources for au-
tomatically acquiring sense-annotated data either
was mostly restricted to noun senses or, unlike
us, did not present a meaningful evaluation. Lea-
cock et al. (1998) describe the automated creation
of training data for supervised WSD on the ba-
sis of WN as a lexical resource combined with
corpus statistics, but they evaluate their approach
just on one noun, verb, and adjective, and thus
it is unclear whether their results can be gener-
alized. Cuadros and Rigau (2008) used the ap-
proach of Leacock et al. (1998) to automatically
build a large KnowNet from the Web, but they
evaluated this resource only for WSD of nouns.
However, the system based on KnowNet yields re-
sults below the SemCor-MFS baseline. Mihalcea
and Moldovan (1999) use WordNet glosses to ex-
tract sense examples from the Web via a search en-
gine and use this approach in a subsequent paper
(Mihalcea, 2002) to generate a sense tagged cor-
pus. For five randomly selected nouns, they per-
formed a comparative evaluation of a WSD classi-
fier trained on an automatically tagged corpus on
the one hand, and on the manually annotated data
from the Senseval-2 English lexical sample task
on the other hand. The results obtained for these
five nouns seem to be similar but the dataset used
is too small to draw meaningful conclusions and
moreover, it does not cover verbs. Mostow and
Duan (2011) presented a system that extracts ex-
ample contexts for nouns and apply these contexts
in (Duan and Yates, 2010) for WSD by using them
to label text and train a statistical classifier. An
evaluation of this classifier yielded results similar
to those obtained by a supervised WSD system.
K¨ubler and Zhekova (2009) extract example
sentences from several English dictionaries and
various types of corpora, including web corpora.
They employ a Lesk-based algorithm to automati-
cally annotate the target word instances in the ex-
tracted example sentences with WN senses and
use them in one of their experiments as train-
ing data for a WSD classifier. However, the per-
formance of the system decreased significantly
achieving the lowest accuracy among all system
configurations. The authors provide only the over-
all accuracy score, so we do not know how disam-
biguation of verbs was affected.
Summary. We consider the ability to estab-
lish a link between the rich knowledge available in
LLRs and corpora of any kind to be the main ad-
vantage of our automated labelling method. How-
ever, to automatically label a suffcient amount
of data for supervised learning, very large cor-
pora are required. Our method can be extended
to other POS (using sense examples and possibly
other types of lexical information), as well as to
other languages where (linked) lexical resources
are available.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a novel method for cre-
ating sense labelled corpora automatically. We ex-
ploit LLRs and perform large-scale intrinsic and
application-based evaluations. The results of those
evaluations show that the quality of the sense la-
belled corpora created with our method matches
that of manually annotated corpora.
In future research, we plan to use PropBank
(Palmer et al., 2005) in order to extract sense
examples for VN as well. This might improve
the performance of lexical resource combinations
which include VN. We will also apply our method
to languages (e.g., German) for which lexical re-
sources are available but no or little sense anno-
tated corpora exist.
