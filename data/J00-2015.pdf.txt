Teich's book will be of interest o three groups of readers. First, specialists in Systemic 
Functional Grammar (SFG) will find a detailed escription of the use of SFG theory for 
a specific application, a discussion of some fundamental problems in the theory that are 
revealed by the application, and proposals for a modification of SFG theory to handle 
these problems. Second, those working in natural anguage generation (NLG) will find 
a detailed discussion of why SFG is effective for NLG, an interesting comparison of 
the SFG-based Penman system with three other generation systems, and a description 
of a fully implemented SFG-based surface realization system for German. 
The third group is less likely to read the book, but I recommend it to specialists in 
Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). After identifying some fundamen- 
tal problems in SFG theory, the author explains that these problems have been fully 
solved in HPSG. However, rather than abandoning SFG and adopting HPSG, the au- 
thor prefers to try to integrate the HPSG-style solutions into the existing SFG theory. 
This conviction that the wider SFG framework has major advantages, o significant 
that they outweigh the identified problems, should be respected as deeply challenging 
for HPSG theory. 
The basic approach to NLG, using SFG and the Penman system, has already been 
described in an earlier book (Matthiessen and Bateman 1991) from the same series, 
with examples from English and Japanese. Teich's distinctive contributions are the 
development of a large SFG-based grammar for German using the KOMET-Penman 
system, and a detailed analysis of the problems encountered due to the absence of any 
notion of head-daughter dependency within SFG theory. Comparing SFG and HPSG, 
Teich proposes a modification of SFG theory to allow the inclusion of dependency 
relations. 
Chapter 1, "Introduction", presents the motivation for the book. The terminology 
used within SFG theory sometimes appears to be unnecessarily daunting. For example, 
we learn on p. 3 that the background is "linguistic theory as metasemiosis." 
Chapter 2, "Theory and linguistic representation: Systemic functional linguistics," 
is intended as a short introduction to SFG theory. This is very well written for SFG 
specialists, but it covers an enormous amount of ground at great speed (even sum- 
marizing the theoretical differences between Hudson, Huddleston, Henrici, Halliday, 
Fawcett, and Berry) and is unsuitable as a first introduction to SFG. Instead, I recom- 
mend Berry (1975 and 1977). Although this old textbook was never intended to be 
used for any computational implementation, it gives a very clear account of how SFG 
actually works, and is especially good on realization rules.

Chapter 3, "Computational pplication: Grammar models in natural anguage gen- 
eration," presents an interesting comparison of four different approaches to the use 
of grammars in surface generation: SFG in Penman, Meaning-Text Theory in GOS- 
SIP, Functional Unification Grammar in COMET, and Tree Adjoining Grammar in 
Mumble-86 and SPOKESMAN. 
As Teich points out, the key issue for SFG-based generators i  when to choose 
which features from the system network. These decisions are taken in Penman by 
choosers, but the description of choosers (pp. 63-65) is obscure. In the example given 
(Figure 3.7), the PROCESS-TYPE chooser starts with an unexplained choice of static/non- 
static. This turns out to be irrelevant for verbal and mental processes, while it is the only 
distinction between relational and material processes. Why not call it material/non- 
material? A more interesting issue here concerning the "generation gap" is the rela- 
tionship between the Penman Upper Model ontology and these distinctions required 
by the grammar. 
Chapter 4, "Description: A systemic functional grammar of German for natural 
language generation," gives a detailed description of the SFG-based grammar of Ger- 
man developed in KOMET. Although the details are mainly of interest for those work- 
ing on German, this work has a wider significance as Teich accumulates evidence of 
the need for a head-dependency mechanism in SFG. The problems include govern- 
ment and case assignment in the clause, and lexical gender agreement in the noun 
group, which are highlighted in German but can be largely functionally motivated in 
English. 
Chapter 5, "Computational representation: A proposal for dependency in sys- 
temic functional grammar," is, despite its title, mainly a discussion of noncomputa- 
tional issues in grammatical theory. Teich describes the strengths of HPSG in handling 
head-dependency relations, and proposes a mechanism to support dependency in 
SFG. However, this proposal has important computational implications, as it includes 
reimplementing SFG in terms of typed feature structures, the formal basis underly- 
ing HPSG. Several computational systems for typed feature structures are listed, but 
the valuable work of Erbach (1994) (based on earlier work by Mellish) on multidi- 
mensional inheritance and typed feature structures for both SFG and HPSG is not 
mentioned. 
Chapter 6, "Summary and conclusions," very briefly compares the strengths and 
weaknesses of SFG and HPSG, which are viewed as complementary. The discussion is 
theoretical and does not cover practical contributions such as the eclectic ombination 
of ideas from SFG and HPSG in the SURGE generator (Elhadad and Robin 1996). 
The book will be valuable to SFG specialists, and will also be of interest to 
others working in NLG, as it presents ignificant contributions in both fields. The 
suggested wider potential for synergy between SFG and HPSG remains to be ex- 
plored.
