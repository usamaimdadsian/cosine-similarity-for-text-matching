Proper nouns form an open class, making the incompleteness of manually or automatically earned 
classification rules an obvious problem. The purpose of this paper is twofold:first, o suggest the use 
of a complementary "backup" method to increase the robustness of any hand-crafted ormachine- 
learning-based NE tagger; and second, to explore the effectiveness of using more fine-grained 
evidence--namely, s ntactic and semantic ontextual knowledge--in classifying NEs. 
1. Proper Noun Classification 
In this paper we present a corpus-driven statistical technique that uses a learning 
corpus to acquire contextual classification cues, and then uses the results of this 
phase to classify unrecognized proper nouns (PN) in an unlabeled corpus. Training 
examples of proper nouns are obtained using any available named entity (NE) recog- 
nizer (in our experiments we used a rule-based recognizer and a machine-learning- 
based recognizer). The contextual model of PN categories i learned without supervi- 
sion. 
The approach described in this paper is complementary to current methods for 
NE recognition: our objective is to improve, without additional manual effort, the 
robustness of any available NE system through the use of more "fine-grained" con- 
textual knowledge, best exploited at a relatively late stage of analysis. The method is 
particularly useful when an available NE system must be rapidly adapted to another 
language or to another domain, provided the shift is not dramatic. 
Furthermore, our study provides experimental evidence relating to two issues 
still under debate: i) the effectiveness, in practical NLP applications, of using syntactic 
relations (most systems use plain collocations and morphological features), and ii) 
context expansion based on thesauri. While we do not provide a definitive argument 
in favor of syntactic ontexts and semantic expansion for word sense disambiguation 
tasks in general, we do show that they can be successfully used for unknown proper 
noun classification. Proper nouns have particular characteristics, such as low or zero 
ambiguity, which makes it easier to characterize their contexts. 
2. Description of the U_PN Classification Method 
In this section we briefly summarize the corpus-based tagging technique for the classi- 
fication of unknown proper nouns (for more details, see Cucchiarelli, Luzi, and Velardi 
\[1998\]).

2.1 Learning Contextual Sense Indicators 
Our method proceeds as follows: first, by means of any available NE recognition 
technique (which we will call an early NE classifier), at least some examples of PNs in 
each category are detected. Second, through an unsupervised corpus-based technique, 
typical PN syntactic and semantic contexts are learned. Syntactic and semantic cues can 
then be used to extend the coverage of the early NE classifier, increasing its robustness 
to the limitations of the gazetteers (PN dictionaries) and domain shifts. 
In phase one, a learning corpus in the application domain is morphologically 
processed. The gazetteer lookup and the early NE classifier are then used to detect 
PNs. At the end of this phase, "some" PNs are recognized and classified, depending 
upon the size of the gazetteer and the actual performance (in the domain) of the NE 
classifier. 
In phase two, the objective is to learn a contextual model of each PN category, 
augmented with syntactic and semantic features. Since the algorithm is unsupervised, 
statistical techniques are applied to smooth the weight of acquired examples as a 
function of semantic and syntactic ambiguity. 1 
Syntactic processing is applied over the corpus. A shallow parser (see details in 
Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi \[1994\]) extracts from the learning corpus elementary syn- 
tactic relations such as Subject-Object, Noun-Preposition-Noun, etc. 2 An elementary 
syntactic link (esl) is represented as: 
esl(wi, mod( typei, Wk ) ) 
where wj is the headword, Wk is the modifier, and type i is the type of syntactic relation 
(e.g. Prepositional Phrase, Subject-Verb, Verb-Direct-Object, e c.). For example, esl(close 
mod(G_N_V_Act Xerox)) reads: Xerox is the modifier of the head close in a Subject-Verb 
(G_N_V_Act) syntactic relation. 
In our study, the context of a word w in a sentence S is represented by the esls 
including w as one of its arguments (wj or Wk). The esls that include semantically 
classified PNs as one of their arguments are grouped in a database, called PN_esl. 
This database provides contextual evidence for assigning a category to unknown PNs. 
2.2 Tagging Unknown PNs 
A corpus-driven algorithm is used to classify unknown proper nouns recognized as 
such, but not semantically classified by the early NE recognizer. 3 
• Let U_PN be an unknown proper noun, i.e., a single word or a complex 
nominal. Let Cpn = (Cp~l, Cpn2 . . . . .  CpnN) be the set of semantic ategories 
for proper nouns (e.g. Person, Organization, Product, etc.). Finally, let 
ESL be the set of esls (often more than one in a text) that include U_PN 
as one of their arguments. 
• For each esli in ESL let: 
esli( wj, mod( typei, Wk )) = esli( x, U_PN) 
1 We say the algorithm is unsupervised because neither the NE items detected by the early recognizer 
nor the extracted syntactic ontexts are inspected for correctness. 
2 Shallow, or partial parsers are a well-established technique for corpus parsing. Several partial parsers 
are readily available---for example, the freely downloadable LINK parser. 
3 A standard POS tagger augmented with simple heuristics is used to detect possible instances of PNs. 
Errors are originated only by ambiguous entence beginners, as "Owens Illinois" or "Boots Plc" 
causing partial recognition. 
124 
Cucchiarelli and Velardi Unsupervised Named Entity Recognition 
where x = w\] or x = Wk and U-PN=wk or wj (the unknown PN can be 
either the head or the modifier), type i is the syntactic type of esl (e.g. 
N-of-N, NAN, V-for-N, etc.), and furthermore l t: 
pl(esli(x, U_PN) ) 
be the plausibi l i ty of a detected esl. Plausibility is a measure of the 
statistical evidence of a detected syntactic relation (Basili, Marziali, and 
Pazienza 1994; Grishman and Sterling 1994) that depends upon local 
(i.e., sentence-level) syntactic ambiguity and global corpus evidence. The 
plausibility accounts for the uncertainty arising from syntactic ambiguity. 
,. Finally, let: 
- -  ESLA be a set of esls in PN_esl (the previously learned 
contextual model) defined as follows: for each esli(x, Uff)N) in 
ESL, put in ESLA the set of eslj(x, PNj) with typej = type i, x in 
the same position as esli, and PNj a known proper noun, in 
the same position as U_PN in esli. 
ESLB be a set of esls in PN_esl defined as follows: for each 
esli(x, U_PN) in ESL put in ESLB the set of eslj(w, PNj) with 
type\] -- type i, w in the same position as x in esli, Sim(w,x) > 6, 
and PNj a known proper noun, in the same position as U_PN 
in esli. Sim(w, x) is a similarity measure between x and w. In 
our experiments, Sim(w,x) > ~ iff w and x have a common 
hyperonym H in WordNet. The generality of H (i.e., the 
number of levels from x to H) is made parametric, to analyze 
the effect of generalization. 
• For each semantic ategory Cp,j compute vidence(Cp,j) as: 
E weightq (x)D(x, C(PNj)) 
esliC ESLA,C( PNj)=Cpn j 
evidence(Cp~j) = a + 
E weight~j (x)D(x, C(PNj)) 
esliEESLA 
E weightq (x)D(x, C(PNj)) 
esli E ESLB,C( PNj) =Cpn j fl 
E weightiy(x)D(x'C(PNJ )) 
esli6 ESLB 
where: 
weightq(x) = weight q( esli(x, PNj) ) = pl( esli(x, PNj) ) • (1 - ~(~)-1~_1 , 
u weightij(w ) = weightij(esli(w, PNj) ) = pl(esli(w, PNj)). (1 - amb(w)-l~k_\] 2 
pl(esli(x, PNj)) is the plausibility and arab(x) is the ambiguity 
of x in esli 
k is a constant factor used to incrementally reduce the influence 
of ambiguous words. The smoothing is tuned to be higher in 
ESLB 
a and fl are parametric, and can be used to study the evidence 
provided by ESLA and ESLB 
125 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 
D(x, C(PNj)) is a discrimination factor used to determine the 
saliency (Yarowsky 1992) of a context esli(x, _) for a category 
C(PNj), i.e., how good a context is at discriminating between 
C(PNj)and the other categories. 4 
The selected category for U~N is 
C = argmax(evidence(Cp~k)) 
When grouping all the evidence of a U_PN in a text, the underlying hypothesis i
that, in a given linguistic domain (finance, medicine, etc.), a PN has a unique sense. This 
is a reasonable restriction for Proper Nouns, supported by empirical evidence, though 
we would be more skeptical about the applicability of the one-sense-per-discourse 
paradigm (Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992) to generic words. We believe that it is 
precisely this restriction that makes the use of syntactic and semantic ontexts effective 
for PNs. 
Notice that the formula of the evidence has several smoothing factors that work to- 
gether to reduce the influence of unreliable or uninformative contexts. The formula also 
has parameters (k, ~, fl), estimated by running systematic experiments. Standard sta- 
tistical techniques have been used to balance xperimental conditions and the sources 
of variance. 
3. Using WordNet for Context Generalization 
One of the stated objectives of this paper is to investigate the effect of context gen- 
eralization (the addend ESLB in the formula of the evidence) on our sense tagging 
task. 
The use of on-line thesauri for context generalization has already been investigated 
with limited success (Hearst and Schuetze 1993; Brill and Resnik 1994; Resnik 1997; 
Agirre and Rigau 1996). Though the idea of using thesauri for context expansion is 
quite common, there are no clear indications that this is actually useful in terms of 
performance. However, studying the effect of context expansion for a PN tagging task 
in particular is relevant because: 
PNs may be hypothesized to have a unique sense in a text, and even in a 
domain corpus. Therefore, we can reliably consider as potential sense 
indicators all the contexts in which a PN appears. The only source of 
ambiguity is then the word wi co-occurring in a syntactic ontext with a 
PN, esli(wi, U_PN), but since in ESLB we group several contexts, 
hopefully spurious hyperonyms of wi will gain lower evidence. For 
example, consider the context "division of Americand3randsdnc". Division 
is a highly ambiguous word, but, when generalizing it, the majority of 
its senses appearing in the same type of syntactic relation with a Proper 
Noun (e.g. branch of Drexel_ Burnhamd,ambert_Group dnc, part of Nationale_ 
Nederlanden_Group) are indeed pertinent senses. 
4 For example, a Subject_Verb phrase with the verb make (e.g., Ace made acontract) isfound with almost 
equal probability with Person and Organization names. We used a simple conditional probability 
model for D(x, c(PNj)), but we believe that more refined measures could improve performance. 
126 
Cucchiarelli and Velardi Unsupervised Named Entity Recognition 
• PN categories (e.g., Person, Location, Product) exhibit a more stable and 
less ambiguous contextual behavior than other more vague categories, 
such as psychological_feature. 5 
• We can study the degree of generalization at which an opt imum 
performance is achieved. 
4. Experimental Discussion 
The purpose of experimental evaluation is twofold: 
To test the improvement in robustness of a state-of-the-art NE recognizer. 
To study the effectiveness of syntactic ontexts and of a "cautious" 
context generalization on the performance of the U_PN tagger, analyzed 
in isolation. The effect of generalization is studied by gradually relaxing 
the notion of similarity in the formula of evidence and by tuning, 
through the factors a and fl, the contribution of generalized contexts to 
the formula of evidence. 
In our experiment, we used the Italian Sole24Ore half-million-word corpus on 
financial news, the one-mill ion-word Wall Street Journal corpus, and WordNet, as stan- 
dard on-line available resources, as well as a series of computational tools made avail- 
able for our research: 
• the VIE system (Humphreys et al. 1996) for initial detection of Proper 
Nouns from the learning corpus; for the same purpose we also used a 
machine learning method based on decision lists, described in Paliouras, 
Karkaletsis, and Spyropolous (1998). 
• the SSA shallow syntactic analyzer (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1994) 
for surface corpus parsing. 6
• the tool described in Cucchiarelli and Velardi (1998) for corpus-driven 
WordNet pruning. 7
4.1 Experiment 1: Improving Robustness of NE Recognizers 
The objective of Experiment 1 is to verify the improvement in robustness of existing 
NE recognizers, through the use of our tagger. In Figure 1, three testing experiments 
are shown. The table measures the local performance of the NE tagging task achieved 
by the early NE recognizer, by our untrained tagger, and finally, the joint performance 
of the two methods. 
In the first test, we used the Italian Sole24Ore corpus. Due to the unavailability of 
WordNet in Italian, we used a dictionary of strict synonyms for context expansion. In 
this test, we "loosely" adapted the English VIE system (as used in MUC-6) to Italian. 
5 In Velardi and Cucchiarelli (2000) we formally studied the relation between category type and 
learnability of contextual cues for WSD. 
6 We also used the GATE partial parser. We were not as successful with this parser because it is not 
designed for high-performance VP3?P and NP-PP detection, but prepositional contexts are often the 
most informative indicators. 
7 This method produces a20-30% reduction of the initial WordNet ambiguity, depending on the specific 
corpus.

Outline of results on the Sole24Ore corpus. 
We used the English gazetteer as it was and we appl ied simple " language porting" to 
the NE grammar  (e.g., replacing English words and preposit ions with corresponding 
Italian words, and little more), s This justifies the low performance of the rule-based 
classifier. Note that our context-based tagger produces a considerable improvement  in
performance (around 18%), therefore the global performance (column K and L) turns 
out to be comparable with state-of-the-art systems, without a significant readaptation 
effort. 
In the second test, we used again VIE, on the English Wall Street Journal corpus. 
We used a version of VIE that was designed to detect NE in a management  succession 
domain (we are testing the effect of a domain shift here). Local performance was 
somewhat  lower than in MUC-6. Again, we measured a 9% improvement  using our 
tagger, and very high global performance. 
The third test was the most demanding. Here, we used only half of the named 
entity gazetteer used in previous experiments. The purpose of this test was also to 
verify the effect on performance of a poorly populated gazetteer. In this test, rather than 
using LASIE, we used a machine learning method described in Paliouras, Karkaletsis 
and Spyropolous (1998). This method uses as a training set the available half of the 
gazetteer to learn a context-based decision list for NE classification. 
As shown in Test 3, column B, the initial number  of PNs in the test corpus is now 
considerably higher. The decision-list classifier is tuned to classify with high precision 
and lower recall. Therefore, only the "hardest" cases are submitted to our untrained 
classifier. In fact, local performance of our classifier is around 10% lower than for pre- 
vious tests, but nevertheless, global performance (in terms of joint precision and recall) 
shows an improvement.  Finally, we observe that the performance figures reported in 
Figure 1 say nothing about the various sources of errors. Errors and misses occur both 
during the off-line learning phase (as we said, NE instances and syntactic contexts 
8 Most location and company names known worldwide (e.g., NewYork, IBM) are in fact mentioned in 
economic journals regardless of the language. 
128

are not inspected for correctness, therefore the contextual knowledge base is error 
prone) and prior to the U_PN tagging phase: a compound PN may be incompletely 
recognized uring POS tagging, causing the generation of an uninformative syntactic 
context (e.g., "Owens Illinois" at the beginning of a sentence is recognized as "owens 
Illinois", causing a spurious NdN(owen,Illinois) context o be generated). 
Because all these "external" sources of noise are not filtered out, we may then 
reliably conclude that our tagger is effective at improving the robustness of proper 
noun classification, though clearly the amount of improvement depends upon the 
baseline performances of the early method used for PN classification. 
Although the classification evidence provided by syntactic ontexts is somewhat 
noise prone, it proves to be useful as a "backup," when other "simpler" contextual 
evidence does not allow a reliable decision. 
4.2 Effectiveness of Syntactic and Semantic Cues for Semantic Classification 
In a second experiment, we used the experimental set up of Test 2 (WSJ+VIE described 
above) to evaluate the effectiveness of context expansion on system performance. We 
applied a pruning method on WordNet (Cucchiarelli and Velardi 1998) to reduce initial 
ambiguity of contexts. This pruning method allowed an average of 27% reduction in 
the initial ambiguity of the total number of the 13,428 common nouns in the Wall 
Street Journal corpus. The objective of this experiment was to allow a more detailed 
evaluation of our method, with respect o several parameters. 
We built four test sets with the same distribution of PN categories and frequency 
distribution as in the application corpus. We selected four frequency ranges (1, 2, 3-9, 
> 10) and in each range we selected 100 PNs, reflecting the frequency distribution 
in the corpus of the three main PN semantic ategories--Person, Organization, and 
Location. We then built another test set, called TSAll, with 400 PNs again reflecting the 
frequency and category distribution of the corpus. The 400 PNs were then removed 
from the set of 37,018 esls extracted by our parser and from the gazetteer (whenever 
included). 
In this experiment, we wanted to measure the performance of the U_PN tagger 
over the 400 words in the test set, in terms of F-measure, according to several varying 
factors: 
• the category type; 
• the amount of initial contextual evidence (i.e., the frequency range, 
reflected by the different test sets); 
• the factors oe and fl, i.e., the influence of local and generalized contexts; 
• the level of generalization L. 
Figures 2 summarizes the results of the experiment. Figure 2(a) shows the increase 
in performance as a function of the values of oe and fl and the generalization level. N 
means no generalization, only the evidence provided by ESLA is computed; 0 means 
that ESLB collects the evidence provided by contexts in which w is a strict synonym of 
x according to WordNet; 1, 2, and 3 refer to incremental levels of generalization in the 
(pruned) WordNet hierarchy. The figure shows that context generalization produces up 
to 7% improvement in performance. Best results are obtained with L = 2 and ~ = 0.7, 
fl = 0.3. Further generalization may cause a drop in performance. High ambiguity is 
the cause of this behavior, despite WordNet pruning (without WordNet pruning, we 
observed a performance inversion at level 1; this experiment is not reported ue to

limitations of space). Figure 2(b) illustrates the influence of initial contextual evidence. 
Recognition of singleton PNs remains almost constant as the contribution of gener- 
alized and nongeneralized contexts varies. Looking more in detail, we observe that 
recall increases with fl -- (1 -  c~), but precision decreases. Generalization on the basis of 
a unique context does not allow any filtering of spurious senses, while when grouping 
several contexts, spurious senses gain lower evidence (as anticipated in Section 3). 
Finally, we designed an experiment to evaluate the influence of the test set com- 
position on the U_PN tagger performances. We performed an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA test \[Hoel 1971\]) on the results obtained by processing nine different est 
sets of 400 PNs each, selected randomly. In all our experiments the details of which 
we omit, for lack of space), we found that the U-PN tagging method performances 
were independent of the variations of the test set.
