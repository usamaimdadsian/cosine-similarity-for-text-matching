Abstract
Translation Memory (TM) systems are
one of the most widely used translation
technologies. An important part of TM
systems is the matching algorithm that de-
termines what translations get retrieved
from the bank of available translations
to assist the human translator. Although
detailed accounts of the matching algo-
rithms used in commercial systems can’t
be found in the literature, it is widely
believed that edit distance algorithms are
used. This paper investigates and eval-
uates the use of several matching algo-
rithms, including the edit distance algo-
rithm that is believed to be at the heart
of most modern commercial TM systems.
This paper presents results showing how
well various matching algorithms corre-
late with human judgments of helpfulness
(collected via crowdsourcing with Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk). A new algorithm
based on weighted n-gram precision that
can be adjusted for translator length pref-
erences consistently returns translations
judged to be most helpful by translators for
multiple domains and language pairs.
1 Introduction
The most widely used computer-assisted transla-
tion (CAT) tool for professional translation of spe-
cialized text is translation memory (TM) technol-
ogy (Christensen and Schjoldager, 2010). TM
consists of a database of previously translated ma-
terial, referred to as the TM vault or the TM bank
(TMB in the rest of this paper). When a trans-
lator is translating a new sentence, the TMB is
consulted to see if a similar sentence has already
been translated and if so, the most similar pre-
vious translation is retrieved from the bank to
help the translator. The main conceptions of TM
technology occurred in the late 1970s and early
1980s (Arthern, 1978; Kay, 1980; Melby and oth-
ers, 1981). TM has been widely used since the
late 1990s and continues to be widely used to-
day (Bowker and Barlow, 2008; Christensen and
Schjoldager, 2010; Garcia, 2007; Somers, 2003).
There are a lot of factors that determine how
helpful TM technology will be in practice. Some
of these include: quality of the interface, speed of
the back-end database lookups, speed of network
connectivity for distributed setups, and the com-
fort of the translator with using the technology.
A fundamentally important factor that determines
how helpful TM technology will be in practice is
how well the TM bank of previously translated
materials matches up with the workload materials
to be translated. It is necessary that there be a high
level of match for the TM technology to be most
helpful. However, having a high level of match is
not sufficient. One also needs a successful method
for retrieving the useful translations from the (po-
tentially large) TM bank.
TM similarity metrics are used for both evalu-
ating the expected helpfulness of previous transla-
tions for new workload translations and the met-
rics also directly determine what translations get
provided to the translator during translation of new
materials. Thus, the algorithms that compute the
TM similarity metrics are not only important, but
they are doubly important.
The retrieval algorithm used by commercial TM
systems is typically not disclosed (Koehn and
Senellart, 2010; Simard and Fujita, 2012; Why-
man and Somers, 1999). However, the best-
performing method used in current systems is
widely believed to be based on edit distance (Bald-
win and Tanaka, 2000; Simard and Fujita, 2012;
Whyman and Somers, 1999; Koehn and Senellart,
2010; Christensen and Schjoldager, 2010; Man-
dreoli et al., 2006; He et al., 2010). Recently
202
Simard and Fujita (2012) have experimented with
using MT (machine translation) evaluation metrics
as TM fuzzy match, or similarity, algorithms. A
limitation of the work of (Simard and Fujita, 2012)
was that the evaluation of the performance of the
TM similarity algorithms was also conducted us-
ing the same MT evaluation metrics. Simard
and Fujita (2012) concluded that their evalua-
tion of TM similarity functions was biased since
whichever MT evaluation metric was used as the
TM similarity function was also likely to obtain
the best score under that evaluation metric.
The current paper explores various TM fuzzy
match algorithms ranging from simple baselines
to the widely used edit distance to new methods.
The evaluations of the TM fuzzy match algorithms
use human judgments of helpfulness. An algo-
rithm based on weighted n-gram precision consis-
tently returns translations judged to be most help-
ful by translators for multiple domains and lan-
guage pairs. In addition to being able to retrieve
useful translations from the TM bank, the fuzzy
match scores ought to be indicative of how helpful
a translation can be expected to be. Many transla-
tors find it counter-productive to use TM when the
best-matching translation from the TM is not simi-
lar to the workload material to be translated. Thus,
many commercial TM products offer translators
the opportunity to set a fuzzy match score thresh-
old so that only translations with scores above the
threshold will ever be returned. It seems to be a
widely used practice to set the threshold at 70%
but again it remains something of a black-box as to
why 70% ought to be the setting. The current pa-
per uncovers what expectations of helpfulness can
be given for different threshold settings for various
fuzzy match algorithms.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 presents the TM similarity metrics that
will be explored; section 3 presents our experi-
mental setup; section 4 presents and analyzes re-
sults; and section 5 concludes.
2 Translation Memory Similarity
Metrics
In this section we define the methods for measur-
ing TM similarity for which experimental results
are reported in section 4. All of the metrics com-
pute scores between 0 and 1, with higher scores
indicating better matches. All of the metrics take
two inputs: M and C, where M is a workload sen-
tence from the MTBT (Material To Be Translated)
and C is the source language side of a candidate
pre-existing translation from the TM bank. The
metrics range from simple baselines to the sur-
mised current industrial standard to new methods.
2.1 Percent Match
Perhaps the simplest metric one could conceive of
being useful for TM similarity matching is percent
match (PM), the percent of tokens in the MTBT
segment found in the source language side of the
candidate translation pair from the TM bank.
Formally,
PM(M,C) =
|M
unigrams
?
C
unigrams
|
|M
unigrams
|
, (1)
where M is the sentence from the MTBT that is
to be translated, C is the source language side
of the candidate translation from the TM bank,
M
unigrams
is the set of unigrams in M , and
C
unigrams
is the set of unigrams in C.
2.2 Weighted Percent Match
A drawback of PM is that it weights the match-
ing of each unigram in an MTBT segment equally,
however, it is not the case that the value of assis-
tance to the translator is equal for each unigram
of the MTBT segment. The parts that are most
valuable to the translator are the parts that he/she
does not already know how to translate. Weighted
percent match (WPM) uses inverse document fre-
quency (IDF) as a proxy for trying to weight words
based on how much value their translations are ex-
pected to provide to translators. The use of IDF-
based weighting is motivated by the assumption
that common words that permeate throughout the
language will be easy for translators to translate
but words that occur in relatively rare situations
will be harder to translate and thus more valuable
to match in the TM bank. For our implementa-
tion of WPM, each source language sentence in
the parallel corpus we are experimenting with is
treated as a “document” when computing IDF.
Formally,
WPM(M,C) =
?
u?{M
unigrams
T
C
unigrams
}
idf(u,D)
?
u?M
unigrams
idf(u,D)
, (2)
where M , C, M
unigrams
, and C
unigrams
are as
defined in Eq. 1, D is the set of all source language
203
sentences in the parallel corpus, and idf(x,D) =
log(
|D|
|{d?D:x?d}|
).
2.3 Edit Distance
A drawback of both the PM and WPM metrics
are that they are only considering coverage of the
words from the workload sentence in the candi-
date sentence from the TM bank and not taking
into account the context of the words. However,
words can be translated very differently depending
on their context. Thus, a TM metric that matches
sentences on more than just (weighted) percentage
coverage of lexical items can be expected to per-
form better for TM bank evaluation and retrieval.
Indeed, as was discussed in section 1, it is widely
believed that most TM similarity metrics used in
existing systems are based on string edit distance.
Our implementation of edit distance (Leven-
shtein, 1966), computed on a word level, is sim-
ilar to the version defined in (Koehn and Senellart,
2010).
Formally, our TM metric based on Edit Dis-
tance (ED) is defined as
ED = max
(
1?
edit-dist(M,C)
|M
unigrams
|
, 0
)
, (3)
where M , C, and M
unigrams
are as defined in
Eq. 1, and edit-dist(M,C) is the number of word
deletions, insertions, and substitutions required to
transform M into C.
2.4 N-Gram Precision
Although ED takes context into account, it does
not emphasize local context in matching certain
high-value words and phrases as much as metrics
that capture n-gram precision between the MTBT
workload sentence and candidate source-side sen-
tences from the TMB. We note that n-gram preci-
sion forms a fundamental subcomputation in the
computation of the corpus-level MT evaluation
metric BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). How-
ever, although TM fuzzy matching metrics are re-
lated to automated MT evaluation metrics, there
are some important differences. Perhaps the most
important is that TM fuzzy matching has to be able
to operate at a sentence-to-sentence level whereas
automated MT evaluation metrics such as BLEU
score are intended to operate over a whole cor-
pus. Accordingly, we make modifications to how
we use n-gram precision for the purpose of TM
matching than how we use it when we compute
BLEU scores. The rest of this subsection and the
next two subsections describe the innovations we
make in adapting the notion of n-gram precision to
the TM matching task.
Our first metric along these lines, N-Gram Pre-
cision (NGP), is defined formally as follows:
NGP =
N
?
n=1
1
N
p
n
, (4)
where the value of N sets the upper bound on the
length of n-grams considered
1
, and
p
n
=
|M
n-grams
? C
n-grams
|
Z ? |M
n-grams
|+ (1? Z) ? |C
n-grams
|
, (5)
where M and C are as defined in Eq. 1, M
n-grams
is the set of n-grams in M , C
n-grams
is the set of
n-grams in C, and Z is a user-set parameter that
controls how the metric is normalized.
2
As seen by equation 4, we use an arithmetic
mean of precisions instead of the geometric mean
that BLEU score uses. An arithmetic mean is bet-
ter than a geometric mean for use in translation
memory metrics since translation memory metrics
are operating at a segment level and not at the
aggregate level of an entire test set. At the ex-
treme, the geometric mean will be zero if any of
the n-gram precisions p
n
are zero. Since large n-
gram matches are unlikely on a segment level, us-
ing a geometric mean can be a poor method to use
for matching on a segment level, as has been de-
scribed for the related task of MT evaluation (Dod-
dington, 2002; Lavie et al., 2004). Additionally,
for the related task of MT evaluation at a segment
level, Lavie et al. (2004) have found that using
an arithmetic mean correlates better with human
judgments than using a geometric mean.
Now we turn to discussing the parameter Z for
controlling how the metric is normalized. At one
extreme, setting Z=1 will correspond to having no
penalty on the length of the candidate retrieved
from the TMB and leads to getting longer trans-
lation matches retrieved. At the other extreme,
1
We used N = 4 in our experiments.
2
Note that the n in n-grams is intended to be substituted
with the corresponding integer. Accordingly, for p
1
, n = 1
and therefore M
n-grams
= M
1-grams
is the set of unigrams
in M and C
n-grams
= C
1-grams
is the set of unigrams in C;
for p
2
, n = 2 and therefore M
n-grams
= M
2-grams
is the
set of bigrams in M and C
n-grams
= C
2-grams
is the set of
bigrams in C; and so on.
204
setting Z=0 will correspond to a normalization
that penalizes relatively more for length of the
retrieved candidate and leads to shorter transla-
tion matches being retrieved. There is a preci-
sion/recall tradeoff in that one wants to retrieve
candidates from the TMB that have high recall
in the sense of matching what is in the MTBT
sentence yet one also wants the retrieved candi-
dates from the TMB to have high precision in the
sense of not having extraneous material not rele-
vant to helping with the translation of the MTBT
sentence. The optimal setting of Z may differ
for different scenarios based on factors like the
languages, the corpora, and translator preference.
We believe that for most TM applications there
will usually be an asymmetric valuation of pre-
cision/recall in that recall will be more important
since the value of getting a match will be more
than the cost of extra material up to a point. There-
fore, we believe a Z setting in between 0.5 and 1.0
will be an optimal default. We use Z=0.75 in all
of our experiments described in section 3 and re-
ported on in section 4 except for the experiments
explicitly showing the impact of changing the Z
parameter.
2.5 Weighted N-Gram Precision
Analogous to how we improved PM with WPM,
we seek to improve NGP in a similar fashion. As
can be seen from the numerator of Equation 5,
NGP is weighting the match of all n-grams as
uniformly important. However, it is not the case
that each n-gram is of equal value to the transla-
tor. Similar to WPM, we use IDF as the basis of
our proxy for weighting n-grams according to the
value their translations are expected to provide to
translators. Specifically, we define the weight of
an n-gram to be the sum of the IDF values for each
constituent unigram that comprises the n-gram.
Accordingly, we formally define method
Weighted N-Gram Precision (WNGP) as follows:
WNGP =
N
?
n=1
1
N
wp
n
, (6)
where N is as defined in Equation 4, and
wp
n
=
?
i?{M
n-grams
? C
n-grams
}
w(i)
Z
[
?
i?M
n-grams
w(i)
]
+ (1? Z)
[
?
i?C
n-grams
w(i)
]
,
(7)
where Z, M
n-grams
, and C
n-grams
are as defined
in Equation 5, and
w(i) =
?
1-gram?i
idf(1-gram,D), (8)
where i is an n-gram and idf(x,D) is as defined
above for Equation 2.
2.6 Modified Weighted N-gram Precision
Note that in Equation 6 each wp
n
contributes
equally to the average. Modified Weighted N-
Gram Precision (MWNGP) improves on WNGP
by weighting the contribution of each wp
n
so that
shorter n-grams contribute more than longer n-
grams. The intuition is that for TM settings, get-
ting more high-value shorter n-gram matches at
the expense of fewer longer n-gram matches will
be more helpful since translators will get relatively
more assistance from seeing new high-value vo-
cabulary. Since the translators already presumably
know the rules of the language in terms of how
to order words correctly, the loss of the longer n-
gram matches will be mitigated.
Formally we define MWNGP as follows:
MWNGP =
2
N
2
N
? 1
N
?
n=1
1
2
n
wp
n
, (9)
where N and wp
n
are as they were defined for
Equation 6.
3 Experimental Setup
We performed experiments on two corpora from
two different technical domains with two language
pairs, French-English and Chinese-English. Sub-
section 3.1 discusses the specifics of the corpora
and the processing we performed. Subsection 3.2
discusses the specifics of our human evaluations of
how helpful retrieved segments are for translation.
205
3.1 Corpora
For Chinese-English experiments, we used the
OpenOffice3 (OO3) parallel corpus (Tiedemann,
2009), which is OO3 computer office productiv-
ity software documentation. For French-English
experiments, we used the EMEA parallel cor-
pus (Tiedemann, 2009), which are medical docu-
ments from the European Medecines Agency. The
corpora were produced by a suite of automated
tools as described in (Tiedemann, 2009) and come
sentence-aligned.
The first step in our experiments was to pre-
process the corpora. For Chinese corpora we to-
kenize each sentence using the Stanford Chinese
Word Segmenter (Tseng et al., 2005) with the Chi-
nese Penn Treebank standard (Xia, 2000). For all
corpora we remove all segments that have fewer
than 5 tokens or more than 100 tokens. We call
the resulting set the valid segments. For the pur-
pose of computing match statistics, for French cor-
pora we remove all punctuation, numbers, and sci-
entific symbols; we case-normalize the text and
stem the corpus using the NLTK French snowball
stemmer. For the purpose of computing match
statistics, for Chinese corpora we remove all but
valid tokens. Valid tokens must include at least
one Chinese character. A Chinese character is de-
fined as a character in the Unicode range 0x4E00-
0x9FFF or 0x4000-0x4DFF or 0xF900-0xFAFF.
The rationale for removing these various tokens
from consideration for the purpose of comput-
ing match statistics is that translation of numbers
(when they’re written as Arabic numerals), punc-
tuation, etc. is the same across these languages
and therefore we don’t want them influencing the
match computations. But once a translation is se-
lected as being most helpful for translation, the
original version (that still contains all the numbers,
punctuation, case markings, etc.) is the version
that is brought back and displayed to the transla-
tor.
For the TM simulation experiments, we ran-
domly sampled 400 translations from the OO3
corpus and pretended that the Chinese sides of
those 400 translations constitute the workload
Chinese MTBT. From the rest of the corpus we
randomly sampled 10,000 translations and pre-
tended that that set of 10,000 translations consti-
tutes the Chinese-English TMB. We also did simi-
lar sampling from the EMEA corpus of a workload
French MTBT of size 300 and a French-English
TMB of size 10,000.
After the preprocessing and selection of the
TMB and MTBT, we found the best-matching
segment from the TMB for each MTBT seg-
ment according to each TM retrieval metric de-
fined in section 2.
3
The resulting sets of
(MTBT segment,best-matching TMB segment)
pairs formed the inputs on which we conducted
our evaluations of the performance of the various
TM retrieval metrics.
3.2 Human Evaluations
To conduct evaluations of how helpful the transla-
tions retrieved by the various TM retrieval metrics
would be for translating the MTBT segments, we
used Amazon Mechanical Turk, which has been
used productively in the past for related work in
the context of machine translation (Bloodgood and
Callison-Burch, 2010b; Bloodgood and Callison-
Burch, 2010a; Callison-Burch, 2009).
For each (MTBT segment,best-matching TMB
segment) pair generated as discussed in subsec-
tion 3.1, we collected judgments from Turkers
(i.e., the workers on MTurk) on how helpful
the TMB translation would be for translating the
MTBT segment on a 5-point scale. The 5-point
scale was as follows:
• 5 = Extremely helpful. The sample is so sim-
ilar that with trivial modifications I can do the
translation.
• 4 = Very helpful. The sample included a large
amount of useful words or phrases and/or
some extremely useful words or phrases that
overlapped with the MTBT.
• 3 = Helpful. The sample included some use-
ful words or phrases that made translating the
MTBT easier.
• 2 = Slightly helpful. The sample contained
only a small number of useful words or
phrases to help with translating the MTBT.
• 1 = Not helpful or detrimental. The sample
would not be helpful at all or it might even be
harmful for translating the MTBT.
After a worker rated a (MTBT segment,TMB
segment) pair the worker was then required to give
3
If more than one segment from the TMB was tied for
being the highest-scoring segment, the segment located first
in the TMB was considered to be the best-matching segment.

an explanation for their rating. These explanations
proved quite helpful as discussed in section 4. For
each (MTBT segment,TMB segment) pair, we col-
lected judgments from five different Turkers. For
each (MTBT segment,TMB segment) pair these
five judgments were then averaged to form a mean
opinion score (MOS) on the helpfulness of the re-
trieved TMB translation for translating the MTBT
segment. These MOS scores form the basis of our
evaluation of the performance of the different TM
retrieval metrics.
4 Results and Analysis
4.1 Main Results
Tables 1 and 2 show the percent of the time that
each pair of metrics agree on the choice of the
most helpful TM segment for the Chinese-English
OO3 data and the French-English EMEA data, re-
spectively. A main observation to be made is that
the choice of metric makes a big difference in
the choice of the most helpful TM segment. For
example, we can see that the surmised industrial
standard ED metric agrees with the new MWNGP
metric less than 40% of the time on both sets of
data (35.0% on Chinese-English OO3 and 39.3%
on French-English EMEA data).
Tables 3 and 4 show the number of times each
metric found the TM segment that the Turkers
judged to be the most helpful out of all the TM
segments retrieved by all of the different metrics.
From these tables one can see that the MWNGP

method consistently retrieves the best TM segment
more often than each of the other metrics. Scat-
terplots showing the exact performance on every
MTBT segment of the OO3 dataset for various
metrics are shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3. To con-
serve space, scatterplots are only shown for met-
rics PM (baseline metric), ED (strong surmised
industrial standard metric), and MWNGP (new
highest-performing metric). For each MTBT seg-
ment, there is a point in the scatterplot. The y-
coordinate is the value assigned by the TM metric
to the segment retrieved from the TM bank and
the x-coordinate is the MOS of the five Turkers
on how helpful the retrieved TM segment would
be for translating the MTBT segment. A point
is depicted as a dark blue diamond if none of
the other metrics retrieved a segment with higher
MOS judgment for that MTBT segment. A point
is depicted as a yellow circle if another metric re-
trieved a different segment from the TM bank for
that MTBT segment that had a higher MOS.
A main observation from Figure 1 is that PM is
failing as evidenced by the large number of points
in the upper left quadrant. For those points, the
metric value is high, indicating that the retrieved
segment ought to be helpful. However, the MOS
is low, indicating that the humans are judging it
to not be helpful. Figure 2 shows that the ED
207
metric does not suffer from this problem. How-
ever, Figure 2 shows that ED has another prob-
lem, which is a lot of yellow circles in the lower
left quadrant. Points in the lower left quadrant are
not necessarily indicative of a poorly performing
metric, depending on the degree of match of the
TMB with the MTBT workload. If there is noth-
ing available in the TMB that would help with
the MTBT, it is appropriate for the metric to as-
sign a low value and the humans to correspond-
ingly agree that the retrieved sentence is not help-
ful. However, the fact that so many of ED’s points
are yellow circles indicates that there were better
segments available in the TMB that ED was not
able to retrieve yet another metric was able to re-
trieve them. Observing the scatterplots for ED and
those for MWNGP one can see that both methods
have the vast majority of points concentrated in
the lower left and upper right quadrants, solving
the upper left quadrant problem of PM. However,
MWNGP has a relatively more densely populated
upper right quadrant populated with dark blue di-
amonds than ED does whereas ED has a more
densely populated lower left quadrant with yel-
low circles than MWNGP does. These results and
trends are consistent across the EMEA French-
English dataset so those scatterplots are omitted
to conserve space.
Examining outliers where MWNGP assigns a
high metric value yet the Turkers indicated that the
translation has low helpfulness such as the point
in Figure 3 at (1.6,0.70) is informative. Looking
only at the source side, it looks like the translation
retrieved from the TMB ought to be very help-
ful. The Turkers put in their explanation of their
scores that the reason they gave low helpfulness
is because the English translation was incorrect.
This highlights that a limitation of MWNGP, and
all other TM metrics we’re aware of, is that they
only consider the source side.
4.2 Adjusting for length preferences
As discussed in section 2, the Z parameter can be
used to control for length preferences. Table 5
shows how the average length, measured by num-
ber of tokens of the source side of the translation
pairs returned by MWNGP, changes as the Z pa-
rameter is changed.
Table 6 shows an example of how the opti-
mal translation pair returned by MWNGP changes
from Z=0.00 to Z=1.00. The example illustrates

Table 6: This table shows for an example MTBT workload sentence from the EMEA French-English data
how the optimal translation pair returned by MWNGP changes when going from Z = 0.00 to Z = 1.00.
We provide the English translation of the MTBT workload sentence for the convenience of the reader
since it was available from the EMEA parallel corpus. Note that in a real setting it would be the job of
the translator to produce the English translation of the MTBT-French sentence using the translation pairs
returned by MWNGP as help.

the impact of changing the Z value on the na-
ture of the translation matches that get returned
by MWNGP. As discussed in section 2, smaller
settings of Z are appropriate for preferences for
shorter matches that are more precise in the sense
that a larger percentage of their content will be
relevant. Larger settings of Z are appropriate for
preferences for longer matches that have higher re-
call in the sense that they will have more matches
with the content in the MTBT segment overall, al-
though at the possible expense of having more ir-
relevant content as well.
5 Conclusions
Translation memory is one of the most widely
used translation technologies. One of the most
important aspects of the technology is the system
for assessing candidate translations from the TM
bank for retrieval. Although detailed descriptions
of the apparatus used in commercial systems are
lacking, it is widely believed that they are based
on an edit distance approach. We have defined
and examined several TM retrieval approaches, in-
cluding a new method using modified weighted n-
gram precision that performs better than edit dis-
tance according to human translator judgments of
helpfulness. The MWNGP method is based on the
following premises: local context matching is de-
sired; weighting words and phrases by expected
helpfulness to translators is desired; and allowing
shorter n-gram precisions to contribute more to the
final score than longer n-gram precisions is de-
sired. An advantage of the method is that it can be
adjusted to suit translator length preferences of re-
turned matches. A limitation of MWNGP, and all
other TM metrics we are aware of, is that they only
consider the source language side. Examples from
our experiments reveal that this can lead to poor
retrievals. Therefore, future work is called for to
examine the extent to which the target language
sides of the translations in the TM bank influence
TM system performance and to investigate ways
to incorporate target language side information to
improve TM system performance.
