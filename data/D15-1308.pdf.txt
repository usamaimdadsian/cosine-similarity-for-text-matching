Abstract
We consider the task of automatically
identifying participants’ motivations in the
public health campaign Movember and in-
vestigate the impact of the different moti-
vations on the amount of campaign dona-
tions raised. Our classification scheme is
based on the Social Identity Model of Col-
lective Action (van Zomeren et al., 2008).
We find that automatic classification based
on Movember profiles is fairly accurate,
while automatic classification based on
tweets is challenging. Using our classifier,
we find a strong relation between types of
motivations and donations. Our study is a
first step towards scaling-up collective ac-
tion research methods.
1 Introduction
Social media is a valuable source for studying
health-related behaviors (De Choudhury, 2014).
For example, Twitter was used for disease surveil-
lance (Lamb et al., 2013; Aramaki et al., 2011),
and was studied for its role in disseminating med-
ical information (Desai et al., 2012) and organiz-
ing public health campaigns (Emery et al., 2014;
Wehner et al., 2014). Social media data pro-
vides many opportunities to study social phenom-
ena such as health campaigns, but statistics based
on aggregating across social media users only pro-
vide a big picture of the phenomenon. A deeper
analysis of such phenomena requires fine-grained
information about the involved users. Since such
information is often not readily available, numer-
ous studies have appeared on automatically infer-
ring user characteristics (Bamman et al., 2014;
Eisenstein et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2013).
In the context of health campaigns, social sci-
entists have been interested in the motivations of
the participants (Cugelman et al., 2011). Knowl-
edge about individual motivations helps to explain
the emergence and effectiveness of collective ac-
tion, such as volunteering (Bekkers and Wiepking,
2011) or mobilizing other people (van den Broek
et al., 2015). The Social Identity Model of Collec-
tive Action (SIMCA) (van Zomeren et al., 2008)
identifies three key motivations of participants: 1)
social identification with the campaign organiza-
tion and community, 2) a perception of injustice
about the cause, and 3) collective efficacy, the col-
lective belief that the campaign can make a differ-
ence. Taken together, these three motivations pre-
dict the chance that an individual will participate
in collective action, such as participation in an on-
line health campaign. Aggregating motivations to
group-level may explain the effectiveness of on-
line health campaigns. Social scientists, however,
have not used computational methods to measure
these motivations (Johnston et al., 2009), so that
their analyses are often confined to small datasets.
Our study is a first step towards scaling-up
collective action research methods. To do so,
we explore automatic classification of the motiva-
tion types according to the SIMCA model. We
analyze the global health campaign Movember
(movember.com), which aims to raise funds and
awareness of men-related health issues by engag-
ing online conversations. Movember’s fundrais-
ers ask their friends to sponsor their moustache
and their efforts in the month of November. The
funds are donated to research concerned with men-
related health issues, such as prostate cancer.
Movember participants provide their motiva-
tions in their Movember profile. For example, a
participant writing ‘In honor of my Grandfather’
could be considered having an injustice motiva-
tion, while ‘To lead the brave men of Team [...]
(and our exceptionally understanding significant
others) in epic moustachery.’ indicates a social
identification motivation. Because such explicit
motivation statements are not available for many
online health campaigns, we also explore motiva-
2570
tion classification based on the tweets of partici-
pants during the campaign instead.
Our paper makes the following contributions:
• We automatically classify the motivations of
Movember participants and explore the use of
free-text motivations provided in Movember
profiles and tweets posted by the participants
during the campaign (Section 3).
• We apply our classifier to all US and UK
Movember profiles and find that participants
with an injustice motivation raise signifi-
cantly more funds (Section 4).
2 Dataset
In this section we discuss the collection and the
annotation of the data.
2.1 Collection
We collect data from two different sources.
Movember Profiles We focus on participants
from the two countries with the highest number
of English speaking Movember participants: the
United States and the United Kingdom. From
Movember we obtained the identifiers of all par-
ticipants of these two countries and we crawled
all US and UK Movember profiles in May 2015.
We extracted information such as the name, mo-
tivation (free-text), amount raised and whether
the participant was part of a team. We collected
166,422 US and 138,546 UK profiles.
Twitter Data We link Movember participants to
Twitter accounts based on tweets with a link to a
Movember profile in 2013 and 2014 (e.g., ‘please
support my moustache [LINK]’). If the Leven-
shtein distance between the name of the author of
the tweet and the name in the Movember profile
was 1 or less, we considered it a match (in total:
5,519 users). Manual inspection of 100 matches
showed that this method was highly precise (100%
precision). However, some matches were missed
due to the low Levenshtein distance threshold. For
each Twitter user in our dataset, we collected the
last 3,600 tweets.
We kept all tweets written between October 18
and December 14 (2 weeks before and after the
campaign). For each user, we used tweets from ei-
ther 2013 or 2014, depending on whether the user
posted a tweet with a Movember link at least once
during the period, given preference to the year
2014.
2.2 Annotation
We annotated the campaign participants based on
their provided motivations in their ‘My motiva-
tion’ section of their Movember profiles. The
motivation categories in our codebook are based
on the Social Identity Model of Collective Action
(van Zomeren et al., 2008):
• Injustice: A shared emotion that includes
both affective (e.g, anger) and cognitive per-
ceptions (ideology) of an unfair situation (van
Zomeren et al., 2008). It covers the ideolog-
ical motivation to join a campaign, when po-
tential participants compare the cause and the
situation of patients with their personal val-
ues (Klandermans, 2004). For example, ‘my
dad’, ‘I had testicular cancer’ or ‘because
men’s health is important to me’.
• Social identity: A sense of belonging to-
gether that emerges out of common at-
tributes, experiences and external labels (van
Zomeren et al., 2008). Participants may have
social motivations to identify with the on-
line health campaign, while not being inter-
ested in the cause (Kristofferson et al., 2014).
This category includes psychological bene-
fits, such as reputation or fun, that the so-
cial interactions of a campaign provide. For
example, ‘my friends asked me again to join
them’, or ‘a great excuse to grow a stache’.
• Collective efficacy: The shared belief that
ones group is capable of resolving its
grievances through a campaign (Bandura,
2000; Klandermans, 2004; van Zomeren et
al., 2008), for example by stating ‘this cam-
paign can make a difference!’.
Multiple motivations may be assigned to a sin-
gle campaign participant. Exactly recurring mo-
tivation texts that occurred frequently (more than
50 times, based on data analysis), were most likely
prefilled texts. They were not annotated, because
it was unclear whether participants used these ‘de-
fault’ motivations on purpose. For example, the
most frequent motivation ‘my motivation is to use
the power of the moustache to have an everlast-
ing impact on the face of mens health’ appeared in
104k profiles. The interrater reliability calculated
using Cohen’s Kappa was found to be satisfactory
to good based on 200 double annotations: injus-
tice (0.71), social identity (0.67) and collective ef-
ficacy (0.47) (Landis and Koch, 1977).

3 Classification Experiments
In this section we present results on automat-
ically identifying the motivations of Movember
participants. Because participants may have mul-
tiple motivation types, we train binary classifica-
tion models for each motivation type separately.
We use logistic regression with L2 regularization,
implemented using the Scikit-learn toolkit (Pe-
dregosa et al., 2011). We report results on the
test set using precision, recall, F
1
score and the
Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. Note that a
majority class classifier achieves an AUC of 0.5.
Feature development and parameter tuning was
done based on cross-validation on the training set.
Based on the same set of Movember participants,
we explore the use of two different types of data:
the provided free-text motivations in Movember
profiles (Section 3.1) and tweets of the participants
(Section 3.2).
1
http://www.dongnguyen.nl/data.html: The
identifiers of the Movember and corresponding Twitter ac-
counts, the country, text provided in the Movember profiles,
and the annotations.
3.1 Free-text Movember Motivations
All text is lowercased and tokenized. We explore
the following features: 1) Token unigrams and bi-
grams (frequency values), 2) LDA with 20 topics
(Blei et al., 2003) trained on text from all US and
UK Movember profiles (with the topic proportions
as feature values), 3) Text length, and 4) Country
(US=1, UK=0) to control for prior motivation dis-
tributions in the two countries.
The token features already lead to a high per-
formance, and no notable increase in performance
is observed by adding the other features (Table 1).
The features with the highest weight are shown in
Table 4. The performance numbers are in line with
the obtained inter-annotator agreement. For exam-
ple, the performance is highest on the injustice cat-
egory, which also had the highest inter-annotator
agreement (and vice versa for collective efficacy).
The lengths of texts alone have predictive
power. The texts are short (on average 158.4
characters), but there are markable differences
between motivation types. Participants with an
injustice motivation write longer motivations: the
average length of their texts is 213.74 chars in
the training set, compared to 148.24 chars (social
identity) and 130.93 chars (collective efficacy).

3.2 Tweets
In this section, we present experiments on identi-
fying the motivations based on Twitter data.
Preprocessing Many of the tweets posted dur-
ing the time of the campaign are not about the
campaign itself. Based on manually selected char-
acter sequences
2
, we separate relevant from non-
relevant tweets. The tweets are tokenized using
the CMU POS tagger (Owoputi et al., 2013). The
average number of tweets per user during the stud-
ied period is 109.1 (median: 46.0) and the average
number of relevant tweets is 8.0 (median: 4.0).
Features We explore the same features as with
the free-text motivations and several new features:
• Unigram and bigram tokens: URLs and user
mentions are replaced by generic tokens. We
only keep tokens used by at least 10 Twitter
users and we use their normalized frequency.
• URLs: We extract tokens from URLs by
taking the hostname, and paths up to depth
2 (e.g., us.movember.com/team/12345 results
in us.movember.com, us.movember.com/team
and us.movember.com/team/12345).
• User mentions: The Twitter accounts that are
mentioned.
• Effort: Length (#characters), #tweets about
Movember, #tweets about Movember/#total
number of tweets.
• LDA with 20 topics (Blei et al., 2003). The
model is trained on 1.5M tweets from 2013
and 2014 about the Movember campaign.
• Country: US=1, UK=0.
• Behavior: Fraction of retweets, tweets that
contain a user mention, hashtag, URL, or are
a reply. Number of days with a tweet about
Movember. Fraction of tweets in each week.
Results The results are reported in Table 3.
The URLs and behavior features were excluded
from the run with the combined feature set, be-
cause their individual results suggest no predic-
tive power (possibly due to the small training set).
The results are fairly low and just above the 0.5
AUC value of a random classifier. To test whether
the best performing classifiers for each motivation
type (based on their AUC scores) are significantly
better than a random classifier, we use permuta-
tion tests. We permute the labels to break the link
with the features and calculate the AUC scores of
the classifiers by training and testing on 1000 of
such permutations. The best classifiers for the in-
justice and social identity motivation types are sig-
nificantly better than random (p <0.01), but the
performance of the collective efficacy classifier is
only slightly significant (p <0.05).
To understand the low performance numbers,
we took a closer look at the task and the data. First,
we aimed to get a sense of the difficulty of the task.
In a small experiment based on 100 Twitter users
from the test set, one of the authors read the tweets
and tried to identify the motivations. The results
were also low (injustice: 0.488, social identity:
0.548, and collective efficacy: 0.590), suggesting
that the task in itself is also difficult for humans.
The task is challenging because many users
only post a few tweets about the campaign. In
our data, 382 users have only one relevant tweet
and 1,271 users have 5 relevant tweets or less.
Furthermore, many of the tweets posted during
the campaign focus on the Movember community
(Bravo and Hoffman-Goetz, 2015; Dwi Prasetyo
et al., 2015), making it hard to distinguish be-
tween the different motivations. For example, in-
stagram.com is among the top three of hostnames
for all motivation types. Sometimes participants
2
‘movember’, ‘mobro’, ‘mosista’, ‘cancer’, ‘shave’, ‘do-
nat’, ‘tache’, ‘prostate’, ‘ mo ’, ‘testicular’, ‘ mental ’ ‘ men’s
health’
2573
do explicitely mention their motivation (e.g., ‘In
honour of my dad, [..], I’m growing a horrible
moustache for an incredible cause, #Movember.
Donate here: [LINK]’), but such instances are rare
and in general the motivations of participants are
much less visible through their tweets.
Social media plays a large role in mediating so-
cial relationships and users adapt their behavior
to the online communities they are participating
in (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2013; Nguyen
and Ros´e, 2011). This may explain why most
participants, regardless of their motivation, em-
phasize the Movember community and its prac-
tices (such as the growing of moustaches) in their
tweets. Various studies within the emerging field
of Computational Social Science (Lazer et al.,
2009) have found that Twitter tends to be a good
reflection of society (Lamb et al., 2013; O’Connor
et al., 2010). However, our results emphasize that
the nature of the used platform influences how hu-
mans behave, and that this should be taken into
account when interpreting the data. In the case of
Movember, Twitter data alone could give a mis-
leading view of the motivations of the campaign’s
participants.
4 Motivations and Campaign Behavior
In this section we present a linear regression anal-
ysis (n=90,484) of how motivations affect cam-
paign donations by applying our classifier to all
US and UK Movember profile texts. Participants
of the Movember campaign can be part of a team.
We therefore included actual team membership as
a control variable, as we expect that team mem-
bers increase fundraisers’ effort due to peer pres-
sure. In our analysis, we exclude all participants
that have predefined motivations (214,484 out of
the 304,968 profiles), because these may not re-
flect the actual motivation.
The social identity motivation is the most fre-
quent in both countries, but the countries differ in
their distributions regarding the injustice and col-
lective efficacy motivations (Table 5).
% Injustice % Identity % Efficacy
UK 31.0 49.7 46.1
US 37.6 50.3 32.1
Table 5: Motivation distribution based on auto-
matic annotation (n=90,484). Note that partici-
pants may have multiple motivations.
On average, US participants donate more than
UK participants (Table 6). US campaign partic-
ipants with an injustice motivation raise signifi-
cantly (coef = 91.525, p < 0.001) more money
than participants with a social identity (coef =
?5.479, p = not significant) or collective efficacy
motivation (coef = ?5.765, p < 0.1). Participants
that are part of a team raise significantly (coef =
75.849, p < 0.001) more money than participants
without a team. Similar results were obtained for
the UK. Furthermore, participants with a social
identity motivation are more often part of a team
(UK: 58% vs. 51% of the participants without
a social identity motivation, US: 80% vs. 76%).
The regression analysis reveals that being part of a
team has a stronger and more positive effect on the
amounts raised than the expression of identity as a
motivation in the Movember profiles. Our findings
are in line with recent Slacktivism research which
proposes that people that express social motiva-
tions are reluctant to give more than token support
due to a lack of interest in the campaigns cause
(van den Broek et al., 2015; Kristofferson et al.,
2014). Actual team membership, however, con-
tributes to the effectiveness of online fundraising.

5 Conclusion
We explored the task of automatically identifying
the motivations of Movember campaign’s partic-
ipants. A classifier based on Movember profile
texts performed better than a classifier based on
Twitter data, possibly due to the role of Twitter
in building social relationships. Based on US and
UK Movember data, we found a strong link be-
tween motivations and donations, and motivations
and team membership. Classification of motiva-
tions might help campaign organizers to improve
their communication strategies. Our study is lim-
ited to the Movember campaign. Future research
might diverge to other types of online collective
action, such as online petitions and open source
communities. We also plan to explore larger
datasets and features based on network structures.
