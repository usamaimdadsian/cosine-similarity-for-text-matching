Abstract
We study the topic dynamics of interac-
tions in political debates using the 2012
Republican presidential primary debates
as data. We show that the tendency of
candidates to shift topics changes over the
course of the election campaign, and that it
is correlated with their relative power. We
also show that our topic shift features help
predict candidates’ relative rankings.
1 Introduction
The field of computational social sciences has cre-
ated many interesting applications for natural lan-
guage processing in recent years. One of the areas
where NLP techniques have shown great promise
is in the analysis of political speech. For example,
researchers have applied NLP techniques to polit-
ical texts for a variety of tasks such as predicting
voting patterns (Thomas et al., 2006), identifying
markers of persuasion (Guerini et al., 2008), cap-
turing cues that signal charisma (Rosenberg and
Hirschberg, 2009), and detecting ideological po-
sitions (Sim et al., 2013). Our work also analyzes
political speech, more specifically, presidential de-
bates. The contribution of this paper is to show
that the topic shifting tendency of a presidential
candidate changes over the course of the election
campaign, and that it is correlated with his or her
relative power. We also show that this insight can
help computational systems that predict the candi-
dates’ relative rankings based on their interactions
in the debates.
2 Motivation
The motivation for this paper stems from prior
work done by the first author in collaboration
with other researchers (Prabhakaran et al., 2013a;
Prabhakaran et al., 2013b). Prabhakaran et al.
(2013a) introduced the notion of power in the do-
main of presidential debates, and Prabhakaran et
al. (2013b) followed it up with an automatic power
ranker system based on interactions within the de-
bates. The power that a candidate had at a cer-
tain point in the election campaign was modeled
based on his or her recent poll standings: in elec-
tions, popularity is power. Those studies analyzed
the 2012 Republican presidential primary debates
and found that a candidate’s power at the time of
a debate correlates with the structure of interac-
tions within the debate (e.g., turn frequency and
interruption patterns). Another finding was that
the candidates’ power correlates with the distribu-
tion of topics they speak about in the debates: can-
didates with more power spoke significantly more
about certain topics (e.g., economy) and less about
certain other topics (e.g., energy). However, these
findings relate to the specific election cycle that
was analyzed and will not carry over to political
debates in general.
A further dimension with relevance beyond a
specific election campaign is how topics evolve
during the course of an interaction (e.g., who at-
tempts to shift topics). In (Prabhakaran et al.,
2014), we explored this dimension and found that
candidates with higher power introduce signifi-
cantly more topics in the debates, but attempt to
shift topics significantly less often while respond-
ing to a moderator. We used the basic LDA topic
modeling method (with a filter for substantivity of
turns) to assign topics to turns, which were then
used to detect shifts in topics. However, segment-
ing interactions into coherent topic segments is an
active area of research and a variety of topic mod-
eling approaches have been proposed for that pur-
pose. In this paper, we explore the utility of one
such topic modeling approach to tackle this prob-
lem.
While most of the early approaches for topic
segmenting in interactions have focused on the
1481
content of the contribution, Nguyen et al. (2012)
introduced a system called Speaker Identity for
Topic Segmentation (SITS) which also takes into
account the topic shifting tendencies of the partic-
ipants of the conversation. In later work, Nguyen
et al. (2013) demonstrated the SITS system’s util-
ity in detecting influencers in Crossfire debates
and Wikipedia discussions. They also applied the
SITS system to the domain of political debates.
However they were able to perform only a qual-
itative analysis of its utility in the debates domain
since the debates data did not have influence an-
notations. In this paper, we use the SITS system
to assign topics to turns and perform a quantita-
tive analysis of how the topic shift features calcu-
lated using the SITS system relate to the notion of
power as captured by (Prabhakaran et al., 2013a).
The SITS system associates each debate partic-
ipant with a constant scalar value that captures his
or her tendency to shift topics. However, since
we want to investigate how each candidate’s topic
shifting tendency relates to his or her changing
power over the course of the campaign, we intro-
duce a variation of the SITS analysis in which we
represent a different “persona” for each candidate
in each debate. Once equipped with this notion
of “persona”, we find that the topic shifting ten-
dency of a candidate does indeed show a great deal
of fluctuation during the election campaign period.
We also find that this fluctuation in topic shifting
tendencies is significantly correlated with the can-
didates’ power.
As an additional contribution of this paper, we
demonstrate the utility of our topic shift features
extracted using both types of SITS-based anal-
yses in improving the performance of the auto-
matic power ranker system presented in (Prab-
hakaran et al., 2013b). We also investigated the
utility of topic shifting features described in (Prab-
hakaran et al., 2014) extracted using LDA based
topic modeling. However, they did not improve
the performance of the ranker, and hence we do
not discuss them in detail in this paper.
3 Data
We use the presidential debates corpus released by
Prabhakaran et al. (2013a), which contains manual
transcripts of 20 debates held between May 2011
and February 2012 as part of the 2012 Republican
presidential primaries. The corpus also captures
each candidate’s power at the time of each debate,
computed based on their relative standing in re-
cent public polls. The poll numbers capture how
successful candidates are in convincing the elec-
torate of their candidature, which in turn affects
their confidence within the debates. These debates
serve as a rich domain to explore manifestations
of power since they are a medium through which
candidates pursue and maintain power over other
candidates. Prabhakaran et al. (2013b) offers a de-
tailed description of how the relative standings in
national and state-level polls from various sources
are aggregated to obtain candidates’ power.
The transcripts are originally obtained from The
American Presidency Project, where each turn of
the conversation is manually demarcated and their
speakers identified. The turns in the corpus are
preprocessed using the Stanford CoreNLP pack-
age to perform basic NLP steps such as tokeniza-
tion, sentence segmentation, parts-of-speech tag-
ging and lemmatization.
4 Modeling Topic Shifts
Topic segmentation, the task of segmenting inter-
actions into coherent topic segments, is an impor-
tant step in analyzing interactions. In addition
to its primary purpose, topic segmentation also
identifies the speaker turn where the conversation
changed from one topic to another, i.e., where the
topic shifted, which may shed light on the char-
acteristics of the speaker who changed the topic.
We use the SITS approach proposed by (Nguyen
et al., 2012) to detect topic shifts. We also propose
a different way of using SITS to obtain an analysis
of our corpus, which we call SITS
var
. We discuss
both in turn, and then provide a discussion.
4.1 Segmentation using SITS
Most computational approaches towards auto-
matic topic segmentation have focused mainly on
the content of the contribution without taking into
account the social aspects or speaker character-
istics. Different discourse participants may have
different tendencies to introduce or shift topics in
interactions. In order to address this shortcom-
ing, Nguyen et al. (2012) proposed a new topic
segmentation model called Speaker Identity for
Topic Segmentation (SITS), in which they explic-
itly model the individual’s tendency to introduce
new topics.
Like traditional topic modeling approaches, the
SITS system also considers each turn to be a

bag of words generated from a mixture of top-
ics. These topics themselves are multinomial dis-
tributions over terms. In order to account for the
topic shifts that happen during the course of an in-
teraction, they introduce a binary latent variable
l
d;t
called the topic shift to indicate whether the
speaker changed the topic or not in conversation
d at turn t. To capture the individual speaker’s
topic shifting tendency, they introduced another
latent variable called topic shift tendency (pi
x
) of
speaker x. The pi
x
value represents the propensity
of speaker x to perform a topic shift.
4.2 Segmentation using SITS
var
Within the SITS formulation, the topic shifting
tendency of an individual (pi
x
) is considered a con-
stant across conversations. While an individual
may have an inherent propensity to shift topics or
not, we argue that the topic shifting tendency he
or she displays can vary based on the social set-
tings in which he or she interacts and his or her
status within those settings. In other words, the
same discourse participant may behave differently
in different social situations and at different points
in time. This is especially relevant in the context
of our dataset, where the debates happen over a
period of 10 months, and the power and status
of each candidate in the election campaign vary
greatly within that time period.
We propose a variant of SITS which takes this
issue into account. We consider each candi-
date to have a different “persona” in each debate.
To accomplish this, we create new identities for
each candidate x for each debate d, denoted by
x d. For example, ‘ROMNEY 08-11-2011’ de-
notes the persona of the candidate ROMNEY in
the debate held on 08-11-2011. Running the SITS
system using this formulation, we obtain different
pi
x d
values for candidate x for different debates,
capturing different topic shift tendencies of x.
4.3 Execution
We perform both the SITS and SITS
var
analyses
on the 20 debates in our corpus. We used the non-
parametric version of SITS for both runs, since it
systemically estimates the number of topics in the
data. We set the maximum number of iterations
at 5000, sample lag at 100 and initial number of
topics at 25. We refer the reader to (Nguyen et al.,
2013) for details on these parameters.
For each candidate, we calculate the mean and
standard deviation of the topic shift tendency
(pi
x d
) of his or her personas across all debates
he or she participated in. We then average these
means and standard deviations, and obtain an av-
erage mean of 0.14 and an average standard devia-
tion of 0.09. This shows that the topic shift tenden-
cies of candidates vary by a considerable amount
across debates. Figure 1 shows the pi
x d
value fluc-
tuating across different debates.
5 Analysis of Topic Shift Features
Nguyen et al. (2013) used the SITS analysis as a
means to model influence in multi party conver-
sations. They propose two features to detect in-
fluencers: Total Topic Shifts (TTS) and Weighted
Topic Shifts (WTS). TTS(x, d) captures the ex-
pected number of topic shifts the individual x
makes in conversation d. This expectation is cal-
culated through the empirical average of samples

Table 1: Pearson Correlations for Topical Features
boldface denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05)
from the Gibbs sampler, after a burn-in period. We
refer the reader to (Nguyen et al., 2013) for more
details on how this value is computed. WTS(x, d)
is the value of TTS(x, d) weighted by 1? pi
x
. The
intuition here is that a topic shift by a speaker with
low topic shift tendency must be weighted higher
than that by a speaker with a high topic shift ten-
dency. We use these two features as well, and de-
note the set of these two features as TopSh.
We also extract the TTS and WTS features us-
ing our SITS
var
variation of topic segmentation
analysis and denote them as TTS
var
and WTS
var
respectively. In addition, we also use a feature
PI
var
(x, d) which is the pi
x d
value obtained by the
SITS
var
for candidate x in debate d. It captures the
topic shifting tendency of candidate x in debate d.
(We do not include the SITS pi
x
value in our corre-
lation analysis since it is constant across debates.)
We denote the set of these three features obtained
from the SITS
var
run as TopSh
var
.
Table 1 shows the Pearson’s product correla-
tion between each topical feature and candidate’s
power. We obtain a highly significant (p = 0.002)
negative correlation between topic shift tendency
of a candidate (PI) and his/her power. In other
words, the variation in the topic shifting tenden-
cies is significantly correlated with the candidates’
recent poll standings. Candidates who are higher
up in the polls tend to stay on topic while the
candidates with less power attempt to shift top-
ics more often. This is in line with our previous
findings from (Prabhakaran et al., 2014) that can-
didates with higher power attempt to shift topics
less often than others when responding to moder-
ators. It is also in line with the findings by Prab-
hakaran et al. (2013a) that candidates with higher
power tend not to interrupt others. On the other
hand, we did not obtain any significant correlation
for the features proposed by Nguyen et al. (2013).
6 Topic Shift Features in Power Ranker
In this section, we investigate the utility of the
SITS and SITS
var
based topic shift features de-
scribed above in the problem of automatically
ranking the participants of debates based on their
power. Prabhakaran et al. (2013b) define the prob-
lem as follows: given a debate d with a set of par-
ticipants C
d
= {x
1
, x
2
, ...x
n
} and corresponding
power indices P (x
i
) for 1 < i < n, find a ranking
function r : C
d
? {1...n} such that for all 1 <
i, j < n, r(x
i
) > r(x
j
) ?? P (x
i
) > P (x
j
).
For our experiments, we use the SVM
rank
based
supervised learned power ranker presented in that
work to estimate this ranking function.
As we do in (Prabhakaran et al., 2013b), we
here report Kendall’s Tau and Normalized Dis-
counted Cumulative Gain values (NDCG and
NDCG@3) on 5-fold cross validation (at the de-
bate level). All three metrics are based on the
number of rank inversions between original and
predicted ranking. While Tau treats all rank in-
versions equal, NDCG and NDCG@3 penalize
the inversions happening in the top of the ranked
list more than those happening in the bottom.
NDCG@3 focuses only on the top 3 positions in
the ranked list.
We use the best performing feature set of (Prab-
hakaran et al., 2013b) as the baseline (BL), which
contains three features: Words Deviation (WD),
Question Deviation (QD) and Mention Percent-
age (MP). WD and QD capture the deviation of
percentage of words spoken by the candidate and
questions addressed to the candidate from the ex-
pected fair share of those measures in the particu-
lar debate. The fair share for debate d is 1/|C
d
|—
the percentage each candidate would have gotten
for each feature if it was equally distributed. This
deviation measure is used instead of the raw per-
1484

centage in order to handle the fact that the percent-
age values are dependent on the number of partic-
ipants in a debate, which varied from 9 to 4. MP
captures the percentage of mentions of the candi-
date within a debate.
Table 2 shows the results obtained using the
baseline features (BL) as well as combinations of
TopSh and TopSh
var
features. The baseline sys-
tem obtained a Kendall Tau of 0.55, NDCG of
0.962 and NDCG@3 of 0.932. The topic shift
features by themselves performed much worse,
with TopSh
var
posting marginally better results
than TopSh. Combining the topic shift and base-
line features increases performance considerably.
TopSh
var
obtained better performance than TopSh
across the board. BL + TopSh
var
posted the over-
all best system obtaining a Tau of 0.60, NDCG
of 0.970, and NDCG@3 of 0.937. These results
demonstrates the utility of topic shift features in
the power ranking problem, especially using the
SITS
var
formulation. We also experimented with
all subsets of TopSh and TopSh
var
; the best results
were obtained using all features in each set.
7 Related Work
Studies in sociolinguistics (e.g., (Ng et al., 1993;
Ng et al., 1995; Reid and Ng, 2000)) have long
established that dialog structure in interactions re-
lates to power and influence. Researchers in the
NLP community have studied power and influence
in various genres of interactions, such as organiza-
tional email threads (Bramsen et al., 2011; Gilbert,
2012; Prabhakaran and Rambow, 2013; Prab-
hakaran and Rambow, 2014), online discussion fo-
rums (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Bi-
ran et al., 2012) and online chat dialogs (Strza-
lkowski et al., 2012). The correlates analyzed in
these studies range from word and phrase patterns,
to derivatives of such patterns such as linguistic
coordination, to deeper dialogic features such as
argumentation and dialog acts. Our work differs
from these studies in that we study the correlates
of power in topic dynamics. Furthermore, we an-
alyze spoken interactions.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we studied how topic shift patterns
in the 2012 Republican presidential debates corre-
late with the power of candidates. We proposed an
alternate formulation of the SITS topic segmenta-
tion system that captures fluctuations in each can-
didate’s topic shifting tendencies, which we found
to be correlated with their power. We also showed
that features based on topic shift improve the pre-
diction of the relative rankings of candidates. In
future work, we will explore a model that cap-
tures individuals’ inherent topic shift propensities,
while also capturing their fluctuations due to so-
cial factors.
