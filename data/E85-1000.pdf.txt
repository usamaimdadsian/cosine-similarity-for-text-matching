PREFACE 
It was a great pleasure to be able to act as hosts for the Second Conference of the 
European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Most of the credit 
for the success of the conference must go to those who submitted papers. There were 
almost twice as many as we were able to accept, thus allowing us to arrange a programme 
which, in its variety and quality, reflected the wide-ranging interests of European scholars 
in the field, although drawing upon the international computational linguistic community 
for its composition. The success of this meeting, and of its predecessor in Pisa, confirms 
that the establishment of a European Chapter to act in concert with its American-based 
older brother was indeed worthwhile. The growing membership and the large attendance 
at the Conference show that the Chapter is serving one of its purposes in stimulating 
research in the area. 
Thanks are due to all those who contributed to the success of the meeting: to the 
members of the programme committee, whose job was by no means trivial, since each 
member took individual responsibility for a specific area of the programme; to the 
referees; and to all those who helped with the organisation. Special thanks should go to 
Mike Rosner and to Martine Vermeire, for all the energy and enthusiasm they put in to 
seeing that the practical arrangements went smoothly; to Kirsten Falkedal for her 
invaluable help in arranging the programme; and to Don Walker and Eva Hajicova for 
holding our hands when we needed them to. Finally, let me repeat that the most 
important support comes from the members of the association, whose enthusiasm has 
ensured that the European Chapter has grown from conception to a living and flourishing 
organisation i so short a time. May it continue to flourish.
