ABSTRACT 
The veto forms are o4ten claimeo to convey two 
;inds o+ information : 
I. w~et'~er the event Oeecr ibed in a sentence is 
present, past or future (= oe ic t i c  in fo rmat ion  
2. whether the event described in a sentence is 
oresente~ as completed, going on, just  s ta r t ing  
or being , in ished (= espectual information) 
\ [ t  w i l l  be ~emonstrated in th i s  paper that one 
has t l  ado a rhino component to  the analysis of 
verb ~orm meanings, namely w~e~ner or no~ they

The 4ramewor~ 04 the analysis is mo~el-

BACKGROUND 
The ana lw ls  of iteration and ha~ituality in 
th is  ~aper is part of a comprehensive semantic 
ar~Ivs is  of temporal expressions in natural 
kanguage. The research on th i s  topic is carr ied 
ob~ in ~he framework of EUROTRA, the MT project o4 
the European Community. It is reporteo on 
e, tensi~,eiv in Van Eynde (lqBT). 
The or ig ina l  motive for s~arting th is  research 
~as the fact that verbal tenses ann temporal 
a,:~:i l i~ries do not corresponO one-to-one in toe 
ienguages that EUROTRA has to deal with. Compare

A Format for Representation 
For the semantic analysis of the temporal 
expressions i w i l i  s ta r t  from tne assumption t~at 
every sentence can be analvseo in two parts : the 
temporal informal:on expressa~ by the tenses. 
aux i l i a r ies  anO ao~erbials on t~e one hano. anp 
~as~o atempora! proposit ion on the ot~er hand. 
(b; the cat sat on t~e mat 
w~.i. for instance, be analyseo in a basic 
proposit ion "the cat s i t  on the met" and the 
~n~ormation conveyed Dv the past tense. 
The re la t ion  between both is established in two 
steps : the basic proposit ion is f i r s t  relateO to 
the in terva l  ~or whicn i t  is said to be true,  the 
socalled time of event (E), and then th is  in terva l  
is re lated to the time Of speech ~S) : 
3 E : ,E ,S )  ~ AT(E,the cat s i t  on the mat)3 
This formula states that "the cat s i t  on the mat" 
i~ true at an in terva l  E which precedes the tlme 
of speech S. 
Following Reichenbach (1947) I w i l l  furthermore 
assume that the relat ion between the time of event 
and the time of speech is mediated by a th i ro  kind 
o~ in terva l ,  namely the time of reference (R), So, 
instead of the simple ReI(E,S) we w111 have a 
composite ReI~E,R) & RefeR,S). 
Ne.t to th l s  re la t iona l  information tn~ 
tempore: expreeslons can also give spec i f ic  
informatlon about the iocat lon or the length of 
the reie~ant in terva ls .  This is typ ica l ly  Oone by 
means o~ t:me aOverbiais, such as "next year",  " in 
the  spring':, " for  t~o years", " t i l l  Christmas", 
etc. T~is in~ormatlon w i l l  be represented bY means 
o~ one-place preOicates over in tervs l s  : Freo(E) 
and Pred~) ,  
~n exception ~s tc be ~ade here +or the time o, 
speec~. ~nose precise locat ion or length is never 
spec~fleo b,  i inQo~stic means, bu\[ rather bv 
pragmatic factors .  A possible way to reelect  tn~s- 
In the &oc~,allsm is to t res t  i t  as an unbouno 
var iab le .  
In sum, the general format for the 
representat lon of temporal information looks as 
fol lows : 
3 R,E \[Rei(R.S) ~ Pred~R; & ~eI(E,R) ~ Prep(E) 
AT(E,p)\] 
where p is a basic atemporal proposit ion 
An example ; 
~T we wi l l  v ie l t  Moscow next year 
3 P,E \[,~R,S~ & ne~t vear~R) ~ =~E,R) & 
A ~ E,we v i s i t  Moscowi\] 
271 
As i t  stanos th is  format is not adequate yet 
fo ~ the ~epresentatlon of sentences l i ke  
(8~ last year they played chess every week 
(e~ he was always late 
The basic propoe~tions "they play chess" and 
"he oe la te"  do not hold for one par t i cu la r  time 
of event E, but rather for a set of in terva ls  
wnicn are spread in time in some way speci f ieo by 
"every week" in (8) and "always" in (9). 
In the fo l lowing part I w i l l  introduce an 
exter.oeO formalism which can OeaI with these typos 
04 iteration. 
THE EXTENDED FORMALISM 
Cycl ic Iteration 
Cyclic i te ra t ion  is marked by aoverpials  l i ke  
"ca i iv" ,  "every Monday", "each year" ,  etc. In 
~virk e.a. (1972) they are cal lao per iodic  
frequency adverbials. 
For the analysis of these adverbials I f i r s t  
IntroOuce the notion Crams time. The frame time ie 
the in terva l  which contains a l l  the instances of 
the event describeo in the basic propos i t ion.  In 
(8~ last  year they played chess every week 
t~e ~rame time is last  year. In the general forma~ 
t .e frame time occupies the same place as the time 
c~ event in non- i te ra t ive  in terpretat ions  (= the 
E - i~terva i~,  
~ext, I de~ine a set of d i s t inc t ,  non- 
overlapping subinterva ls  ~I~ which are a l l  part o+ 
the frame time. In (8~, these in terva ls  have a 
length of one week each. This gives the fo l lowing 
,pre l iminary)  representat ion :
5 R,E \[ (R,S) & last  year(R~ & =(E,R) & 
I \ [ c ' i ,E )  & nI :~ & week,i) - - -x  
AT~i,they play chess; \ ] \ ]  
R S 
s imi lar  analysis can be found in Stump (198i 
where t~e aoverbial frequency ad~ectlvee (P) ere 
given the fo l lowing t ru th  condit ion : 
F~' is true in a world w at an interval I 
i~4 ,~m is true in w at non-over lapp ing 
subintervals  o$ i distriOuteO throughout i 
~t perioOs of a speci$ieo length I .  " 
\[Stump 1981, 226\] 
5t~mp s i - interval cor responds  to my frame 
time. and his non-over lapp lng sub interva ls  
correspond to my I - in terva ls .  
As a representat ion of (B) th i s  formula is not 
su f f i c ient ,  though, since the instances of chess 
pla~ing do not have to take a whole week for  (B~ 
to. be true.  A more adequate paraphrase is to say 
that every week contained at least one subinterval  
(e~ during which they played chess : 
, , o  
l \ [ c ( l ,E~ & nl=~ & week!i) - - -> 
e \ [c~e, l )  & AT(e, they play cness)\] \ ]  
An argument in favor of th i s  refinement is that 
languages have special means for speci fy ing the e- 
times. In 
~I(' last year she arr ived at ~ c clock every da~ 
the aoverbia2 "at eight o ¢ioc~" denotes the 
locat lOn 04 t~e e- intervai  ; 
B 
Not ice tha~ the pro~art lee of e are constant 
within 'the 4tame time : the aoverDial "st eight 
o c lo t ! "  spec i t ies  t~e time of each o¢ her 
arr lvals  cf last year. 
The general format for the representat ion of 
cycl ic i terat ion is, hence~ 
3 R,E \[ReI~R,S) & PreO~R~ & Rei(E,Ri & Pred~E} & 
I \ [c( l .E~ & ni=O & P(1) - - - .  
e ~:~e~I~ ~ M(e) - - -2  AT~e,p; \ ] \ ] \ ]  
where P is replacec ov the head o4 a per iooic  
~requencv aoverbial ,  spec i fy ing the 
l ocat ion  or the  iengtn o~ I 
Io -opt lona}l~i  replaced ov ~ ti~,a 
advero~6i, sPecifYin~ the length cr the 
igcatlon C.f e 
~n im\ [ ,o r ta r~t  property of th i s  format is it ~. 
cha in - l i ke  s t ructure  : 
272 
R is oef~neo with respect to S : ReI~R,S~ 
E as defined with respect to R : ReI(E,R~ 
I is defineo w~th respect to E : ~( I ,E)  
and e is oefineo with respect to I : c(e. I~ 
As it stands, the format does not provioe any 
means for stat ing a d i rect  re la t ionsh ip  between 
the in terva ls  inside the frame time ~I and e~ ano 
the in terva ls  outside the frame time (S anO R~. As 
consequence, the formal~sm predicts  that 
temporal adverbials w~ich are in the scope o~ a 
frequency adverbial (:  the e-speci f iers~ cannot 
refer ba~K to the speech t~me or the eeference 
time: * Rei(e,S) and * Rel(e,R~, 
gooo p;ece of evidence for th is  hypothesis ~s 
pr~ioed  by the WHEN-aoveroiais. In general one 
can d is t inguish two kinde of those adverbials : 
t~e re la t iona l  ones, which express a re la t ion  
Oetween the reference time and the speech time, 
such as "~esterday" a'nd "tomorrow", and the non- 
re la t iona l  ones, which ident i fy  the locat ion o~ an 
:nterva l  without any reference to the speech t~me, 
suc~ as "between 8 and 9" and "at two o c lock".  
The in terest ing  thing now is t~at only the 
la t te r  adverbials can occur in the scope of a 
frequency adverbia l .  Compare 
:iI~ she arr ived every day between 8 anq 9 
e 
*(12~ she arr ived every day yesterday 
e 
The fact that the re la t iona l  WHEN-adverbials 
cannot occur in the scope of a frequency aoverb~al 
prcviOes some pos i t ive  evioence ~or not inciuoln§ 
d i rect  re la t ions  between e ano S in the formal~em. 
The cha ln - l i ke  structure of the representat ion 
format Is ,  hence, i~ngu is t i ca l ly  motivated. 
Temporal Quantifiers 
The format Oeveloped for the analysis of cvc l ic  
i te ra t lon  can also be useo for the analysis o~ the 
temporal ~uantifier$, such as "miway~", 
"scmetlmes", "never",  "seldom" ano "o f ten" .  The 
~rmet ion  they proviOe is less spec i f i c  than the 
ona p~ovioed by the period frequency aOverb~ais, 
ar, d t~s  should be ref iecteO in the i r  
representat ion.  
As a s tar t ing  point I take the general ~ormat 
~or the representation o~ sentences w~th a 
periodic frequency adverbial : 
. . .  ~ i \[c( l .E~ & nI=~ & P( l i  - - -> 
3 e \ [c ie , l i  &Mie) & AT(e,p) \ ] \ ]  
For a semantlc analysis of the temporal 
quant i f le rs  th i s  format has to be generalieeo. 
The most important change is the replacement of 
the universal ouant i ; ie r  bv a var iable : 
... Q I C=(I,E) . . .  
where Q can be any of the fo l lo~ing  quant i f le rs

Many o~ten, f requent ly

This analysis account~ for the anomaly of 
sentences l i ke

These sentences are eemant lce i iy  anomalous

The ne, t question is whethe," thP temporal 
quant!~iers introduce any ext ra -conq i t ions  on 
those In terva ls ,  ouch ms c~l ,E) ,  ~I=~ and P~i~. 
The f~rst  of t~ese condit ions appears to Pe 
relevant : the temporal quant i f ie rs  are ~ndeeo 
interpreteO wi~ respect to some given frame time. 
In

but onl~ a l l  possibie in terva ls  ~n the past. 
The conoit~on that the subintervals  may no~ 
overlap does not seem to be re levant ,  though, in 
(16, quaOratlc equations are aIweye s~mple 
273 
the Instances for whlon "quadratic equations Pe

objects ~re not necessari ly in terva ls ,  but rather 
cases or occasions wnlcn can but need no: be given 
m temporal in terpretat ion  (of.  Lewis 1975i. 
The th i rd  conOition concerns the propert ies of 
t~e I -ob jec ts .  In the case of the per iodic 
• ,equency aOverblals the relevant propert ies  
concern the locat ion or the length of the 
in terva l .  In the case of the temporal guant i f le rs  
one could think of speci fy ing a relevance 
conoiticn~ for a sentence l i ke  
~ he was always late 
ones not mea= that he was late at any possible 
occasion in the past, Put rather that he was late 
on al l  occasions on which his being late or timel~ 
could nave mattered. 
in Aqv~st, Hoepelman & Rohrer (1980) one can 
~ind a proposal to incorporate th is  information in 
the semantic representat ion,  but I w i l l  not adopt 
t~is  proposal here, since the condit ions o~ the 
,non)relevance of the occas ions are typica l iv  
determined O~ pragmatic factors ,  in 
~:" he always leaves o~-~ twelve

As a resu l t  of the foregoing reductions ar~o 
changes the general format for analysing tempo, al 
cuant i f ie rs  looks as fo l lows :

introGuce a special quant i f ie r  for marking

274 
The general format for the representation of 
habitual ~nterpretat~one Is,  hence, 
3 R,E \[ReI(R,S) ~ Pred(R) & Rel~E.R> ~ Preo(E) 
Most i \[c~I,E) ---> 
3 e \[c~e,I) ~ Pred(e) & AT~e,p)\]\]\] 
The Assignment of Representations to Sentences 
On t~e basis of the given analyses one 
O:stinguls~ three kinds of sentence meanings : 
no i terat ion 
no ~ i \[ l /per iod ic  
cyclic 
i~eration \ 
Q I \[ \] \ indef i - , te  
can 
is specified 
F is not specified 
Q is any of {~,3, 
"3,~ost,Manv,Few} 
The assl~nment of these meanings to particuiar 
sentences is fa i r l y  straightforward when the 
sentence contains a frequency adverOial or a 
temporal quanti f ier ,  but i f  there is none o~ 
those~ then the sentence is amOiguous Oetween a 
non-lterative and an habitual interpretation ~cf. 
the two interpretations of "he leaves at tweive"~. 
It, practice there are some oisambiguatlng 
~. I* the basic proposition (p) denotes a state, 
~r. er, the sentence can not have an habitual 
ir~erpreta~ior~ Compare 
:i;~ ne leaves at twelve 
,21 ne is in je i !  
~1~ can be interpreted as meaning that he has 
the naPlt of leaving at twelve, bu~ (21i cannot Oe 
interpreted ms meaning that he has the habit of 
bel=g in jail. 
~, Certain verb forms can biock the Oerivation o~ 
one of t~s two possiole interpretations. Compare 
~2~ he is drinking coffee 
12\]) he drinks coffee 
(22, can Oenote a single instance of drinking as 
wei" as a recent habit of him to drink:: coffee ~cf. 
in the sense of "he is. drinklng coffee nowadays"). 
(2; , ,  on the other hand, can only denote a habit; 
i t  cmnnot be used to report on a single instance 
o~ drinking. 
This demonstrates the need to distingulsn 
oi4ferent types of verb forms : the ones that wi l l  
aiways e l i c i t  an habitual interpretat ion,  the ones 
that block the derivation o~ an habitual 
interpretat ion,  and the ones that admit both kinds 
of interpretmtions. The firs~ are unequivocall~ 
\[+habitual\],  the second C-habitual\[ and the last 
wi l l  be given the feature \ [+/-habitual \ ] .  
THE INTERLINSUAL ANALYSIS OF THE VERB FORMS 
The Meanings of the Verb Forme 
In the previous parts i have presente¢ a 
formaliem for the representation of temporal 
information in sentences. This formallsm is 
especially deeigned for the anaiyeis of natural 
language, but not for the analysis o~ any 
particular natural language, such ae English, 
Dutch or Kiswahili. 
I ts  mmin purpose is to provide a conceptuall~ 
well-defined language for de;ining and comparln~ 
the ~eanings of te~poral expressions in di f ferent 
natural l~nguagee. In order to serve this purpose 
i t  is not s~ff ic lent ~o have a formalism, ~nouon. 
What is also needed is a general specif ication o4 
now the semmntic representations relate to tnelr 
imnguage specific co~nterpmrts, i .e .  the tenses, 
the temporal aux l i : r ies  and t~e time aoveroials. 
The ÷orme~ two wi i l  furcner de caileO veto forms, 
For c { ' is~ ~n~, those verb forms are summec up in 
the followlng rL~ie : 
Vero form ---~. \[+/-F'ast\] (wi11+ir.f) 
(have+EP) ({be+iNS to+fri l l )  
~e going 
T, hi_'¢ rule ylelds 24 (=2x2x2x3) 'verb forms. 
Their role in the semantic interpretation of 
sentences .:an easily de expressed in terms of the 
given formalism. They specify 
i .  the relat ion Petween reference time anO speech 
time : ~eI(R,S) (= oeict ic information) 
2. the relation between event time and reference 
time : ReI,E,R) (= aspectual information~ 
5. whether the sentence has an habitual and!or ; 
non-iterative ~nterpretaZlon 
275 
The meaning of a verb form can, hence, be 
representeO as a t r ip le  ~x,y,z> where x and v are 
substi~uteO for one of the possible dinar, 
-elations oe~ween interva ls ,  and where z is one of 
the three poesible habituali~y values. 
The aame verb  ~orm can,  of  course ,  have 
oifferent meanings and will, hence, Oe assoclateO 
~th  a set of such t r ip les .  
The detai ls o~ this association have  been 
discL:ssed elsewhere~ at \]east for the x ann ¥ 
values ~cf. Van Eynde, des Tombe & Maes 1985i. In 
tnls paper I wi l l  only discuss the z values in 
some deta i l .  
The Mabituality Value 
A good start ing point for demonstrating the 
relevance of the hab i tua l i ty  value is provided by 
the following i i s t  of sentences. They are taken 
from hess (1985). 
~)  a text editor makes modifications to a text 
f i l e  
~25) a text editor is makin~ modifications to a 
text f i l e  
~26) a text editor made mooiflcatione to a text 
f i l e  
• 27~ a text editor has made modifications to a 
text f i l e  
In L24) i t  is said "that a text editor ma~es 
modifications to a text f i l e  in general, almost by 
Oef in i t ion.  We might read this  sentence in a 
re~erence manual" (Hess 1985, 10). 
In (25-27), on the other hand, i t  is said "that 
there i s ,  or was, a case of a text editor mankind 
modifications to a text f i l e .  These remarks might 
~e made by a system operator, watcnlng ~is screen' 
(lb.). 
Hess concludes from these observations that the 
quant i f ier  of the subject is universal in (24) and 
e~:isten~ial in (25-27), However~ th is  conclusion 
does not foliow automatically. In terms of the 
formalism presented in this  paper one could sa~ 
that (24) has an habitual in terpretat ion ,  whereas 
the other sentences have a non- i terat ive 
interpretat ion,  In the former case the ex is tent ia l  
quant i f ier  of the subject wi l l  be in the scope o~ 
the Most-quantif ier,  whereas in the la t te r  case i t  
wl i i  not be in the scope of any non-existential  
quant i f ie r ,  and this accounts for the difference 
in interpretat ion without havinq to postulate two 
possiole meanings for the indef in i te  a r t i c le .  
Hess s examples are useful in this  context, 
t~ough, because they clear ly i l l us t ra te  the roie 
of the vend for~ in the interpretat ion.  Since i t  
is the only variable part in the sentences, the 
~ifferences in interpretat ion can only be ascribeo 
to them, more spec i f i ca l ly  to their hab l tua i i ty  
value. 
;or the assignment of an hab l tua l i ty  value to a 
given verb form one has to test whether i t  can or 
cannot e l i c i t  an habitual interpretat ion in some 
given context. In testing this  one should 
i. always use sentences with a non-stative basic 
proposit ion, for i~ the la t te r  is stat ive the 
sentence can never be habitual (of. supra) ; 
2. pay attention to the other inter i lngual  values 
of the verb form. The English simple present. 
for instance, is uneouivocally \[+habitual\]  in 
i t s  sim~Itaneoue meaning, but in i t s  posterior 
meaning i t  can be \ [ -nao i tua l \ ]  too (of. the 
non- i terat ive interpretat ion of "he leaves at 
twelve"~. 
The relevance of the \ [+/ -Hab i tua l i tv \ ] -  
d is t inct ion  has so far only been demonstrated from 
a monolln~ual semantic point of view. I t  is ,  
however, possible to give some translat ional  
evidence for this o let inct lo= as well. 
The relevant cas~s are tne ones where the 
corresponding verb forms have  Oi~ferent 
hab i :~a l l ty  values. A good example of th is  is the 
translat ion of the Dutch simple present in 
En~ilsh. 
The Dutch simple present can be both habitua} 
and ~on-hacitual in It~ simultaneous meaning : 
28; hi~ o,'inxt aileen whisky <simui,y,~haOitual~ 
"he drinks only whisky' 
29, Liji~, h i j  dr!nit k~4 ie  . ,s imul, / , -habltuai> 
"look, he Orinks co,fee" 
The English simple present, on the other hand, 
s always habitual in i t s  simultaneous meaning 
unless in sentences Oee:ribing states, of course 
(~0~ he only drinks whisky <slmui,y,+habitua~. 
*~31) iooi:, he drinks ~o~fee <s imul ,y , -ha~i tua l  
Pot the expression of slmul~aneous non- 
i te ra t iv i ty  one has to use She progressive : 
32) look, De is crinking coffee 
As a conseoue~ce. ~e mapping of (29) to ~32) 
in~ol~es a non-~riviai  tense replacement, and i t  
i l  o~e of the merits o~ the given formaliem that 
i t  car handle this i r  an lnter i ingual  way.
