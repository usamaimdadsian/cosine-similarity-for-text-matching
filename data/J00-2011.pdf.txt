In 1993, Eugene Charniak published aslim volume entitled Statistical Language Learning. 
At the time, empirical techniques for natural anguage processing were on the rise; 
that year, Computational Linguistics published a special issue on such methods, and 
Charniak's text was the first to treat the emerging field. 
Nowadays, the revolution has become the establishment; in 1998, nearly half the 
papers in Computational Linguistics concerned empirical methods (Hirschberg 1998). 
Indeed, Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schtitze's new, by-no-means slim textbook 
on statistical NLP--strangely, the first since Charniak'sl--begins "The need for a thor- 
ough textbook for Statistical Natural Language Processing hardly needs to be argued 
for." Indubitably so; the question is, is this it? 
Foundations ofStatistical Natural Language Processing (henceforth FSNLP) is certainly 
ambitious in scope. True to its name, it contains a great deal of preparatory material, 
including: gentle introductions to probability and information theory; a chapter on 
linguistic concepts; and (a most welcome addition) discussion of the nitty-gritty of 
doing empirical work, ranging from lists of available corpora to in-depth discussion 
of the critical issue of smoothing. Scattered throughout are also topics fundamental to
doing good experimental work in general, such as hypothesis testing, cross-validation, 
and baselines. Along with these preliminaries, FSNLP covers traditional tools of the 
trade: Markov models, probabilistic grammars, supervised and unsupervised classi- 
fication, and the vector-space model. Finally, several chapters are devoted to specific 
problems, among them lexicon acquisition, word sense disambiguation, parsing, ma- 
chine translation, and information retrieval. 2 (The companion website contains further 
useful material, including links to programs and a list of errata.) 
In short, this is a Big Book 3, and this fact alone confers some benefits. For the 
researcher, FSNLP offers the convenience of one-stop shopping: at present, there is 
no other NLP reference in which standard empirical techniques, tatistical tables, def- 
initions of linguistic terms, and elements of information retrieval appear together; 
furthermore, the text also summarizes and critiques many individual research pa- 
pers. Similarly, someone teaching a course on statistical NLP will appreciate the large 
number of topics FSNLP covers, allowing the tailoring of a syllabus to individual in- 
1 In the interim, the second edition of Allen's book (Allen 1995) did include some material on 
probabilistic methods, and much of Jelinek's Statistical Methods for Speech Recognition (Jelinek 1997) 
concerns language processing. Also, Speech and Language Processing (Jurafsky and Martin 2000), still 
forthcoming at the writing of this review, promises to cover many empirical methods. 
2 The grouping of topics in this paragraph, while convenient, does not correspond to the order of 
presentation i  the book. Indeed, the way in which one thinks about a subject need not be the 
organization that is best for teaching it, a point to which we will return later.

terests. And for those entering the field, the book records "folklore" knowledge that 
is typically acquired only by word of mouth or bitter experience, such as techniques 
for coping with computational underflow. The abundance of numerical examples and 
pointers to related references will also be of use. 
Of course, encyclopedias cover many subjects, too; a good text not only contains 
information, but arranges it in an edifying way. In organizing the book, the authors 
have "decided against attempting to present Statistical NLP as homogeneous in terms 
of mathematical tools and theories" (p. xxx), asserting that a unified theory, though 
desirable, does not currently exist. As a result, instead of the ternary structure im- 
plied by the third paragraph above--background, theory, applications--fundamentals 
appear on a need-to-know basis. For example, the key concept of separating training 
and test data (failure to do so being regarded in the community as a "cardinal sin" 
\[p. 206\]) appears as a subsection of the chapter on n-gram language modeling. It is 
therefore imperative that the "road map" section (p. xxxv) be read carefully. 
This design decision enables the authors to place attractive yet accessible topics 
early in the book. For instance, word sense disambiguation, a problem students eem 
to find quite intuitive, is presented a full two chapters before hidden Markov models, 
even though HMM's are considered a basic technology in statistical NLP. Two benefits 
accrue to those who are developing courses: students not only receive a more gen- 
tle (and, arguably, appetizing) introduction to the field, but can start course projects 
earlier, which instructors will recognize as a nontrivial point. 
However, the lack of an underlying set of principles driving the presentation has 
the unfortunate consequence of obscuring some important connections. For example, 
classification is not treated in a unified way: Chapter 7 introduces two supervised 
classification algorithms, but several popular and important echniques, including de- 
cision trees and k-nearest-neighbor, are deferred until Chapter 16. Although both chap- 
ters include cross-references, the text's organization blocks detailed analysis of these 
algorithms as a whole; for instance, the results of Mooney's (1996) comparison experi- 
ments simply cannot be discussed. Clustering (unsupervised classification) undergoes 
the same disjointed treatment, appearing both in Chapter 7 and 14. 
On a related note, the level of mathematical detail fluctuates in certain places. 
In general, the book tends to present helpful calculations; however, some derivations 
that would provide crucial motivation and clarification have been omitted. A salient 
example is (the several versions of) the EM algorithm, a general technique for param- 
eter estimation that manifests itself, in different guises, in many areas of statistical 
NLP. The book's suppression of computational steps in its presentations, combined 
with some unfortunate typographical errors, risks leaving the reader with neither the 
ability nor the confidence to develop EM formulations in his or her own work. 
Finally, if FSNLP had been organized around a set of theories, it could have been 
more focused. In part, this is because it could have been more selective in its choice of 
research paper summaries. Of the many recent publications covered, some are surely, 
sadly, not destined to make a substantive impact on the field. The book also occasion- 
ally exhibits excessive reluctance to extract principles. One example of this reticence 
is its treatment of the work of Chelba and Jelinek (1998); although the text hails this 
paper as "the first clear demonstration of a probabilistic parser outperforming a tri- 
gram model" (p. 457), it does not discuss what features of the algorithm lead to its 
superior esults. 
Implicit in all of these comments is the belief that a mathematical foundation 
for statistical natural anguage processing can exist and will eventually develop. The 
authors, as cited above, maintain that this is not currently the case, and they might well 
be right. But in considering the contents of FSNLP, one senses that perhaps already

there is a thinner book, similar to the current volume but with the background-theory- 
applications tructure mentioned above, struggling to get out. 
I cannot help but remember, in concluding, that I once read a review that said 
something like the following: "I know you're going to see this movie. It doesn't matter 
what my review says. I could write my hair is on fire and you wouldn't  notice because 
you're already out buying tickets." It seems likely that the same situation exists now; 
there is, currently, no other comprehensive r ference for statistical NLP. Luckily, this 
big book takes its responsibilities seriously, and the authors are to be commended for 
their efforts. 
But it is worthwhile to remember that there are uses for both Big Books and Little 
Books. One of my colleagues, a computational chemist with a background in statistical 
physics, recently became interested in applying methods from statistical NLP to protein 
modeling.* In particular, we briefly discussed the notion of using probabilistic ontext- 
free grammars for modeling long-distance dependencies. Intrigued, he asked for a 
reference; he wanted a source that would compactly introduce fundamental principles 
that he could adapt to his application. I gave him Charniak (1993).

seriously problems over an alphabet of four symbols" (p. 340) is akin to snubbing computer science 
because it only deals with zeros and ones.
