Abstract 
We investigate linguistic features that correlate 
with the readability of texts for adults with in-
tellectual disabilities (ID).  Based on a corpus 
of texts (including some experimentally meas-
ured for comprehension by adults with ID), we 
analyze the significance of novel discourse-
level features related to the cognitive factors 
underlying our users’ literacy challenges.  We 
develop and evaluate a tool for automatically 
rating the readability of texts for these users.  
Our experiments show that our discourse-
level, cognitively-motivated features improve 
automatic readability assessment. 
1 Introduction 
Assessing the degree of readability of a text has 
been a field of research as early as the 1920's. 
Dale and Chall define readability as “the sum 
total (including all the interactions) of all those 
elements within a given piece of printed material 
that affect the success a group of readers have 
with it. The success is the extent to which they 
understand it, read it at optimal speed, and find it 
interesting” (Dale and Chall, 1949). It has long 
been acknowledged that readability is a function 
of text characteristics, but also of the readers 
themselves.  The literacy skills of the readers, 
their motivations, background knowledge, and 
other internal characteristics play an important 
role in determining whether a text is readable for 
a particular group of people. In our work, we 
investigate how to assess the readability of a text 
for people with intellectual disabilities (ID). 
Previous work in automatic readability as-
sessment has focused on generic features of a 
text at the lexical and syntactic level.  While such 
features are essential, we argue that audience-
specific features that model the cognitive charac-
teristics of a user group can improve the accura-
cy of a readability assessment tool.  The contri-
butions of this paper are: (1) we present a corpus 
of texts with readability judgments from adults 
with ID; (2) we propose a set of cognitively-
motivated features which operate at the discourse 
level; (3) we evaluate the utility of these features 
in predicting readability for adults with ID. 
Our framework is to create tools that benefit 
people with intellectual disabilities (ID), specifi-
cally those classified in the “mild level” of men-
tal retardation, IQ scores 55-70.  About 3% of 
the U.S. population has intelligence test scores of 
70 or lower (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000).  People 
with ID face challenges in reading literacy.  They 
are better at decoding words (sounding them out) 
than at comprehending their meaning (Drew & 
Hardman, 2004), and most read below their men-
tal age-level (Katims, 2000).  Our research ad-
dresses two literacy impairments that distinguish 
people with ID from other low-literacy adults: 
limitations in (1) working memory and (2) dis-
course representation.  People with ID have 
problems remembering and inferring information 
from text (Fowler, 1998).  They have a slower 
speed of semantic encoding and thus units are 
lost from the working memory before they are 
processed (Perfetti & Lesgold, 1977; Hickson-
Bilsky, 1985).  People with ID also have trouble 
building cohesive representations of discourse 
(Hickson-Bilsky, 1985).  As less information is 
integrated into the mental representation of the 
current discourse, less is comprehended.   
Adults with ID are limited in their choice of 
reading material.  Most texts that they can readi-
ly understand are targeted at the level of reada-
bility of children.  However, the topics of these 
texts often fail to match their interests since they 
are meant for younger readers.  Because of the 
mismatch between their literacy and their inter-
ests, users may not read for pleasure and there-
fore miss valuable reading-skills practice time.  
In a feasibility study we conducted with adults 
229
with ID, we asked participants what they enjoyed 
learning or reading about.  The majority of our 
subjects mentioned enjoying watching the news, 
in particular local news.  Many mentioned they 
were interested in information that would be re-
levant to their daily lives.  While for some ge-
nres, human editors can prepare texts for these 
users, this is not practical for news sources that 
are frequently updated and specific to a limited 
geographic area (like local news). Our goal is to 
create an automatic metric to predict the reada-
bility of local news articles for adults with ID.  
Because of the low levels of written literacy 
among our target users, we intend to focus on 
comprehension of texts displayed on a computer 
screen and read aloud by text-to-speech software; 
although some users may depend on the text-to-
speech software, we use the term readability. 
This paper is organized as follows.  Section 2 
presents related work on readability assessment. 
Section 3 states our research hypotheses and de-
scribes our methodology.  Section 4 focuses on 
the data sets used in our experiments, while sec-
tion 5 describes the feature set we used for rea-
dability assessment along with a corpus-based 
analysis of each feature.  Section 6 describes a 
readability assessment tool and reports on evalu-
ation.  Section 7 discusses the implications of the 
work and proposes direction for future work. 
2 Related Work on Readability Metrics 
Many readability metrics have been established 
as a function of shallow features of texts, such as 
the number of syllables per word and number of 
words per sentence (Flesch, 1948; McLaughlin, 
1969; Kincaid et al., 1975). These so-called tra-
ditional readability metrics are still used today in 
many settings and domains, in part because they 
are very easy to compute. Their results, however, 
are not always representative of the complexity 
of a text (Davison and Kantor, 1982). They can 
easily misrepresent the complexity of technical 
texts, or reveal themselves un-adapted to a set of 
readers with particular reading difficulties. Other 
formulas rely on lexical information; e.g., the 
New Dale-Chall readability formula consults a 
static, manually-built list of “easy” words to de-
termine whether a text contains unfamiliar words 
(Chall and Dale, 1995).  
Researchers in computational linguistics have 
investigated the use of statistical language mod-
els (unigram in particular) to capture the range of 
vocabulary from one grade level to another (Si 
and Callan, 2001; Collins-Thompson and Callan, 
2004). These metrics predicted readability better 
than traditional formulas when tested against a 
corpus of web pages. The use of syntactic fea-
tures was also investigated (Schwarm and Osten-
dorf, 2005; Heilman et al., 2007; Petersen and 
Ostendorf, 2009) in the assessment of text reada-
bility for English as a Second Language readers. 
While lexical features alone outperform syntactic 
features in classifying texts according to their 
reading levels, combining the lexical and syntac-
tic features yields the best results. 
Several elegant metrics that focus solely on 
the syntax of a text have also been developed.  
The Yngve (1960) measure, for instance, focuses 
on the depth of embedding of nodes in the parse 
tree; others use the ratio of terminal to non-
terminal nodes in the parse tree of a sentence 
(Miller and Chomsky, 1963; Frazier, 1985).  
These metrics have been used to analyze the 
writing of potential Alzheimer's patients to detect 
mild cognitive impairments (Roark, Mitchell, 
and Hollingshead, 2007), thereby indicating that 
cognitively motivated features of text are valua-
ble when creating tools for specific populations. 
Barzilay and Lapata (2008) presented early 
work in investigating the use of discourse to dis-
tinguish abridged from original encyclopedia 
articles.  Their focus, however, is on style detec-
tion rather than readability assessment per se.  
Coh-Metrix is a tool for automatically calculat-
ing text coherence based on features such as re-
petition of lexical items across sentences and 
latent semantic analysis (McNamara et al., 
2006).  The tool is based on comprehension data 
collected from children and college students. 
Our research differs from related work in that 
we seek to produce an automatic readability me-
tric that is tailored to the literacy skills of adults 
with ID.  Because of the specific cognitive cha-
racteristics of these users, it is an open question 
whether existing readability metrics and features 
are useful for assessing readability for adults 
with ID.  Many of these earlier metrics have fo-
cused on the task of assigning texts to particular 
elementary school grade levels.  Traditional 
grade levels may not be the ideal way to score 
texts to indicate how readable they are for adults 
with ID.  Other related work has used models of 
vocabulary (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 
2004).  Since we would like to use our tool to 
give adults with ID access to local news stories, 
we choose to keep our metric topic-independent. 
Another difference between our approach and 
previous approaches is that we have designed the 
features used by our readability metric based on 
230
the cognitive aspects of our target users.  For ex-
ample, these users are better at decoding words 
than at comprehending text meaning (Drew & 
Hardman, 2004); so, shallow features like “sylla-
ble count per word” or unigram models of word 
frequency (based on texts designed for children) 
may be less important indicators of reading diffi-
culty.  A critical challenge for our users is to 
create a cohesive representation of discourse.  
Due to their impairments in semantic encoding 
speed, our users may have particular difficulty 
with texts that place a significant burden on 
working memory (items fall out of memory be-
fore they can be semantically encoded).   
While we focus on readability of texts, other 
projects have automatically generated texts for 
people with aphasia (Carroll et al., 1999) or low 
reading skills (Williams and Reiter, 2005). 
3 Research Hypothesis and Methods 
We hypothesize that the complexity of a text for 
adults with ID is related to the number of entities 
referred to in the text overall.  If a paragraph or a 
text refers to too many entities at once, the reader 
has to work harder at mapping each entity to a 
semantic representation and deciding how each 
entity is related to others.  On the other hand, 
when a text refers to few entities, less work is 
required both for semantic encoding and for in-
tegrating the entities into a cohesive mental re-
presentation.  Section 5.2 discusses some novel 
discourse-level features (based on the “entity 
density” of a text) that we believe will correlate 
to comprehension by adults with ID.   
To test our hypothesis, we used the following 
methodology.  We collected four corpora (as de-
scribed in Section 4).  Three of them (Britannica, 
LiteracyNet and WeeklyReader) have been ex-
amined in previous work on readability.  The 
fourth (LocalNews) is novel and results from a 
user study we conducted with adults with ID.  
We then analyzed how significant each feature is 
on our Britannica and LiteracyNet corpora.  Fi-
nally, we combined the significant features into a 
linear regression model and experimented with 
several feature combinations. We evaluated our 
model on the WeeklyReader and LocalNews 
corpora. 
4 Corpora and Readability Judgments  
To study how certain linguistic features indicate 
the readability of a text, we collected a corpus of 
English text at different levels of readability.  An 
ideal corpus for our research would contain texts 
that have been written specifically for our au-
dience of adults with intellectual disabilities – in 
particular if such texts were paired with alternate 
versions of each text written for a general au-
dience.  We are not aware of such texts available 
electronically, and so we have instead mostly 
collected texts written for an audience of child-
ren.  The texts come from online and commercial 
sources, and some have been analyzed previous-
ly by text simplification researchers (Petersen 
and Ostendorf, 2009).  Our corpus also contains 
some novel texts produced as part of an experi-
mental study involving adults with ID. 
4.1 Paired and Graded Generic Corpora: 
Britannica, LiteracyNet, and Weekly 
Reader 
The first section of our corpus (which we refer to 
as Britannica) has 228 articles from the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica, originally collected by (Barzi-
lay and Elhadad, 2003).  This consists of 114 
articles in two forms: original articles written for 
adults and corresponding articles rewritten for an 
audience of children.  While the texts are paired, 
the content of the texts is not identical: some de-
tails are omitted from the child version, and addi-
tional background is sometimes inserted.  The 
resulting corpus is comparable in content. 
Because we are particularly interested in mak-
ing local news articles accessible to adults with 
ID, we collected a second paired corpus, which 
we refer to as LiteracyNet, consisting of 115 
news articles made available through (West-
ern/Pacific Literacy Network / LiteracyNet, 
2008).  The collection of local CNN stories is 
available in an original and simplified/abridged 
form (230 total news articles) designed for use in 
literacy education. 
The third corpus we collected (Weekly Reader) 
was obtained from the Weekly Reader corpora-
tion (Weekly Reader, 2008).  It contains articles 
for students in elementary school.  Each text is 
labeled with its target grade level (grade 2: 174 
articles, grade 3: 289 articles, grade 4: 428 ar-
ticles, grade 5: 542 articles).  Overall, the corpus 
has 1433 articles. (U.S. elementary school grades 
2 to 5 generally are for children ages 7 to 10.) 
The corpora discussed above are similar to 
those used by Petersen and Ostendorf (2009).  
While the focus of our research is adults with ID, 
most of the texts discussed in this section have 
been simplified or written by human authors to 
be readable for children.  Despite the texts being 
intended for a different audience than the focus 
of our research, we still believe these texts to be 
231
of value.  It is rare to encounter electronically 
available corpora in which an original and a sim-
plified version of a text is paired (as in the Bri-
tannica and LiteracyNet corpora) or texts labeled 
as being at specific levels of readability (as in the 
Weekly Reader corpus). 
4.2 Readability-Specific Corpus: LocalNews 
The final section of our corpus contains local 
news articles that are labeled with comprehen-
sion scores.  These texts were produced for a fea-
sibility study involving adults with ID.  Each text 
was read by adults with ID, who then answered 
comprehension questions to measure their under-
standing of the texts.  Unlike the previous corpo-
ra, LocalNews is novel and was not investigated 
by previous research in readability. 
After obtaining university approval for our ex-
perimental protocol and informed consent 
process, we conducted a study with 14 adults 
with mild intellectual disabilities who participate 
in daytime educational programs in the New 
York area.  Participants were presented with ten 
articles collected from various local New York 
based news websites.  Some subjects saw the 
original form of an article and others saw a sim-
plified form (edited by a human author); no sub-
ject saw both versions.  The texts were presented 
in random order using software that displayed 
the text on the screen, read it aloud using text-to-
speech software, and highlighted each word as it 
was read.  Afterward, subjects were asked aloud 
multiple-choice comprehension questions. We 
defined the readability score of a story as the 
percentage of correct answers averaged across 
the subjects who read that particular story. 
A human editor performed the text simplifica-
tion with the goal of making the text more reada-
ble for adults with mild ID.  The editor made the 
following types of changes to the original news 
stories: breaking apart complex sentences, un-
embedding information in complex prepositional 
phrases and reintegrating it as separate sentences, 
replacing infrequent vocabulary items with more 
common/colloquial equivalents, omitting sen-
tences and phrases from the story that mention 
entities and phrases extraneous to the main 
theme of the article.  For instance, the original 
sentence “They’re installing an induction loop 
system in cabs that would allow passengers with 
hearing aids to tune in specifically to the driver’s 
voice.” was transformed into “They’re installing 
a system in cabs. It would allow passengers with 
hearing aids to listen to the driver’s voice.” 
This corpus of local news articles that have 
been human edited and scored for comprehen-
sion by adults with ID is small in size (20 news 
articles), but we consider it a valuable resource.  
Unlike the texts that have been simplified for 
children (the rest of our corpus), these texts have 
been rated for readability by actual adults with 
ID.  Furthermore, comprehension scores are de-
rived from actual reader comprehension tests, 
rather than self-perceived comprehension.  Be-
cause of the small size of this part of our corpus, 
however, we primarily use it for evaluation pur-
poses (not for training the readability models). 
5 Linguistic Features and Readability  
We now describe the set of features we investi-
gated for assessing readability automatically.  
Table 1 contains a list of the features – including 
a short code name for each feature which may be 
used throughout this paper.  We have begun by 
implementing the simple features used by the 
Flesh-Kincaid and FOG metrics: average number 
of words per sentence, average number of syl-
lables per word, and percentage of words in the 
document with 3+ syllables. 
5.1 Basic Features Used in Earlier Work 
We have also implemented features inspired by 
earlier research on readability.  Petersen and Os-
tendorf (2009) included features calculated from 
parsing the sentences in their corpus using the 
Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000): average parse 
tree height, average number of noun phrases per 
sentence, average number of verb phrases per 
sentence, and average number of SBARs per sen-
tence. We have implemented versions of most of 
these parse-tree-related features for our project.  
We also parse the sentences in our corpus using 
Charniak’s parser and calculate the following 
features listed in Table 1: aNP, aN, aVP, aAdj, 
aSBr, aPP, nNP, nN, nVP, nAdj, nSBr, and nPP.   
5.2 Novel Cognitively-Motivated Features  
Because of the special reading characteristics of 
our target users, we have designed a set of cogni-
tively motivated features to predict readability of 
texts for adults with ID.  We have discussed how 
working memory limits the semantic encoding of 
new information by these users; so, our features 
indicate the number of entities in a text that the 
reader must keep in mind while reading each 
sentence and throughout the entire document.  It 
is our hypothesis that this “entity density” of a 
232
text plays an important role in the difficulty of 
that text for readers with intellectual disabilities. 
The first set of features incorporates the Ling-
Pipe named entity detection software (Alias-i, 
2008), which detects three types of entities: per-
son, location, and organization.  We also use the 
part-of-speech tagger in LingPipe to identify the 
common nouns in the document, and we find the 
union of the common nouns and the named entity 
noun phrases in the text.  The union of these two 
sets is our definition of “entity” for this set of 
features.  We count both the total number of 
“entity mentions” in a text (each token appear-
ance of an entity) and the total number of unique 
entities (exact-string-match duplicates only 
counted once).  Table 1 lists these features: nEM, 
nUE, aEM, and aUE.  We count the totals per 
document to capture how many entities the read-
er must keep track of while reading the docu-
ment.  We also expect sentences with more enti-
ties to be more difficult for our users to semanti-
cally encode due to working memory limitations; 
so, we also count the averages per sentence to 
capture how many entities the reader must keep 
in mind to understand each sentence.   
To measure the working memory burden of a 
text, we’d like to capture the number of dis-
course entities that a reader must keep in mind.  
However, the “unique entities” identified by the 
named entity recognition tool may not be a per-
fect representation of this – several unique enti-
ties may actually refer to the same real-world 
entity under discussion.  To better model how 
multiple noun phrases in a text refer to the same 
entity or concept, we have also built features us-
ing lexical chains (Galley and McKeown, 2003).  
Lexical chains link nouns in a document con-
nected by relations like synonymy or hyponomy; 
chains can indicate concepts that recur through-
out a text.  A lexical chain has both a length 
(number of noun phrases it includes) and a span 
(number of words in the document between the 
first noun phrase at the beginning of the chain 
and the last noun phrase that is part of the chain).  
We calculate the number of lexical chains in the 
document (nLC) and those with a span greater 
than half the document length (nLC2).  We be-
lieve these features may indicate the number of 
entities/concepts that a reader must keep in mind 
during a document and the subset of very impor-
tant entities/concepts that are the main topic of 
the document.  The average length and average 
span of the lexical chains in a document (aLCL 
and aLCS) may also indicate how many of the 
chains in the document are short-lived, which 
may mean that they are ancillary enti-
ties/concepts, not the main topics. 
The final two features in Table 1 (aLCw and 
aLCe) use the concept of an “active” chain.  At a 
particular location in a text, we define a lexical 
chain to be “active” if the span (between the first 
and last noun in the lexical chain) includes the 
current location.  We expect these features may 
indicate the total number of concepts that the 
reader needs to keep in mind during a specific 
moment in time when reading a text.  Measuring 
the average number of concepts that the reader of 
a text must keep in mind may suggest the work-
ing memory burden of the text over time.  We 
were unsure if individual words or individual 
noun-phrases in the document should be used as 
the basic unit of “time” for the purpose of aver-
aging the number of active lexical chains; so, we 
included both features. 
5.3 Testing the Significance of Features 
To select which features to include in our auto-
matic readability assessment tool (in Section 6),

Table 1: Implemented Features
233
we analyzed the documents in our paired corpora 
(Britannica and LiteracyNet).  Because they con-
tain a complex and a simplified version of each 
article, we can examine differences in readability 
while holding the topic and genre constant.  We 
calculated the value of each feature for each doc-
ument, and we used a paired t-test to determine if 
the difference between the complex and simple 
documents was significant for that corpus. 
Table 2 contains the results of this feature se-
lection process; the columns in the table indicate 
the values for the following corpora: Britannica 
complex, Britannica simple, LiteracyNet com-
plex, and LiteracyNet simple.  An asterisk ap-
pears in the “Sig” column if the difference be-
tween the feature values for the complex vs. 
simple documents is statistically significant for 
that corpus (significance level: p<0.00001).   
The only two features which did not show a 
significant difference (p>0.01) between the com-
plex and simple versions of the articles were: 
average lexical chain length (aLCL) and number 
of lexical chains with span greater than half the 
document length (nLC2).  The lack of signific-
ance for aLCL may be explained by the vast ma-
jority of lexical chains containing few members; 
complex articles contained more of these chains 
– but their chains did not contain more members.  
In the case of nLC2, over 80% of the articles in 
each category contained no lexical chains whose 
span was greater than half the document length.  
The rarity of a lexical chain spanning the majori-
ty of a document may have led to there being no 
significant difference between complex/simple. 
6 A Readability Assessment Tool 
After testing the significance of features using 
paired corpora, we used linear regression and our 
graded corpus (Weekly Reader) to build a reada-
bility assessment tool.  To evaluate the tool’s 
usefulness for adults with ID, we test the correla-
tion of its scores with the LocalNews corpus. 
6.1 Versions of Our Model 
We began our evaluation by implementing three 
versions of our automatic readability assessment 
tool.  The first version uses only those features 
studied by previous researchers (aWPS, aSPW, 
%3+S, aNP, aN, aVP, aAdj, aSBr, aPP, nNP, nN, 
nVP, nAdj, nSBr, nPP).  The second version uses 
only our novel cognitively motivated features 
(section 5.2).  The third version uses the union of 
both sets of features.  By building three versions 
of the tool, we can compare the relative impact 
of our novel cognitively-motivated features.  For 
all versions, we have only included those fea-
tures that showed a significant difference be-
tween the complex and simple articles in our 
paired corpora (as discussed in section 5.3). 
6.2 Learning Technique and Training Data 
Early work on automatic readability analysis 
framed the problem as a classification task: 
creating multiple classifiers for labeling a text as 
being one of several elementary school grade 
levels (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).  
Because we are focusing on a unique user group 
with special reading challenges, we do not know 
a priori what level of text difficulty is ideal for 
our users.  We would not know where to draw 
category boundaries for classification.  We also 
prefer that our assessment tool assign numerical 
difficulty scores to texts.  Thus, after creating 
this tool, we can conduct further reading com-
prehension experiments with adults with ID to 
determine what threshold (for readability scores 
assigned by our tool) is appropriate for our users.

Table 2: Feature Values of Paired Corpora
234
To select features for our model, we used our 
paired corpora (Britannica and LiteracyNet) to 
measure the significance of each feature.  Now 
that we are training a model, we make use of our 
graded corpus (articles from Weekly Reader).  
This corpus contains articles that have each been 
labeled with an elementary school grade level for 
which it was written.  We divide this corpus – 
using 80% of articles as training data and 20% as 
testing data.  We model the grade level of the 
articles using linear regression; our model is im-
plemented using R (R Development Core Team, 
2008).  
6.3 Evaluation of Our Readability Tool 
We conducted two rounds of training and evalua-
tion of our three regression models.  We also 
compare our models to a baseline readability as-
sessment tool: the popular Flesh-Kincaid Grade 
Level index (Kincaid et al., 1975).  
In the first round of evaluation, we trained and 
tested our regression models on the Weekly 
Reader corpus.  This round of evaluation helped 
to determine whether our feature-set and regres-
sion technique were successfully modeling those 
aspects of the texts that were relevant to their 
grade level.  Our results from this round of eval-
uation are presented in the form of average error 
scores.  (For each article in the Weekly Reader 
testing data, we calculate the difference between 
the output score of the model and the correct 
grade-level for that article.)  Table 3 presents the 
average error results for the baseline system and 
our three regression models.  We can see that the 
model trained on the shallow and parse-related 
features out-performs the model trained only on 
our novel features; however, the best model 
overall is the one is trained on all of the features.  
This model predicts the grade level of Weekly 
Reader articles to within roughly 0.565 grade 
levels on average.   
 
Readability Model (or baseline) Average Error 
Baseline: Flesh-Kincaid Index 2.569 
Basic Features Only 0.6032 
Cognitively Motivated Features Only 0.6110 
Basic + Cognitively-Motiv. Features 0.5650 
Table 3: Predicting Grade Level of Weekly Reader 
 
In our second round of evaluation, we trained 
the regression model on the Weekly Reader cor-
pus, but we tested it against the LocalNews cor-
pus.  We measured the correlation between our 
regression models’ output and the comprehen-
sion scores of adults with ID on each text.  For 
this reason, we do not calculate the “average er-
ror”; instead, we simply measure the correlation 
between the models’ output and the comprehen-
sion scores. (We expect negative correlations 
because comprehension scores should increase as 
the predicted grade level of the text goes down.)  
Table 4 presents the correlations for our three 
models and the baseline system in the form of 
Pearson’s R-values.  We see a surprising result: 
the model trained only on the cognitively-
motivated features is more tightly correlated with 
the comprehension scores of the adults with ID.  
While the model trained on all features was bet-
ter at assigning grade levels to Weekly Reader 
articles, when we tested it on the local news ar-
ticles from our user-study, it was not the top-
performing model.  This result suggests that the 
shallow and parse-related features of texts de-
signed for children (the Weekly Reader articles, 
our training data) are not the best predictors of 
text readability for adults with ID.   
 
Readability Model (or baseline) Pearson’s R 
Baseline: Flesh-Kincaid Index -0.270 
Basic Features Only -0.283 
Cognitively Motivated Features Only -0.352 
Basic + Cognitively-Motiv. Features -0.342 
Table 4: Correlation to User-Study Comprehension 
7 Discussion 
Based on the cognitive and literacy skills of 
adults with ID, we designed novel features that 
were useful in assessing the readability of texts 
for these users.  The results of our study have 
supported our hypothesis that the complexity of a 
text for adults with ID is related to the number of 
entities referred to in the text.  These “entity den-
sity” features enabled us to build models that 
were better at predicting text readability for 
adults with intellectual disabilities.  
This study has also demonstrated the value of 
collecting readability judgments from target us-
ers when designing a readability assessment tool.  
The results in Table 4 suggest that models 
trained on corpora containing texts designed for 
children may not always lead to accurate models 
of the readability of texts for other groups of 
low-literacy users.  Using features targeting spe-
cific aspects of literacy impairment have allowed 
us to make better use of children’s texts when 
designing a model for adults with ID. 
7.1 Future Work 
In order to study more features and models of 
readability, we will require more testing data for 
tracking progress of our readability regression 
235
models.  Our current study has illustrated the 
usefulness of texts that have been evaluated by 
adults with ID, and we therefore plan to increase 
the size of this corpus in future work.   In addi-
tion to using this corpus for evaluation, we may 
want to use it to train our regression models.  For 
this study, we trained on Weekly Reader text 
labeled with elementary school grade levels, but 
this is not ideal.  Texts designed for children may 
differ from those that are best for adults with ID, 
and “grade levels” may not be the best way to 
rank/rate text readability for these users.  While 
our user-study comprehension-test corpus is cur-
rently too small for training, we intend to grow 
the size of this corpus in future work.   
We also plan on refining our cognitively moti-
vated features for measuring the difficulty of a 
text for our users.  Currently, we use lexical 
chain software to link noun phrases in a docu-
ment that may refer to similar entities/concepts.  
In future work, we plan to use co-reference reso-
lution software to model how multiple “entity 
mentions” may refer to a single discourse entity.  
For comparison purposes, we plan to imple-
ment other features that have been used in earlier 
readability assessment systems.  For example, 
Petersen and Ostendorf (2009) created lists of the 
most common words from the Weekly Reader 
articles, and they used the percentage of words in 
a document not on this list as a feature.   
The overall goal of our research is to develop 
a software system that can automatically simplify 
the reading level of local news articles and 
present them in an accessible way to adults with 
ID.  Our automatic readability assessment tool 
will be a component in this future text simplifica-
tion system.  We have therefore preferred to in-
clude features in our tool that focus on aspects of 
the text that can be modified during a simplifica-
tion process.  In future work, we will study how 
to use our readability assessment tool to guide 
how a text revision system decides to modify a 
text to increase its readability for these users. 
7.2 Summary of Contributions 
We have contributed to research on automatic 
readability assessment by designing a new me-
thod for assessing the complexity of a text at the 
level of discourse.  Our novel “entity density” 
features are based on named entity and lexical 
chain software, and they are inspired by the cog-
nitive underpinnings of the literacy challenges of 
adults with ID – specifically, the role of slow 
semantic encoding and working memory limita-
tions.  We have demonstrated the usefulness of 
these novel features in modeling the grade level 
of elementary school texts and in correlating to 
readability judgments from adults with ID.   
Another contribution of our work is the collec-
tion of an initial corpus of texts of local news 
stories that have been manually simplified by a 
human editor.  Both the original and the simpli-
fied versions of these stories have been evaluated 
by adults with intellectual disabilities.  We have 
used these comprehension scores in the evalua-
tion phase of this study, and we have suggested 
how constructing a larger corpus of such articles 
could be useful for training readability tools. 
More broadly, this project has demonstrated 
how focusing on a specific user population, ana-
lyzing their cognitive skills, and involving them 
in a user-study has led to new insights in model-
ing text readability.  As Dale and Chall’s defini-
tion (1949) originally argued, characteristics of 
the reader are central to the issue of readability.  
We believe our user-focused research paradigm 
may be used to drive further advances in reada-
bility assessment for other groups of users.
