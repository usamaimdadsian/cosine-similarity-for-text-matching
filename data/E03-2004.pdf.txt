Abstract
We demonstrate the production of spo-
ken output with contextually appropri-
ate intonation in the information-state
based dialogue system GoDiS. We ex-
ploit the context representation in the in-
formation state to determine the infor-
mation structure of system utterances,
which we use to control the intonation
of synthesized spoken output.
1 Introduction
Producing spoken output with contextually ap-
propriate intonation is one of the challenges for
flexible dialogue systems with dynamically con-
structed output and synthesized speech. It is a well
known fact that intonation reflects the relation of
an utterance to the context, and that contextually
inappropriate intonation may have negative effect
on intelligibility or lead to confusion.
We demonstrate improvements of contextual
appropriateness of English and German intonation
in the GoDiS system. Intonation is controlled by
information structure, which is determined from
the context representation in the information state
of the system using the information-state update
approach to dialogue.
This note is structured as follows. In §2 we give
an overview of GoDiS and its information-state
update approach. In §3 we introduce the infor-
mation structure partitioning we employ, and the
rules we use to determine it from the information
state. In §4 we describe the generation of spo-
ken output with contextually varied intonation in
GoDiS using the FESTIVAL and MARY text-to-
speech synthesis systems. In §5 we summarize
and indicate our further research plans.
2 GoDiS
GoDiS (Gothenburg Dialogue System) is an ex-
perimental dialogue system implemented using
the TrindiKit, a toolkit for implementing dialogue
move engines and dialogue systems based on
the information-state update approach (TRINDI,
2001; Larsson and Traum, to appear).
One of the goals of the information-state update
approach is to encourage modularity, reusability
and plug-and-play; to demonstrate this, GoDiS
has been adapted to several different dialogue
types (information-seeking, action-oriented), do-
mains (travel agency, autoroute, mobile phone,
VCR) and languages (English, Swedish, German)
(Larsson, 2002).Speech input and output are also
supported in GoDiS.
The GoDiS architecture is shown in Fig. 1. It is
an instantiation of the general TrindiKit architec-
ture (Larsson and Ericsson, 2002).
The information state in GoDiS represented as
a record (Fig. 2) is a modified version of the di-
alogue game board (Ginzburg, 1996). The main
division is between information which is PRIVATE
to an agent and that which is SHARED between
agents. In PRIVATE, the PLAN field contains a list
of long-term goals; AGENDA contains more im-
mediate dialogue actions; BEL is a set of assumed
propositions; TMP keeps track of information that

Figure 1: GoDiS architecture
has not yet been grounded. The SHARED part con-
tains information about the latest utterance, a set
of established shared commitments and a stack of
questions raised in the dialogue that are currently
under discussion.
What we concentrate on in this demonstration
is our extension of GoDiS, enabling it to dynami-
cally produce contextually appropriate intonation
by assigning the system utterances information
structure partitioning according to the information
state, and controlling the output intonation accord-
ingly.
3 Information Structure
Information structure (IS) refers to the organiza-
tion speakers impose on their utterances to relate
them to the context (what they believe is shared)
and the intended context change (corresponding to
their communicative intentions).
The approach to IS we employ follows (Steed-
man, 2000). This choice is motivated by the in-
sights that Steedman incorporates and the degree
of their explicit formalization. We thus use two di-
mensions of IS: (i) a partitioning into Theme and
Rheme, corresponding to a semantic aboutness re-
lation; and (ii) a further partitioning of both Theme
and Rheme into Background and Focus, reflect-
ing a contrast between alternatives in the context
against which the actual Theme and Rheme are
cast. E.g., the IS-partitioning suitable in the con-
text of The heater in the hall is out. But what is
the status of the light in the hail?:'

3.1 Information structure and Intonation
Intonation is one of the means by which IS can be
realized. For English, Steedman has argued that
IS is homomorphic to intonation structure:
The Theme/Rheme partitioning determines the
overall intonation pattern: different accents are
used within the Theme (L+H*, L*+H) and within
the Rheme (H*, L*, H*+L, H+L*).
The Focus/Background partitioning determines
the placement of pitch accents: they are assigned
to the words realizing the Focus within Theme and
Rheme. A Rheme must always contain a Focus,
while Themes can be unmarked (without Focus)
or marked (with Focus).
Tunes are obtained by combining accents
with appropriate boundaries and boundary tones.
Steedman has argued that the contour H*LL°/0 is
one of the "rheme tunes" in assertions in English,
and L+H*LH`)/0 is a (marked) Theme-tune. For
German, we adopt H+L*LL% as a default rheme
tune, and L+H*H-% for a marked theme (these
accents are the ones implemented as defaults in
the Mary system we use to synthesise German; cf.
(Kruijir-Korbayova et al., 2003) for more discus-
sion).2
3.2 Information Structure Determination
We have implemented IS-assignment to system
moves in GoDiS as a module invoked from the se-
lection algorithm (cf. Fig. 1). The module takes as
input the propositional content of a dialogue move,
and returns this content IS-partitioned. The pro-
cess of IS assignment has several phases shown
schematically in Fig. 3.

First, the QudTR rule partitions the content
into Rheme and Theme, according to the ques-
tion topmost on QUD. Next, the determination
of the Background/Focus partitioning within each
Theme and Rheme is done using a notion of (se-
mantic) parallelism, by two complementary rules
which differ in what the source of alternatives is
taken to be: The ComFB rule tries to assign Fo-
cus on the basis of the previous dialogue context,
looking for alternatives in the SHARED.COM field
of the information state. If this fails to assign any
Focus, the rule DomFB assigns Focus by looking
for alternatives in the domain representation. (See
(Prevost, 1995) for a similar algorithm.)
The IS partitioning of a dialogue move content
is encoded by the operators rh for Rheme, foc_rh
for Rheme-Focus and foc_th for Theme-Focus.
Finally, the IS-partitioned content is sent to the
generation module, which produces a string of
words with an annotation of the IS partitioning
using an internal set of labels <RH> , <F_RH> and
<F_TH>, respectively.
4 Producing Speech Output with
Intonation Variation
In order to produce contextually varied synthe-
sized speech output we use the FESTIVAL TTS
for English and the MARY TTS for German which
are publicly available. We chose these systems be-
cause they support not only the SABLE intonation
mark up standard, 3 but also a more abstract ToBI-
based intonation annotation.
FESTIVAL is a multi-lingual TTS system de-
veloped at CSTR, University of Edinburgh. We
http://wwwl.bell-labs.corn/projectitts/sable.html
use an experimental set of patches (APA4L) de-
veloped by Robert Clark at the University of Ed-
inburgh, that allows to annotate FESTIVAL in-
put with higher levels of information including
speech-act type and turn-talking information, as
well as a ToBI-based intonation markup.
MARY (SchrOder and Trouvain, 2001) is a TTS
System developed by the DFKI language technol-
ogy lab and the Institute of Phonetics at Saarland
University. MARY supports the full inventory of
tones defined in GToBI, and allows partial annota-
tion at any level in its input.
The integration of FESTIVAL and MARY into
GoDiS is shown in Fig. 4. The interface be-
tween GoDiS and MARY/FESTIVAL works as
follows: The output module of GoDiS takes a
string annotated with IS partitioning and calls
a Linux/Unix shell. A program written in
PERL converts the string into the correspond-
ing SABLE/MaryXML/APML tags. The result
is saved into a SABLE/MaryXML/APML out-
put file. The mapping of tags for German using
MaryXML is shown in Table 1, for English using
APML in FESTIVAL in Table 2.
Both MARY and FESTIVAL can be run
locally or as servers. The output mod-
ule of GoDiS calls a Linux/Unix shell and
sends the SABLE/MaryXML/APML file to
MARY/FESTIVAL.
More detailed information about the system can
be found in (Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2002).
5 Summary and Future Work
Our goal is to explore the use of the information
state in GoDiS to control the intonation of system

mentation using the FESTIVAL and MARY TTS
systems which support the SABLE standard as well
as a ToBI-based intonation markup.
Our implementation allows us to test hypothe-
ses concerning contextually appropriate intonation
in dialogue. A pilot evaluation of the German out-
put produced with MARY yielded encouraging re-
sults suggesting that in general users find the con-
trolled contextually appropriate intonation better
(Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2003).
Although we have so far only exploited intona-
tion, one goal for the future is to let various infor-
mation structure realization means interplay. 4
