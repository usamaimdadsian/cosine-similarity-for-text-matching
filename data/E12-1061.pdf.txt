Learning Language from Perceptual Context

Abstract
Machine learning has become the dominant approach to building natural-language processing sys-
tems. However, current approaches generally require a great deal of laboriously constructed human-
annotated training data. Ideally, a computer would be able to acquire language like a child by being
exposed to linguistic input in the context of a relevant but ambiguous perceptual environment. As
a step in this direction, we have developed systems that learn to sportscast simulated robot soccer
games and to follow navigation instructions in virtual environments by simply observing sample hu-
man linguistic behavior in context. This work builds on our earlier work on supervised learning of
semantic parsers that map natural language into a formal meaning representation. In order to apply
such methods to learning from observation, we have developed methods that estimate the meaning of
sentences given just their ambiguous perceptual context.
