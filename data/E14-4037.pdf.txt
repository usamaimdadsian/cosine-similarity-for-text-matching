Abstract
Professional human translators usually do
not employ the concept of word align-
ments, producing translations ‘sense-for-
sense’ instead of ‘word-for-word’. This
suggests that unalignable words may be
prevalent in the parallel text used for ma-
chine translation (MT). We analyze this
phenomenon in-depth for Chinese-English
translation. We further propose a sim-
ple and effective method to improve au-
tomatic word alignment by pre-removing
unalignable words, and show improve-
ments on hierarchical MT systems in both
translation directions.
1 Motivation
It is generally acknowledged that absolute equiva-
lence between two languages is impossible, since
concept lexicalization varies across languages.
Major translation theories thus argue that texts
should be translated ‘sense-for-sense’ instead of
‘word-for-word’ (Nida, 1964). This suggests that
unalignable words may be an issue for the parallel
text used to train current statistical machine trans-
lation (SMT) systems. Although existing auto-
matic word alignment methods have some mech-
anism to handle the lack of exact word-for-word
alignment (e.g. null probabilities, fertility in the
IBM models (Brown et al., 1993)), they may be
too coarse-grained to model the ’sense-for-sense’
translations created by professional human trans-
lators.
For example, the Chinese term ‘tai-yang’ liter-
ally means ‘sun’, yet the concept it represents is
equivalent to the English term ‘the sun’. Since the
concept of a definite article is not incorporated in
the morphology of ‘tai yang’, the added ‘the’ is
not aligned to any Chinese word. Yet in another
context like ’the man’, ‘the’ can be the translation
of the Chinese demonstrative pronoun ‘na’, liter-
ally means ‘that’. A potential misunderstanding is
that unalignable words are simply function words;
but from the above example, we see that whether a
word is alignable depends very much on the con-
cept and the linguistic context.
As the quantity and quality of professionally-
created parallel text increase, we believe there is a
need to examine the question of unalignable words
in-depth. Our goal is to gain a better understand-
ing of what makes a fluent human translation and
use this insight to build better word aligners and
MT systems. Our contributions are two-fold:
1) We analyze 13000 sentences of manually word-
aligned Chinese-English parallel text, quantifying
the characteristics of unalignable words.
2) We propose a simple and effective way to im-
prove automatic word alignment, based on pre-
dicting unalignable words and temporarily remov-
ing them during the alignment training procedure.
2 Analysis of Unalignable Words
Our manually-aligned data, which we call OR-
ACLE data, is a Chinese-to-English corpus re-
leased by the LDC (Li et al., 2010)
1
. It con-
sists of ?13000 Chinese sentences from news and
blog domains and their English translation . En-
glish words are manually aligned with the Chinese
characters. Characters without an exact counter-
part are annotated with categories that state the
functions of the words. These characters are ei-
ther aligned to ‘NULL’, or attached to their depen-
dency heads, if any, and aligned together to form
a multi-word alignment. For example, ‘the’ is an-
notated as [DET], for ‘determiner’, and aligned to
‘tai-yang’ together with ‘sun’.
In this work, any English word or Chinese char-
acter without an exact counterpart are called un-
alignable words, since they are not core to the

multi-word alignment. All other English words or
Chinese characters are referred to as core words.
2.1 What kind of words are unalignable?
Analyzing the hand aligned corpus, we find that
words annotated as unalignable do not come from
a distinct list. Table 1 reveals that 88% of the
word types are unambiguously core words. Yet
these word types, including singletons, account
for only 17% of the word tokens. On the other
hand, another 17% of the total word tokens are
annotated as unalignable. So, most word types are
possibly unalignable but only in a small portion of
their occurrence, such as the following examples:
(1a) Chi: yi ge di fang
one (measure word) place
Eng: one place
(1b) Chi: ge ren
personal
Eng: personal
(2a) Chi: ming tian zhong wu
(tomorrow) (midday)
Eng: tomorrow at midday
(2b) Chi: zai jia
at/in/on home
Eng: at home
In example (1a), ‘ge’ is a measure word that is
exclusive in Chinese, but in (1b), it is part of the
multiword unit ’ge-ren’ for ’personal’. Similarly,
prepositions, such as ‘at’, can either be omitted or
translated depending on context.
Nonetheless, unalignable words are by no
means evenly distributed among word types. Ta-
ble 2 shows that the top 100 most frequent un-
alignable word types already covers 78% and 94%
of all Chinese and English unalignable instances,
respectively. Word type is thus an important clue.
Intuitively, words with POS defined only in one
of the languages are likely to be unalignable. To
examine this, we automatically tagged the ORA-
CLE data using the Standford Tagger (Toutanova

Table 2: Count of unalignable words by types
et al., 2003). We find that the unalignable words
include all POS categories of either language,
though indeed some POS are more frequent. Ta-
ble 3 lists the top 5 POS categories that most un-
alignable words belong to and the percentage they
are annotated as unalignable. Some POS cate-
gories like DEG are mostly unalignable regardless
of context, but other POS tags such as DT and IN
depend on context.

VV 4950 (6%) CC 4145 (36%)
Table 3: Top 5 POS categories of Chinese and En-
glish unalignable words
Note also that many Chinese unalignable words
are nouns (NN) and verbs (VV). Clearly we cannot
indiscriminately consider all nouns as unalignable.
Some examples of unalignable content words in
Chinese are:
(3) Chi: can jia hui jian huo dong
participate meeting activity
Eng: participate in the meeting
(4) Chi: hui yi de yuan man ju xing
meeting ’s successful take place
Eng: success of the meeting
English verbs and adjectives are often nomi-
nalized to abstract nouns (such as ’meeting’ from
’meet’, or ’success’ from ’succeed’), but such
derivation is rare in Chinese morphology. Since
POS is not morphologically marked in Chinese,
’meeting’ and’meet’ are the same word. To reduce
the processing ambiguity and produce more nat-
ural translation, extra content words are added to
mark the nominalization of abstract concepts. For
example, ‘hui jian’ is originally ‘to meet’. Adding
‘huo dong’(activity) transforms it to a noun phrase
191
(example 3), similar to the the addition of ‘ju
sing’(take place) to the adjective ‘yuan man’ (ex-
ample 4). These unalignable words are not lexi-
cally dependent but are inferred from the context,
and thus do not align to any source words.
To summarize, a small number of word types
cover 17% of word tokens that are unalignable,
but whether these words are unalignable depends
significantly on context. Although there is no list
of ‘always unalignable’ words types or POS cat-
egories, our analysis shows there are regularities
that may be exploited by an automatic classifier.
3 Improved Automatic Word Alignment
We first propose a classifier for predicting whether
a word is unalignable. Let (e
J
1
, f
K
1
) be a pair of
sentence with length J and K. For each word in
(e
J
1
, f
K
1
) that belongs to a predefined list
2
of po-
tentially unalignable words, we run a binary clas-
sifier. A separate classifier is built for each word
type in the list, and an additional classifier for all
the remaining words in each language.
We train an SVM classifier based on the fol-
lowing features: Local context: Unigrams and
POS in window sizes of 1, 3, 5, 7 around the
word in question. Top token-POS pairs: This
feature is defined by whether the token in ques-
tion and its POS tag is within the top n frequent
token-POS pairs annotated as unalignable like in
Tables 2 and 3. Four features are defined with n =
10, 30, 50, 100. Since the top frequent unalignable
words cover most of the counts as shown in the
previous analysis, being in the top n list is a strong
positive features. Number of likely unalignable
words per sentence: We hypothesize that the
translator will not add too many tokens to the
translation and delete too many from the source
sentence. In the ORACLE data, 68% sentences
have more than 2 unalignable words. We approx-
imate the number of likely unalignable words in
the sentence by counting the number of words
within the top 100 token-POS pairs annotated as
unalignable. Sentence length and ratio: Longer
sentences are more likely to contain unalignable
words than shorter sentences. Also sentence ra-
tios that deviate significantly from the mean are
likely to contain unalignable words. Presence of
alignment candidate: This is a negative feature
defined by whether there is an alignment candi-

to the hand annotated data.
date in the target sentence for the source word in
question, or vice versa. The candidates are ex-
tracted from the top n frequent words aligned to
a particular word according to the manual align-
ments of the ORACLE data. Five features are de-
fined with n = 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and one ’without
limit’, such that a more possible candidate will be
detected by more features.
Next, we propose a simple yet effective mod-
ification to the word alignment training pipeline:
1. Predict unalignable words by the classifier
2. Remove these words from the training corpus
3. Train word alignment model (e.g. GIZA++)
3
4. Combine the word alignments in both direc-
tions with heuristics (grow-diag-final-and)
5. Restore unaligned words to original position
6. Continue with rule extraction and the rest of
the MT pipeline.
The idea is to reduce the difficulty for the word
alignment model by removing unaligned words.
4 End-to-End Translation Experiments
In our experiments, we first show that removing
manually-annotated unaligned words in ORACLE
data leads to improvements in MT of both trans-
lation directions. Next, we show how a classifier
trained on ORACLE data can be used to improve
MT in another large-scale un-annotated dataset.

4.1 Experiments on ORACLE data
We first performed an ORACLE experiment us-
ing gold standard unaligned word labels. Follow-
ing the training pipeline in Section 3, we removed
gold unalignable words before running GIZA++
and restore them afterwards. 90% of the data is
used for alignment and MT training, while 10% of
the data is reserved for testing.
The upper half of Table 4 list the alignment
precision, recall and F1 of the resulting align-
ments, and quality of the final MT outputs. Base-
line is the standard MT training pipeline with-
out removal of unaligned words. Our Proposed
approach performs better in alignment, phrase-
based (PBMT) and hierarchical (Hiero) systems.
The results, evaluated by BLEU, METEOR and
TER, support our hypothesis that removing gold
unalignable words helps improve word alignment
and the resulting SMT.

We can suppress the NULL probabilities of the model.

All experiments are done using standard settings for
Moses PBMT and Hiero with 4-gram LM and mslr-
bidirectional-fe reordering (Koehn et al., 2007). The clas-
sifier is trained using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011).

For comparison, a naive classifier that labels
all top-30 token-POS combinations as unalignable
performs poorly as expected (PBMT BLEU: 9.87
in C-E direction). We also evaluated our proposed
classifier on this task: the accuracy is 92% and it
achieves BLEU of 11.55 for PBMT and 10.84 for
Hiero in C-E direction, which is between the re-
sults of gold-unalign and baseline.
4.2 Experiments on large-scale REAL data
We next performed a more realistic experiment:
the classifier trained on ORACLE data is used to
automatically label a large data, which is then used
to train a MT system. This REAL data consists of
parallel text from the NIST OpenMT2008.

MT
experiments are performed in both directions.
The lower half of Table 4 shows the perfor-
mance of the resulting MT systems. We observe
that our proposed approach is still able to improve
over the baseline. In particular, Hiero achieved
statistical significant improvements in BLEU and
METEOR.

this suggests our method may be most effective in
improving systems where rule extraction is sen-

and 2010T03 (34M English words and 1.1M sentences).
Since we do not have access to all OpenMT data, e.g. FBIS,
our results may not be directly comparable to other systems
in the evaluation.

Interestingly, PBMT did better than Hiero in this setup.

ero and Syntax-based MT. Table 5 shows the lex-
ical translations for some rare Chinese words: the
baseline tends to incorrectly align these to func-
tion words (garbage collection), while the pro-
posed method’s translations are more reasonable.
To evaluate how much annotation is needed for
the classifier, we repeat experiments using differ-
ent proportions of the ORACLE data. Figure 1
shows training by 20% of the data (2600 sents.)
already leads to significant improvements (p <
0.05), which is a reasonable annotation effort.
5 Conclusion
We analyzed in-depth the phenomenon of un-
alignable words in parallel text, and show that
what is unalignable depends on the word’s concept
and context. We argue that this is not a trivial prob-
lem, but with an unalignable word classifier and
a simple modified MT training pipeline, we can
achieve small but significant gains in end-to-end
translation. In related work, the issue of dropped
pronouns (Chung and Gildea, 2010) and function
words (Setiawan et al., 2010; Nakazawa and Kuro-
hashi, 2012) have been found important in word
alignment, and (Fossum et al., 2008) showed that
syntax features are helpful for fixing alignments.
An interesting avenue of future work is to integrate
these ideas with ours, in particular by exploiting
syntax and viewing unalignable words as aligned
at a structure above the lexical level.
