Abstract 
Dialogue is a cooperative process in which 
each speech act of the participants con- 
tributes to the overall purpose of the dia- 
logne. Participating in a full dialogue im- 
plies understanding at each point of the 
dialogue session the role of each speech 
act with respect to the rest of the dia- 
logne. We concentrate in this paper on 
speech acts that diverge from the straight- 
forward unfolding of the dialogue. Such 
speech acts represent dialogue deviations. 
We analyze the representation of differ- 
ent types and degrees of deviations and 
present a plan revision mechanism for 
dialogue management that permits their 
treatment in the context of advice giving 
dialogues between a novice user and an ex- 
pert problem solver. 
1 A Sample Dialogue 
In ESPRIT project ESTEAM-3161, we 
are designing a dialoguer that manages 
the interaction between a novice user and

advice--giving expert systems. The test- 
bed application is personal financial in- 
vestment \[5\]. As an introduction to our 
paper, we present a dialogue in which the 
system obtains from the user the informa- 
tion needed to activate the financial expert 
system.

years you'll have $9,000. Let's return 
to the emergency fund, now. How much 
do you want to put in itf 
12,U: $5000. 
18,S: Tell me also the delay. 
14,U: I don't understand tohat is the delay of 
an emergency fund. 
15,S: The delay is how soon you can have 
your money back after asking for it. 5o, 
for your emergency fund, what is this 
delayf 
16,U: ~ days. 
17,S: Do you want a ftxed term investmentf 
18,U: No. 
19,S: ~o, it leaves $7,500 for your long-term 
investment. Is it okf 
20,U: I wanted $10000. 
21,S: If you want art investment plan for 
$~0,000 with an emergency fund of 
$5,000 and a cash-need of $7,500, then 
it only leaves $7,500 for a long-term in. 
vestment. If you want $I0,000 for a 
long-term investment, hen you should 
modify something else in your plan. 
22,U: Could I put $1~500 into the emergency 
fundf 
28,S: Ok. So, to sum up, you want to invest 
$~0,000, with $1~,500 in an emergency 
fund ~th  a delay of 1~ days, $7,500 
in a cash need to buy a $9000 car in 
I# years, no riffled-term investment, and 
$10,000 in a long-term investment. Is 
that dghtf 
24,U: That's fine. 
The above sample dialogue has a quite 
simple structure: presentation of the main 
sub-investment types and collection of in- 
formation from the user concerning each 
sub-investment. We notice, however, that 
at some points the user does not react di- 
rectly as the system would expect. For 
instance, in sentence 6, the user is asked 
about saving money in an emergency fund, 
but she wants to talk about buying her ear 
first. Later, in sentence 14, the user is un- 
able to answer a question about the delay 
of the emergency fund because she does 
not understand what such a delay is. 
Such reactions illustrate dialogue devia- 
tions. Dialogue deviations are sentences 
that diverge form the straightforward un- 
folding of the dialogue, while having a co- 
herent interpretation with respect o the 
whole dialogue. These unexpected reac- 
tions are inevitable in a dialogue where the 
participants are independent agents with 
their own goals and differing degrees of 
knowledge about each other and the sub- 
ject under discussion. 
Before describing our dialogue manager 
and its mechanism for handling such devi- 
ations, we present in the next section the 
framework we adopted to model flexible 
dialogue management. 
2 Deviat ions in Dialogue 
Dialogue is considered to be a coopera- 
tive activity where the goals and actions 
of each participant contribute to the over- 
all purpose of the dialogue \[3\]. In task- 
oriented ialogues, we distinguish between 
task level goals and plans (e.g., investing, 
traveling), and communicative l vel inten- 
tions and speech acts (e.g., explaining, re- 
questing information) \[2,6,11\]. We call 
154 - 
these aspects the intentional dimension. 
Each step in the dialogue concerns a par- 
ticular topic. Intuitively the notion of 
topic might be described by a subset of ob- 
jects of the problem under discussion. In 
fact, the boundary of this asubset ~is not 
strict: one can only say that some objects 
are more salient than others. The atten- 
tional state is hence better epresented by 
different levels in the focus of attention, 
corresponding to embedded subsets of ob- 
jects \[9\]. 
It is important o note that in the con- 
text of dialogue, the term deviation is not 
used with its strict boolean meaning: it is 
a complex and a relative notion. 
Deviation are complex because they in- 
volve both intentional and attentional di- 
mensions. Deviations in this coopera- 
tive process arise from inconsistencies be- 
tween the observed speech act and the di- 
alogue considered as a coherent plan \[4\]. 
They can be classified according to the 
type of interactions among of interactions 
among intentions of the participants and 
and changes on the focus of attention. The 
sample session above illustrates several 
types of such deviations: at the commu- 
nicative level, the novice user requests for 
explanations before giving a requested in- 
formation; at the task level, the user gives 
an inconsistent value or does not want a 
given action in the task plan. Deviations 
are generally combined with changes of 
sub jets. 
Within each dimension there exist differ- 
ent degrees of deviations: speech acts may 
have indirect effects, changes in the fo- 
cus of attention may be be more or less 
abrupt, deviations depend on the expecta- 
tions each participant has concerning the 
reactions of the other. 
Therefore, we adopted models of the dia- 
logue structure where the relationship be- 
tween the intentions and the evolution of 
the focus of attention are made explicit 
\[10\]. 
The detection and analysis of deviation af- 
ter a user speech act relies on expectations 
and predictions in both the intentional and 
attentional dimensions. The system, hav- 
ing produced a speech act and waiting for 
a reaction of the user, expects in the first 
place a reaction corresponding exactly to 
the effect it intended to produce. If the 
user reacts differently, the system will use 
knowledge about possible types of devia- 
tion and the state of dialogue to analyze 
the nature of the deviation. 
Once a deviation has been identified, the 
system may need to modify more or less 
deeply the planned course of the dialogue: 
from local adaptation like embedding a
small clarification subdialogue (sentences 
14-15), to more global revision like re- 
ordering entire sub-topics (sentence 6). 
Hence to interpret he influence of an un- 
expected speech act at a certain point in 
the dialogue the representation f the state 
of dialogue should reflect the structure of 
the whole dialogue: keeping track of past 
exchanges and anticipating the remainder 
of the dialogue. 
3 Overview of the Dia- 
logue Manager 
The general organization of the Esteam- 
316 Dialogue System \[1\] is depicted in fig- 
ure 1. 
A Natural Language Front-End (NLF) 
transforms natural language utterances 
into literal meaning and vice-versa. The 
literal meaning corresponds to an iso- 
lated surface speech act. The Recognizer 
takes a literal meaning from the Front-End 
and determines whether the corresponding

ager 
surface act of the user could be an exam- 
ple of, or a part of, one of the commu- 
nicative actions that the system expects 
from the user in the context of the cur- 
rent dialogue. The expectations are con- 
trolled by the Planner which conducts the 
dialogue and maintains a structure of the 
system's intentions (SSI), while reacting to 
user's intentions detected by the Recog- 
nizer. The Planner interacts with the Ex- 
pression Specialists for constructing from 
the communicative acts it intends to per- 
form (what o communicate) an appropri- 
ate literal meaning (how to say it). 
An advice giving dialogue is a particular 
case of task-oriented dialogue. The task- 
level plan reflects the problem of the user. 
The advice giving system has only commu- 
nicative intentions for constructing and re- 
fining the task-level plan. A complete ad- 
vice giving session contains three phases: 
problem formulation, resolution and pre- 
sentation of the solution. In this paper, we 
concentrate on first phase. During prob- 
lem formulation, the system helps the user 
to refine, select and instantiate appropri- 
ate subplans according to the user's goals. 
The task plan is initialized by a stereo- 
typical pattern of actions which could be 
recommanded as part of a "good" solu- 
tion. The result of the problem formu- 
lation phase is a coherent task-level plan 
which can be passed to an expert problem 
the 
The communicative intentions of the sys- 
tem are stored in the Structure of System 
Intentions: the SSI reflects the state of the 
plan of dialogue from the system's point of 
view. 
4.1 Communicat ive  Leve l  P lans  
The Planner uses a hierarchical set of 
plans for constructing the SSI. Plans 
are associated with the various commu- 
nicative level intentions of the system. 
We have designed two types of plans: 
dialogue.plans and communicative-plans. 
Dialogue-P lans are the most abstract 
plans of the Planner. They express the 
strategy of the overall advice-giving ses- 
sion \[7\]. The purpose of these plans is 
to capture procedural knowledge for an 
"ideal" advice-giving session. They are 
used to initiate the SSI, but also include 
means for adaptation at execution time 
\[8\]. 
Basically the models of dialogue-plans ex- 
press dominance and sequencing relations 
among the sub-parts of the dialogue ses- 
sion (decomposition), and the part of the 
task level plan that is in focus at a given 
step of the communicative level plan (pa- 
rameter). 
Communicat ive -P lans  models

nicative intention of the system in terms

communicative acts of the user. For the 
Planner a communicative plan is seen as 
a primitive action to be be passed to the 
Expression Specialists for execution. 
4.2  Expectat ion  S tack  and  
St ructure  o f  Sys tem In ten-  
t ions  
The SSI is a tree enhanced by orderings 
relations, in which each node represents a 
communicative l vel plan of the system, 
and links decomposition relations of plans 
into subplans. In addition each node in 
the SSI is related to a given subpart of the 
task-plan. At a given point in the dialogue 
the attentional state can be represented 
by a stack in which the bottom contains 
the focus associated with the most gen- 
eral plan and the top contains the focus 
of the plan currently executed. For exam- 
ple, when the system asks for the amount 
of the emergency fund, there will be three 
focus levels in the stack: the investment 
plan at the bottom, the emergency fund 
in the middle and the amount on top (see 
figure 2). 
Using this attentional state the Recognizer 
could only analyze changes of focus. The 
problem is still to provide the Recognizer 
with expectations concerning the inten- 
tions of the user. The method of rep- 
resenting expectations i to attach a set 
user's communicative acts to each type of 
system's intentions in the SSI and to or-

ganize these expectations according to the 
attentional state. We obtain the Ezpecta- 
tion Stack. 
Let us consider an example to understand 
better the significance of the different ob- 
jects included in the Expectation Stack. 
Figure 3 represents the state of the Ex- 
pectation Stack when the system asks for 
the delay of the emergency fund (sentence 
13 or 15).  
The most expected answer is the delay of 
the emergency fund, but the system also 
foresees the possibility of a request for ex- 
planation from the user. At the next level, 
the system expects the user to speak about 
another parameter of the same plan (the 
amount). At the level still further be- 
low, he/she can speak about the emer- 
gency fund in general, he/she can for ex- 
ample refuse the emergency fund, or ask 
for explanation on it. And so on, until the 
system reaches the most unexpected reac- 
tions of the user, i.e., even things that are 
not related to the investment problem. (in 
the level "others") 
5 Dialogue Management:  
Execution and Revision 
In the previous ections, we have presented 
the different structures needed to reflect 
the state of dialogue. The aim of this part 
- 157-  
is to show how these structures are used 
for handling revisions during the execution 
of the dialogue. 
The SSI is generated by a depth-first ex- 
pansion of the abstract communicative 
goals of the system (use of dialogue-plan 
models). This process stops as soon 
as the Planner reaches an atomic action 
(communicative-plan)that produces a re- 
quest toward the user. At this point, 
the Expectation Stack is derived from the 
state of the SSI and reflects the precise 
topic of the question on top. 
The input of the user is analyzed by the 
NLF and the Recognizer \[1\] is called to 
derive the user's intentions encoded in 
the answer. The Recognizer eturns the 
speech act in the Expectation Stack it was 
able to match. In most cases, the returned 
speech act corresponds to the direct ex- 
pected answer and the dialogue continues 
without revision. 
A deviation occurs, however, when the 
Recognizer does not return the level cor- 
responding to the most expected answer, 
or when the user tries to put inconsis- 
tent value in the task plan (an example of 
such an inconsistent value is given in sen- 
tence 20). In this case, the Planner must 
use consistency constraints attached to the 
task plan. Thus, the pointer returned by 
the Recognizer in the Expectation Stack 
indicates all the changes of subject or of 
intention by the user while the constraints 
attached to parameters of the task plan 
reveal inconsistent values. 
There is a revision associated with each 
type of deviation. A revision is a struc- 
tural transformation pattern for correct- 
ing the SSI after the user's answer in order 
to continue a coherent dialogue. 
We illustrate the result of a revision on 
sentences 5 and 6 (see figure 4. 
We can see that the transformation takes 
into account a subsequent return to 
the emergency fund and an explicit re- 
introduction of this subject. 
The same types of transformation are used 
to treat the deviations caused by the re- 
quests for explanation (sentence 14). In 
the case of inconsistent values (sentence 
20), a subplan is inserted for explaining 
why the value is inconsistent and asking 
the user to change something in order to 
correct he violation (sentences 21). 
It is interesting to note here that the strat- 
egy of the dialoguer can easily be modified 
by changing either the models of the plans 
or the transformations a sociated with the 
cases of deviation. We presented above a 
strategy in the dialogue that ~follows the 
user" (i.e., the dialoguer is very cooper- 
ative and changes the subject each time 
the user wants to). For instance, when 
the user decides to speak about his/her 
car, the system is cooperative and allows 
him/her to do so. It would also have been 
possible to adopt another strategy and to 
say "ok, we will talk about your car later, 
but now we need to discuss the emergency 
fund because people tend to forget it oth- 
erwise". 
6 Conclus ion 
The adaptive planning method presented 
above takes into account both analyses of 
intentions and changes of topic. Recogni- 
tion of intentions is organized around the 
attentional state in order to delimit the 
scope of the revision. The revision mech- 
anism is currently implemented in an ex- 
perimental prototype of the ESTEAM-316 
Dialogner (written in PROLOG and run- 
ning on SUN Workstations). 
This approach seems appropriate for the 
type of dialogues where the Uexpert" ad- 
vice giving system has a quite directive
