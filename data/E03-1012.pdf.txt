1 Introduction
The beginning of the work dates back to 1998
when the authors started a research project on the
application of ILP (Inductive Logic Program-
ming) learning methods for part-of-speech tag-
ging. This research was done within the
framework of a European ESPRIT project (LTR
20237, "lLP2"), where first studies were based
on the so-called TELRI corpus (Erjavec et al.,
1998). Since the corpus annotation had several
deficiencies and its size proved to be small for
further research, a national project has been or-
ganized with the main goal to create a suitably
large training corpus for machine learning appli-
cations, primarily for POS (Part-of-speech) tag-
ging.
PUS tagging plays a central role in NLP (natu-
ral language processing). Hungarian words —
similarly to other languages — may have more
than one part-of-speech labels (e.g. the word eg
may be a noun or a verb)! In many natural lan-
guage processing software systems, including
web-based dictionaries and optical character rec-
ognition programs, determining the part-of-
kg is an ambiguous word in Hungarian, it corresponds either to sky (noun)
or to burn (verb) in English.
Abstract
Current paper presents the results of a
two-year project during which a consor-
tium of the University of Szeged and the
MorphoLogic Ltd. Budapest developed a
morpho-syntactically parsed and anno-
tated (disambiguated) corpus for Hun-
garian. For morpho-syntactic encoding,
the Hungarian version of MSD (Morpho-
Syntactic Description) has been used. The
corpus contains texts of five different
topic areas: schoolchildren's composi-
tions, fiction, computer-related texts,
news, and legal texts. During annotation,
linguists have checked the morpho-
syntactic parsing of each word. Finding
part-of-speech tagging (disambiguation)
rules by machine learning algorithms was
also studied by the researchers of the con-
sortium. Due to the fact that the size of
the corpus reaches up to 1 million text
words without punctuation characters, it
may serve as a reference source for nu-
merous future research applications. The
corpus can be obtained freely via Internet
for research and educational purposes.

speech tag of a particular word in a given context
is significant. Syntactic and semantic parsing of
natural language sentences are greatly influenced
by adequate part-of-speech tagging. In their pre-
liminary studies, the consortium members found
that ambiguous words are very frequent in Hun-
garian language. Hence, developing an annota-
tion (disambiguation) technology proved to be a
real necessity.
When choosing the form of representation of
the corpus it was taken into consideration that it
should comply with international standards.
Therefore, the tag encoding system of the anno-
tated Hungarian corpus was based on a technol-
ogy (MSD) that has already been applied to other
— mainly European — languages.
2 Preliminaries
Collecting special text corpora in Hungary has
already begun in the eighties. These texts have
been thematically grouped, but were not analyzed
morpho-syntactically. The development of the
morphological parser Humor (High-speed Unifi-
cation Morphology) began in the early nineties
(PrOszeky and Kis, 1999). In the framework of
the Copernicus project 106 "MULTEXT-EAST"
between 1995 and 1997, the participants created
an augmented morpho-syntactic coding scheme,
called MSD (Erjavec et al., 1997) to be applica-
ble to Central and East European languages. To
demonstrate the behavior of this coding tech-
nique, a parallel annotated corpus was developed
based on Orwell's novel, "1984". Part-of-speech
tagging of this corpus was completed manually
by linguists. It is widely known as TELRI corpus
and published on a CD-ROM (Erjavec et al.,
1998). For automatic generation of morpho-
syntactic labels for the Hungarian part of the
TELRI corpus the above-mentioned Humor sys-
tem was used.
Unfortunately, the Hungarian part of the
TELRI corpus did not implement the whole en-
coding scheme; more precisely, it did not classify
the pronouns, numerals, adverbs, and conjunc-
tions. For example, all pronouns got the same [P]
tag, without any attributes encoded. Other at-
tempts for making a Hungarian annotated corpus
was not known before the presently described
project was started in 2000. A comparison of the
manually annotated Hungarian corpus and the
Hungarian part of the TELRI corpus can be seen
in Table 1.

Using the TELRI corpus Horvath, Alexin,
GyimOthy, and Wrobel, (1999) investigated the
applicability of several machine learning algo-
rithms for learning part-of-speech tagging rules
for Hungarian. The manually annotated Hungar-
ian corpus can significantly enlarge the learning
database for applying similar methods.
In section 3 the main feature of the corpus is
presented, in section 4 more statistical data and
two connecting projects is presented. Section 5
summarizes the main achievements of the work.
3 Manually Annotated Hungarian Corpus
Participants of the project aimed not only to in-
crease the amount of corpus text up to 1 million
text words, but to improve the quality of the an-
notation as well. By quality we mean both full
conformity to the MSD coding scheme and accu-
rate manual morpho-syntactic parsing and tag-
ging.
The parts of the 1-million-word corpus were
selected and put together by the project partners.
Naturally, a corpus of this size could not cover
the whole written language, but the consortium
tried to mainly include most recent texts, well
representing the major types available through
the Internet, including the special language used
by the youth — the primary users of the Internet.
Based on this idea, the consortium decided to
gather texts belonging to five different topic ar-
eas listed below. Parts of the corpus belonging to
54
each topic area contains roughly 200 000 words
respectively.
•
Schoolchildren's compositions. This material
was collected from pupils of the age 16 (grade
10). They were asked to write two one-page-
long compositions with the titles The most in-
teresting day of my life and Why do/don't I like
school? This type of text caused lot of head-
aches for the consortium, because it contained
many misspelled, mistyped or incorrectly writ-
ten words — a phenomenon that occurs fre-
quently in Internet texts as well.
• Fiction. Three novels were included in the cor-
pus, one of which was the Hungarian transla-
tion of Orwell's 1984 and two more Hungarian
novels. The first has been completely re-parsed
and re-annotated.
• Computer-related texts. Some issues of Com-
puterWorld SzcimItcistechnika magazine and
three chapters from a book about Windows
2000 were selected.
• News. One complete issue each from 1999 of
four well-known Hungarian newspapers (Ma-
gyar Hirlap, Nepszabadscig, Nepszava and
HVG)
• Legal texts. Two complete Acts (Act on eco-
nomic companies, Act on authors' rights) were
included in the corpus.
The developed corpus is available in XML 2
format. The inner structure of the files is de-
scribed in TEIXLITE DTD (Document Type
Definition). 3 This "light" version of the TEI
XML DTD is widely used for corpus representa-
tions.
The text of the corpus has been divided into
divisions between <div> and </div> tags), where
one division comprised a single composition, a
newspaper article, etc.; paragraphs (marked by
<p> and </p> tags); and sentences (between <s>
and </s> tags). Each structural element is
uniquely identified by an id attribute. Text words
are marked by <w> and </w>, punctuation char-
acters marked by <c> and </c> tags. Some statis-
tical data can be seen in Table 2.
The next step of processing was morpho-
syntactic parsing. Preliminary steps were exe-
cuted by a segmenting tool and the HuMor mor-

pho-syntactic parser. A lexicon has been built
that contained all of the 163 000 different word-
forms and a 15 000-word-long list of named en-
tities, mainly proper nouns occurring in the cor-
pus. Either since HuMor could not produce some
of the attributes needed for MSD encoding or
because the results of this automatic tool were
sometimes incorrect, linguists had to manually
check the lexicon and create a relatively large list
of exceptions. Most of this work was based on
the Hungarian Explanatory Dictionary (Juhasz,
SzOke, Nagy, and Kovalovszky, 1972), however
annotators had to rely on their intuition in a large
number of neologies. Finally, the whole text was
re-parsed using the created exception dictionary.
Tags Number of tags
<div> 3365
<p> 17 144
<s> 68 932
<w> words 1 009 024
<c> punctuations 203 005
Table 2. Data exhibiting the size of the manu-
ally annotated Hungarian corpus
To make the manual annotation easier, a soft-
ware tool was written. Annotators worked on
400-500-sentence-long pieces of the corpus.
Senior linguists and computer programs checked
the quality of their work. Producing a POS tagger
prototype was among the final goals of the proj-
ect.
4 Discussion
The development of the first version of the cor-
pus was finished in summer of 2002. Since then
two major projects have been started using the
described corpus. Each of which aims to add new
features to the existing material.
The goal of the first project is to create an in-
formation extraction system from short business
news. To accomplish this, participants augment
the manually annotated Hungarian corpus with a
200 000-word-long part containing short business
news. Moreover, a newer version of the corpus is
created containing partial syntactic parsing
namely, hierarchic NP annotations. During this
project, the participants extensively use tools for
determining syntax rules and machine learning
techniques. The goal of the second project is to
55
create a complete treebank for Hungarian by the
end of 2004.
The distribution of words' main categories oc-
curring in the manually annotated Hungarian
corpus is shown in Table 3.

5 Conclusion
During 2000-2002 the consortium developed the
manually annotated Hungarian corpus as well as
a part-of-speech tagging method (prototype sys-
tem and technology), possessing the following
characteristics:
• establishment of a medium-size (1 million-
word-long) manually annotated Hungarian
learning corpus;
• efficient disambiguation of texts belonging
to different domains;
• development of an adaptable system that is
able to keep track of the changes in the
(spoken or written) language;
• a technology applicable to other European
languages;
• internationally accepted part-of-speech
(morpho-syntactic) classes, augmented with
the special attributes of Hungarian language
necessary partly because of the highly in-
flectional character of Hungarian language.
From the scientific point of view, future forth-
coming papers dealing with applications, accu-
racy, combinations, and limits of existing
learning algorithms can be of international scien-
tific interest.
