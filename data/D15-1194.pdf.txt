in Social Media Messages

Abstract
Previous studies have shown that health
reports in social media, such as Dai-
lyStrength and Twitter, have potential for
monitoring health conditions (e.g. adverse
drug reactions, infectious diseases) in par-
ticular communities. However, in order
for a machine to understand and make in-
ferences on these health conditions, the
ability to recognise when laymen’s terms
refer to a particular medical concept (i.e.
text normalisation) is required. To achieve
this, we propose to adapt an existing
phrase-based machine translation (MT)
technique and a vector representation of
words to map between a social media
phrase and a medical concept. We eval-
uate our proposed approach using a col-
lection of phrases from tweets related to
adverse drug reactions. Our experimen-
tal results show that the combination of a
phrase-based MT technique and the simi-
larity between word vector representations
outperforms the baselines that apply only
either of them by up to 55%.
1 Introduction
Social media, such as DailyStrength
1
and Twit-
ter
2
, is a fast growing and potentially rich source
of voice of the patient data about experience in
terms of benefits and side-effects of drugs and
treatments (O’Connor et al., 2014). However,
natural language understanding from social me-
dia messages is a difficult task because of the
lexical and grammatical variability of the lan-
guage (Baldwin et al., 2013; O’Connor et al.,
2014). Indeed, language understanding by ma-
chines requires the ability to recognise when a
phrase refers to a particular concept. Given a
1
http://www.dailystrength.org/
2
http://twitter.com
variable length phrase, an effective system should
return a concept with the most similar mean-
ing. Table 1 shows examples of mappings be-
tween Twitter phrases and medical concepts. For
example, a Twitter phrase ‘No way I’m gettin
any sleep 2nite’ might be mapped to the med-
ical concept ‘Insomnia’ (SNOMED:193462001),
when using the SNOMED-CT ontology (Spack-
man et al., 1997). The success of the mapping
between social media phrases and formal medi-
cal concepts would enable an automatic integra-
tion between patient experiences and biomedical
databases (Limsopatham and Collier, 2015). We
refer to this mapping from social media phrases to
medical concepts as medical term normalisation,
which aims to determine the unique identifier of
a medical concept that is mentioned in different
forms in a free-text (Morgan et al., 2008).
Existing works, e.g. (Elkin et al., 2012; Gob-
bel et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2009), mostly fo-
cused on identifying medical concepts in medi-
cal documents. For example, Gobbel et al. (2014)
proposed a na¨?ve Bayesian-based technique to
map phrases from clinical notes to medical con-
cepts in the SNOMED-CT ontology. Wang et
al. (2009) identified medical concepts regarding
adverse drug events in electronic medical records.
On the other hand, O’Connor et al. (2014) in-
vestigated the normalisation of medical terms in
Twitter messages. In particular, they proposed to
use the Lucene retrieval engine
3
to retrieve medi-
cal concepts that could be potentially mapped to
a given Twitter phrase, when mapping between
Twitter phrases and medical concepts.
In contrast, we argue that the medical text nor-
malisation task can be achieved by using well-
established phrase-based MT techniques, where
we translate a text written in a social media lan-
guage (e.g. ‘No way I’m gettin any sleep 2nite’) to
a text written in a formal medical language (e.g.

tween the translated phrase and the description of
a medical concept. Indeed, in this work we investi-
gate an effective adaptation of phrase-based MT to
map a Twitter phrase to a medical concept. More-
over, we propose to combine the adapted phrase-
based MT technique and the similarity between
word vector representations to effectively map a
Twitter phrase to a medical concept.
The main contributions of this paper are three-
fold:
1. We investigate the adaptation of phrase-based
MT to map a Twitter phrase to a SNOMED-
CT concept.
2. We propose to combine our adaptation of
phrase-based MT and the similarity between
word vector representations to map Twitter
phrases to formal medical concepts.
3. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed ap-
proach using phrases from our collection of
tweets related to the topic of adverse drug re-
actions (ADRs).
2 Related Work
Phrase-based MT models, e.g. (Koehn et al., 2003;
Och and Ney, 2004), have been shown to be effec-
tive in translation between languages, as they learn
local term dependencies, such as collocations, re-
orderings, insertions and deletions. Koehn et
al. (2003) showed that a phrase-based MT tech-
nique markedly outperformed traditional word-
based MT techniques on several benchmarks. In
this work, we adapt the phrase-based MT tech-
nique of Koehn et al. (2003) for the medical
text normalisation task. In particular, we use the
phrase-based MT technique to translate phrases
from Twitter language to formal medical lan-
guage, before mapping the translated phrases to
medical concepts based on the ranked similarity
of their word vector representations.
Traditional approaches for creating word vec-
tor representations treated words as atomic
units (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Turian et al., 2010).
For instance, the one-hot representation used a
vector with a length of the size of the vocabu-
lary, where one dimension is on, to represent a
particular word (Turian et al., 2010). Recently,
techniques for learning high-quality word vec-
tor representations (i.e. distributed word repre-
sentations) that could capture the semantic sim-
ilarity between words, such as continuous bags
of words (CBOW) (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and
global vectors (GloVe) (Pennington et al., 2014),
have been proposed. Indeed, these distributed
word representations have been effectively ap-
plied in different systems that achieve state-of-
the-art performances for several NLP tasks, such
as MT (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and named entity
recognition (Passos et al., 2014). In this work, be-
side using word vector representations to measure
the similarity between translated Twitter phrases
and the description of medical concepts, we use
the similarity between word vector representations
of the original Twitter phrase and the descrip-
tion of a medical concept to augment the adapted
phrase-based MT technique.
3 Medical Term Normalisation
We discuss our adaptation of phrase-based MT for
medical text normalisation in Section 3.1. Sec-
tion 3.2 introduces our proposed approach for
combining similarity score of word vector repre-
sentations with the adapted phrase-based MT tech-
nique.
1676
3.1 Adapting Phrase-based MT
We aim to learn a translation between a Twitter
phrase (i.e. a phrase from a Twitter message) and
a formal medical phrase (i.e. the description of a
medical concept). For a given Twitter phrase phr
t
,
we find a suitable medical phrase phr
m
using a
translation score, based on a phrase-based model,
as follows:
score
translation
(phr
m
|phr
t
) = p(phr
m
|phr
t
) (1)
where p(phr
m
|phr
t
) can be calculated using any
phrase-based MT technique, e.g. (Koehn et al.,
2003; Och and Ney, 2004). We then rank trans-
lated phrases phr
m
based on this translation score.
The top-k translated phrases are used for identify-
ing the corresponding medical concept.
However, the translated phrase phr
m
may not
be exactly matched with the description of any
target medical concepts. We propose two tech-
niques to deal with this problem. For the first
technique, we rank the target concepts based on
the cosine similarity between the vector represen-
tation of phr
m
and the vector representation of the
description of each concept desc
c
:
sim
cos
(phr
m
, desc
c
) =
V
phr
m
· V
desc
c
||V
phr
m
|| × ||V
desc
c
||
(2)
where V
phr
m
and V
desc
c
are the vector represen-
tations of phr
m
and desc
c
, respectively. Any
technique for creating word vector representations
(e.g. one-hot, CBOW and GloVe) can be used.
Note that if a phrase (e.g. phr
m
) contains several
terms, we create a vector representation by sum-
ming the value of the same dimension of the vec-
tor representation of each word (i.e. element-wise
addition).
On the other hand, the second technique also
incorporates the ranked position r of the trans-
lated phrase phr
m
when translated from the orig-
inal phrase phr
t
using Equation (1). Indeed, the
second technique calculates the similarity score as
follows:
sim
rcos
(phr
m
, desc
c
) =
1
r
·
V
phr
m
· V
desc
c
||V
phr
m
|| × ||V
desc
c
||
(3)
3.2 Combining Similarity Score with
Phrase-based MT
As discussed in Section 2, word vector represen-
tations (e.g. created by CBOW or GloVe) can cap-
ture semantic similarity between words by itself.
Hence, we propose to map a Twitter phrase phr
t
to a medical concept c, which is represented with
a description desc
c
, by linearly combining the co-
sine similarity, between vector representations of
the Twitter phrase phr
t
and the description desc
c
,
with the similarity score computed using one of
the adapted phrased-based MT techniques (intro-
duced in Section 3.1), as follows:
sim
combine
(phr
t
, desc
c
) =
V
phr
t
· V
desc
c
||V
phr
t
|| × ||V
desc
c
||
(4)
+ MT
a
(phr
t
, desc
c
)
where MT
a
(phr
t
, desc
c
) is calculated using one
of the adapted phrase-based MT techniques de-
scribed in Section 3.1.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Test Collection
4
To evaluate our approach, we use a collection of
25 million tweets related to adverse drug reac-
tions (ADRs), from cognitive enhancers (Hanson
et al., 2013) and anti-depressants (Schneeweiss et
al., 2010). These tweets were collected using the
Twitter Streaming API
5
by filtering on the name
of a particular set of drugs that can have adverse
reactions to the patients. Note that terms regard-
ing adverse drug reaction (e.g. insomnia) were
not used for capturing tweets. From this collec-
tion, we use 201 ADR phrases and their corre-
sponding SNOMED-CT concepts annotated by a
PhD-level computational linguist. These phrases
were anonymised by replacing numbers, user IDs,
URIs, locations, email addresses, dates and drug
names with appropriate tokens e.g. NUMBER .
4.2 Evaluation Approach
We conduct experiments using 10-fold cross val-
idation, where the Twitter phrases are randomly
divided into 10 separated folds. We address this
task as a ranking task, where we aim to rank the
medical concept with the highest similarity score,
e.g. calculated using Equation (2), at the top rank.
Hence, we evaluate our approach using Mean Re-
ciprocal Rank (MRR) measure (Craswell, 2009),
which is an information retrieval measure based
on the user model where the user wants to see
4
The gold-standard mapping between the Twitter phrases
and the SNOMED-CT concepts are available on Zenodo.org
(DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.27354)

public
1677
only one relevant concept. In particular, MRR is
based on the the reciprocal of the rank at which
the first relevant concept is viewed in the rank-
ing (e.g. MRR = 0.5 if the first mapped concept
is wrong but the second is correct). We limit our
evaluation at top 5 of the ranking (i.e. MRR-5). In
addition, we compare the significant difference be-
tween the performance achieved by our proposed
approach and the baselines using the paired t-test
(p < 0.05).
4.3 Word Vector Representation
We use three different techniques, including one-
hot, CBOW and GloVe, to create word vector
representations used in our approach (see Sec-
tion 3). In particular, the vocabulary for creating
the one-hot representation includes all terms in the
Twitter phrases and the descriptions of the target
SNOMED-CT concepts. Meanwhile, we create
word vector representations based on CBOW and
GloVe by using the word2vec
6
and GloVe
7
imple-
mentations. We learn the vector representations
from the collections of tweets and medical arti-
cles, respectively, using window size of 10 words.
The tweet collection (denoted Twitter) contains
419,702,147 English tweets, which are related to
11 drug names and 6 cities, while the medical ar-
ticle collection (denoted BMC) includes all med-
ical articles from the BioMed Central
8
. For both
CBOW and GloVe, we create vector representa-
tions with vector sizes 50 and 200, respectively.
4.4 Learning Phrase-based Model
We use the phrase-based MT technique of Koehn
et al. (2003), as implemented in the Moses
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)
9
with default settings,
to learn to translate from the Twitter language to
the medical language. In particular, when train-
ing the translator, we show the learner pairs of
the Twitter phrases and descriptions of the corre-
sponding SNOMED-CT concepts.
5 Experimental Results
We evaluate 6 different instantiations of the pro-
posed approach discussed in Section 3, including:

1. bestMT: set k = 1, when finding the trans-
lated phrase phr
m
for a Twitter phrase phr
t
(Equation (1)), before ranking target medical
concepts for the translated phrase phr
m
using
Equation (2).
2. top5MT: similar to bestMT, but set k = 5.
3. top5MTr: similar to top5MT, but also con-
sider the rank position of the translate phrases
when ranking the target medical concepts by
using Equation (3).
4. bestMT+vSim: incorporate with the ranking
generated from bestMT, the cosine similar-
ity between the vector representations of the
Twitter phrase phr
t
and the description desc
c
of target medical concepts by using Equa-
tion (4).
5. top5MT+vSim: similar to bestMT+vSim, but
use the ranking from top5MT.
6. top5MTr+vSim: similar to bestMT+vSim, but
use the ranking from top5MTr.
Another baseline is vSim, where we consider only
the cosine similarity between the vector represen-
tations of the Twitter phrase phr
t
and the descrip-
tion desc
c
of target medical concepts.
Table 2 compares the performance of these 6
instantiations and the vSim baseline in terms of
MRR-5. We firstly observe that for the vSim base-
line, excepting for word vector representation with
vector size 50 learned using GloVe from the Twit-
ter collection, word vector representations learned
using either CBOW or GloVe are more effective
than the one-hot representation. However, the dif-
ference between the MRR-5 performance is not
statistically significant (p > 0.05, paired t-test). In
addition, word vector representations learned ei-
ther using CBOW or GloVe with vector size 200
is more effective than those with vector size 50.
Next, we find that our adaptation of phrase-
based MT (i.e. bestMT, top5MT and top5MTr) sig-
nificantly (p < 0.05) outperforms the vSim base-
line. For example, with the one-hot representation,
top5MT (MRR-5 0.2491) and top5MTr (MRR-5
0.2458) perform significantly (p < 0.05) better
than vSim (MRR-5 0.1675) by up to 49%. Mean-
while, when using word vector representations
with the vector size 200 learned using GloVe from
the BMC collection, top5MT (MRR-5 0.2638) sig-
nificantly (p < 0.05) outperforms vSim with either
the GloVe vector representation (MRR-5 0.1869)
or the one-hot representation (MRR-5 0.1675).
We observe the similar trends in performance

0.05) compared to the cosine similarity (vSim) baselines with the one-hot representation, and with the
corresponding distributed word representation (e.g. CBOW or GloVe) are denoted
4
and

, respectively.

when using vector representations learned from
the Twitter collection. These results show that our
adapted phrase-based MT techniques are effective
for the medical term normalisation task.
In addition, we observe the effectiveness
of our combined approach (i.e. bestMT+vSim,
top5MT+vSim and top5MTr+vSim), as it further
improves the performance of the adapted phrase-
based MT (i.e. bestMT, top5MT and top5MTr, re-
spectively), when using the one-hot representa-
tion. For example, top5MTr+vSim achieves the
MRR-5 of 0.2594, while the MRR-5 of top5MTr
is 0.2458. However, the performance difference is
not statistically significant. Meanwhile, when us-
ing the CBOW and GloVe vectors, the achieved
performance is varied based on the collection (i.e.
BMC or Twitter) used for learning the vectors and
the size of the vectors.
6 Conclusions
We have introduced our approach that adapts a
phrase-based MT technique to normalise medical
terms in Twitter messages. We evaluate our pro-
posed approach using a collection of phrases from
tweets related to ADRs. Our experimental results
show that the proposed approach significantly out-
performs an effective baseline by up to 55%. For
future work, we aim to investigate the modelling
of learned vector representation, such as CBOW
and GloVe, within a phrase-based MT model when
normalising medical terms.
