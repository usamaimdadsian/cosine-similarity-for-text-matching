Abstract
We construct multi-modal concept repre-
sentations by concatenating a skip-gram
linguistic representation vector with a vi-
sual concept representation vector com-
puted using the feature extraction layers
of a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) trained on a large labeled object
recognition dataset. This transfer learn-
ing approach brings a clear performance
gain over features based on the traditional
bag-of-visual-word approach. Experimen-
tal results are reported on the WordSim353
and MEN semantic relatedness evaluation
tasks. We use visual features computed us-
ing either ImageNet or ESP Game images.
1 Introduction
Recent works have shown that multi-modal se-
mantic representation models outperform uni-
modal linguistic models on a variety of tasks, in-
cluding modeling semantic relatedness and pre-
dicting compositionality (Feng and Lapata, 2010;
Leong and Mihalcea, 2011; Bruni et al., 2012;
Roller and Schulte im Walde, 2013; Kiela et al.,
2014). These results were obtained by combin-
ing linguistic feature representations with robust
visual features extracted from a set of images as-
sociated with the concept in question. This extrac-
tion of visual features usually follows the popular
computer vision approach consisting of comput-
ing local features, such as SIFT features (Lowe,
1999), and aggregating them as bags of visual
words (Sivic and Zisserman, 2003).
Meanwhile, deep transfer learning techniques
have gained considerable attention in the com-
puter vision community. First, a deep convolu-
tional neural network (CNN) is trained on a large
?

labeled dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). The
convolutional layers are then used as mid-level
feature extractors on a variety of computer vi-
sion tasks (Oquab et al., 2014; Girshick et al.,
2013; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Donahue et al.,
2014). Although transferring convolutional net-
work features is not a new idea (Driancourt and
Bottou, 1990), the simultaneous availability of
large datasets and cheap GPU co-processors has
contributed to the achievement of considerable
performance gains on a variety computer vision
benchmarks: “SIFT and HOG descriptors pro-
duced big performance gains a decade ago, and
now deep convolutional features are providing a
similar breakthrough” (Razavian et al., 2014).
This work reports on results obtained by using
CNN-extracted features in multi-modal semantic
representation models. These results are interest-
ing in several respects. First, these superior fea-
tures provide the opportunity to increase the per-
formance gap achieved by augmenting linguistic
features with multi-modal features. Second, this
increased performance confirms that the multi-
modal performance improvement results from the
information contained in the images and not the
information used to select which images to use
to represent a concept. Third, our evaluation re-
veals an intriguing property of the CNN-extracted
features. Finally, since we use the skip-gram ap-
proach of Mikolov et al. (2013) to generate our
linguistic features, we believe that this work rep-
resents the first approach to multimodal distribu-
tional semantics that exclusively relies on deep
learning for both its linguistic and visual compo-
nents.
2 Related work
2.1 Multi-Modal Distributional Semantics
Multi-modal models are motivated by parallels
with human concept acquisition. Standard se-
36
mantic space models extract meanings solely from
linguistic data, even though we know that hu-
man semantic knowledge relies heavily on percep-
tual information (Louwerse, 2011). That is, there
exists substantial evidence that many concepts
are grounded in the perceptual system (Barsalou,
2008). One way to do this grounding in the context
of distributional semantics is to obtain represen-
tations that combine information from linguistic
corpora with information from another modality,
obtained from e.g. property norming experiments
(Silberer and Lapata, 2012; Roller and Schulte im
Walde, 2013) or from processing and extracting
features from images (Feng and Lapata, 2010;
Leong and Mihalcea, 2011; Bruni et al., 2012).
This approach has met with quite some success
(Bruni et al., 2014).
2.2 Multi-modal Deep Learning
Other examples that apply multi-modal deep
learning use restricted Boltzmann machines (Sri-
vastava and Salakhutdinov, 2012; Feng et al.,
2013), auto-encoders (Wu et al., 2013) or recur-
sive neural networks (Socher et al., 2014). Multi-
modal models with deep learning components
have also successfully been employed in cross-
modal tasks (Lazaridou et al., 2014). Work that is
closely related in spirit to ours is by Silberer and
Lapata (2014). They use a stacked auto-encoder
to learn combined embeddings of textual and vi-
sual input. Their visual inputs consist of vectors
of visual attributes obtained from learning SVM
classifiers on attribute prediction tasks. In con-
trast, our work keeps the modalities separate and
follows the standard multi-modal approach of con-
catenating linguistic and visual representations in
a single semantic space model. This has the advan-
tage that it allows for separate data sources for the
individual modalities. We also learn visual repre-
sentations directly from the images (i.e., we apply
deep learning directly to the images), as opposed
to taking a higher-level representation as a start-
ing point. Frome et al. (2013) jointly learn multi-
modal representations as well, but apply them to
a visual object recognition task instead of concept
meaning.
2.3 Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
A flurry of recent results indicates that image de-
scriptors extracted from deep convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNNs) are very powerful and con-
sistently outperform highly tuned state-of-the-art
systems on a variety of visual recognition tasks
(Razavian et al., 2014). Embeddings from state-
of-the-art CNNs (such as Krizhevsky et al. (2012))
have been applied successfully to a number of
problems in computer vision (Girshick et al.,
2013; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Donahue et al.,
2014). This contribution follows the approach de-
scribed by Oquab et al. (2014): they train a CNN
on 1512 ImageNet synsets (Deng et al., 2009),
use the first seven layers of the trained network as
feature extractors on the Pascal VOC dataset, and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal
VOC classification task.
3 Improving Multi-Modal
Representations
Figure 1 illustrates how our system computes
multi-modal semantic representations.
3.1 Perceptual Representations
The perceptual component of standard multi-
modal models that rely on visual data is often
an instance of the bag-of-visual-words (BOVW)
representation (Sivic and Zisserman, 2003). This
approach takes a collection of images associated
with words or tags representing the concept in
question. For each image, keypoints are laid out
as a dense grid. Each keypoint is represented by
a vector of robust local visual features such as
SIFT (Lowe, 1999), SURF (Bay et al., 2008) and
HOG (Dalal and Triggs, 2005), as well as pyra-
midal variants of these descriptors such as PHOW
(Bosch et al., 2007). These descriptors are sub-
sequently clustered into a discrete set of “visual
words” using a standard clustering algorithm like
k-means and quantized into vector representations
by comparing the local descriptors with the cluster
centroids. Visual representations are obtained by
taking the average of the BOVW vectors for the
images that correspond to a given word. We use
BOVW as a baseline.
Our approach similarly makes use of a collec-
tion of images associated with words or tags rep-
resenting a particular concept. Each image is pro-
cessed by the first seven layers of the convolu-
tional network defined by Krizhevsky et al. (2012)
and adapted by Oquab et al. (2014)

layer produces a vector of 1512 scores associated
with 1000 categories of the ILSVRC-2012 chal-
lenge and the 512 additional categories selected by
Oquab et al. (2014). This network was trained us-
ing about 1.6 million ImageNet images associated
with these 1512 categories. We then freeze the
trained parameters, chop the last network layer,
and use the remaining seventh layer as a filter to
compute a 6144-dimensional feature vector on ar-
bitrary 224× 224 input images.
We consider two ways to aggregate the feature
vectors representing each image.
1. The first method (CNN-Mean) simply com-
putes the average of all feature vectors.
2. The second method (CNN-Max) computes
the component-wise maximum of all feature
vectors. This approach makes sense because
the feature vectors extracted from this par-
ticular network are quite sparse (about 22%
non-zero coefficients) and can be interpreted
as bags of visual properties.
3.2 Linguistic representations
For our linguistic representations we extract 100-
dimensional continuous vector representations us-
ing the log-linear skip-gram model of Mikolov
et al. (2013) trained on a corpus consisting of
the 400M word Text8 corpus of Wikipedia text
2
together with the 100M word British National
Corpus (Leech et al., 1994). We also experi-
mented with dependency-based skip-grams (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014) but this did not improve re-
sults. The skip-gram model learns high quality se-
mantic representations based on the distributional
properties of words in text, and outperforms stan-
dard distributional models on a variety of semantic
similarity and relatedness tasks. However we note
that Bruni et al. (2014) have recently reported an
even better performance for their linguistic com-
ponent using a standard distributional model, al-
though this may have been tuned to the task.
3.3 Multi-modal Representations
Following Bruni et al. (2014), we construct multi-
modal semantic representations by concatenating
the centered and L

ceptual feature vectors ~v

4 Experimental Setup
We carried out experiments using visual repre-
sentations computed using two canonical image
datasets. The resulting multi-modal concept rep-
resentations were evaluated using two well-known
semantic relatedness datasets.
4.1 Visual Data
We carried out experiments using two distinct
sources of images to compute the visual represen-
tations.
The ImageNet dataset (Deng et al., 2009) is
a large-scale ontology of images organized ac-
cording to the hierarchy of WordNet (Fellbaum,
1999). The dataset was constructed by manually
re-labelling candidate images collected using web
searches for each WordNet synset. The images
tend to be of high quality with the designated ob-
ject roughly centered in the image. Our copy of
ImageNet contains about 12.5 million images or-
ganized in 22K synsets. This implies that Ima-
geNet covers only a small fraction of the existing
117K WordNet synsets.
The ESP Game dataset (Von Ahn and Dabbish,
2004) was famously collected as a “game with
a purpose”, in which two players must indepen-
dently and rapidly agree on a correct word label
for randomly selected images. Once a word label
has been used sufficiently frequently for a given
image, that word is added to the image’s tags. This
dataset contains 100K images, but with every im-
age having on average 14 tags, that amounts to a
coverage of 20,515 words. Since players are en-
couraged to produce as many terms per image, the
dataset’s increased coverage is at the expense of
accuracy in the word-to-image mapping: a dog in
a field with a house in the background might be a
golden retriever in ImageNet and could have tags
dog, golden retriever, grass, field, house, door in
the ESP Dataset. In other words, images in the
ESP dataset do not make a distinction between ob-
jects in the foreground and in the background, or
between the relative size of the objects (tags for
images are provided in a random order, so the top
tag is not necessarily the best one).
Figures 2 and 3 show typical examples of im-
ages belonging to these datasets. Both datasets
have attractive properties. On the one hand, Ima-
geNet has higher quality images with better labels.
On the other hand, the ESP dataset has an interest-
ing coverage because the MEN task (see section
4.4) was specifically designed to be covered by the
ESP dataset.
4.2 Image Selection
Since ImageNet follows the WordNet hierarchy,
we would have to include almost all images in
the dataset to obtain representations for high-level
concepts such as entity, object and animal. Doing
so is both computationally expensive and unlikely
to improve the results. For this reason, we ran-
domly sample up to N distinct images from the
subtree associated with each concept. When this
returns less thanN images, we attempt to increase
coverage by sampling images from the subtree of
the concept’s hypernym instead. In order to allow
for a fair comparison, we apply the same method
of sampling up to N on the ESP Game dataset. In
all following experiments, N = 1.000. We used
the WordNet lemmatizer from NLTK (Bird et al.,
2009) to lemmatize tags and concept words so as
to further improve the dataset’s coverage.
4.3 Image Processing
The ImageNet images were preprocessed as de-
scribed by (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). The largest
centered square contained in each image is resam-
39
pled to form a 256 × 256 image. The CNN input
is then formed by cropping 16 pixels off each bor-
der and subtracting 128 to the image components.
The ESP Game images were preprocessed slightly
differently because we do not expect the objects
to be centered. Each image was rescaled to fit in-
side a 224×224 rectangle. The CNN input is then
formed by centering this image into the 224× 224
input field, subtracting 128 to the image compo-
nents, and zero padding.
The BOVW features were obtained by comput-
ing DSIFT descriptors using VLFeat (Vedaldi and
Fulkerson, 2008). These descriptors were subse-
quently clustered using mini-batch k-means (Scul-
ley, 2010) with 100 clusters. Each image is then
represented by a bag of clusters (visual words)
quantized as a 100-dimensional feature vector.
These vectors were then combined into visual con-
cept representations by taking their mean.
4.4 Evaluation
We evaluate our multi-modal word representations
using two semantic relatedness datasets widely
used in distributional semantics (Agirre et al.,
2009; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni et al., 2012;
Kiela and Clark, 2014; Bruni et al., 2014).
WordSim353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) is a se-
lection of 353 concept pairs with a similarity rat-
ing provided by human annotators. Since this is
probably the most widely used evaluation dataset
for distributional semantics, we include it for com-
parison with other approaches. WordSim353 has
some known idiosyncracies: it includes named en-
tities, such as OPEC, Arafat, and Maradona, as
well as abstract words, such as antecedent and
credibility, for which it may be hard to find cor-
responding images. Multi-modal representations
are often evaluated on an unspecified subset of
WordSim353 (Feng and Lapata, 2010; Bruni et
al., 2012; Bruni et al., 2014), making it impossi-
ble to compare the reported scores. In this work,
we report scores on the full WordSim353 dataset
(W353) by setting the visual vector ~v
vis
to zero for
concepts without images. We also report scores
on the subset (W353-Relevant) of pairs for which
both concepts have both ImageNet and ESP Game
images using the aforementioned selection proce-
dure.
MEN (Bruni et al., 2012) was in part designed
to alleviate the WordSim353 problems. It was con-
structed in such a way that only frequent words
with at least 50 images in the ESP Game dataset
were included in the evaluation pairs. The MEN
dataset has been found to mirror the aggregate
score over a variety of tasks and similarity datasets
(Kiela and Clark, 2014). It is also much larger,
with 3000 words pairs consisting of 751 individual
words. Although MEN was constructed so as to
have at least a minimum amount of images avail-
able in the ESP Game dataset for each concept,
this is not the case for ImageNet. Hence, simi-
larly to WordSim353, we also evaluate on a subset
(MEN-Relevant) for which images are available
in both datasets.
We evaluate the models in terms of their Spear-
man ? correlation with the human relatedness rat-
ings. The similarity between the representations
associated with a pair of words is calculated using
the cosine similarity:

5 Results
We evaluate on the two semantic relatedness
datasets using solely linguistic, solely visual and
multi-modal representations. In the case of MEN-
Relevant and W353-Relevant, we report scores for
BOVW, CNN-Mean and CNN-Max visual repre-
sentations. For all datasets we report the scores
obtained by BOVW, CNN-Mean and CNN-Max
multi-modal representations. Since we have full
coverage with the ESP Game dataset on MEN, we
are able to report visual representation scores for
the entire dataset as well. The results can be seen
in Table 1.
There are a number of questions to ask. First
of all, do CNNs yield better visual representa-
tions? Second, do CNNs yield better multi-modal
representations? And third, is there a difference
between the high-quality low-coverage ImageNet
and the low-quality higher-coverage ESP Game
dataset representations?
5.1 Visual Representations
In all cases, CNN-generated visual representations
perform better or as good as BOVW representa-
tions (we report results for BOVW-Mean, which
performs slightly better than taking the element-
wise maximum). This confirms the motivation
outlined in the introduction: by applying state-of-
the-art approaches from computer vision to multi-
modal semantics, we obtain a signficant perfor-

mance increase over standard multi-modal mod-
els.
5.2 Multi-modal Representations
Higher-quality perceptual input leads to better-
performing multi-modal representations. In all
cases multi-modal models with CNNs outperform
multi-modal models with BOVW, occasionally by
quite a margin. In all cases, multi-modal rep-
resentations outperform purely linguistic vectors
that were obtained using a state-of-the-art system.
This re-affirms the importance of multi-modal rep-
resentations for distributional semantics.
5.3 The Contribution of Images
Since the ESP Game images come with a multi-
tude of word labels, one could question whether
a performance increase of multi-modal models
based on that dataset comes from the images them-
selves, or from overlapping word labels. It might
also be possible that similar concepts are more
likely to occur in the same image, which encodes
relatedness information without necessarily tak-
ing the image data itself into account. In short,
it is a natural question to ask whether the perfor-
mance gain is due to image data or due to word
label associations? We conclusively show that the
image data matters in two ways: (a) using a dif-
ferent dataset (ImageNet) also results in a perfor-
mance boost, and (b) using higher-quality image
features on the ESP game images increases the
performance boost without changing the associa-
tion between word labels.
5.4 Image Datasets
It is important to ask whether the source im-
age dataset has a large impact on performance.
Although the scores for the visual representa-
tion in some cases differ, performance of multi-
modal representations remains close for both im-
age datasets. This implies that our method is ro-
bust over different datasets. It also suggests that it
is beneficial to train on high-quality datasets like
ImageNet and to subsequently generate embed-
dings for other sets of images like the ESP Game
dataset that are more noisy but have better cover-
age. The results show the benefit of transfering
convolutional network features, corroborating re-
cent results in computer vision.
5.5 Semantic Similarity/Relatedness Datasets
There is an interesting discrepancy between the
two types of network with respect to dataset per-
formance: CNN-Mean multi-modal models tend
to perform best on MEN and MEN-Relevant,
while CNN-Max multi-modal models perform
better on W353 and W353-Relevant. There also
appears to be some interplay between the source
corpus, the evaluation dataset and the best per-
forming CNN: the performance leap on W353-
41
Figure 4: Varying the ? parameter for MEN, MEN-Relevant, WordSim353 and WordSim353-Relevant,
respectively.
Relevant for CNN-Max is much larger using ESP
Game images than with ImageNet images.
We speculate that this is because CNN-Max per-
forms better than CNN-Mean on a somewhat dif-
ferent type of similarity. It has been noted (Agirre
et al., 2009) that WordSim353 captures both sim-
ilarity (as in tiger-cat, with a score of 7.35) as
well as relatedness (as in Maradona-football, with
a score of 8.62). MEN, however, is explicitly de-
signed to capture semantic relatedness only (Bruni
et al., 2012). CNN-Max using sparse feature vec-
tors means that we treat the dominant components
as definitive of the concept class, which is more
suited to similarity. CNN-Mean averages over
all the feature components, and as such might be
more suited to relatedness. We conjecture that the
performance increase on WordSim353 is due to
increased performance on the similarity subset of
that dataset.
5.6 Tuning
The concatenation scheme in Equation 1 allows
for a tuning parameter ? to weight the relative
contribution of the respective modalities. Previous
work on MEN has found that the optimal param-
eter for that dataset is close to 0.5 (Bruni et al.,
2014). We have found that this is indeed the case.
On WordSim353, however, we have found the pa-
rameter for optimal performance to be shifted to
the right, meaning that optimal performance is
achieved when we include less of the visual input
compared to the linguistic input. Figure 4 shows
what happens when we vary alpha over the four
datasets. There are a number of observations to be
made here.
First of all, we can see that the performance
peak for the MEN datastes is much higher than
for the WordSim353 ones, and that its peak is rel-
atively higher as well. This indicates that MEN is
in a sense a more balanced dataset. There are two
possible explanations: as indicated earlier, Word-
Sim353 contains slightly idiosyncratic word pairs
which may have a detrimental effect on perfor-
mance; or, WordSim353 was not constructed with
multi-modal semantics in mind, and contains a
substantial amount of abstract words that would
not benefit at all from including visual informa-
tion.
Due to the nature of the datasets and the tasks
at hand, it is arguably much more important that
CNNs beat standard bag-of-visual-words repre-
sentations on MEN than on W353, and indeed we
see that there exists no ? for which BOVW would
beat any of the CNN networks.

Table 2: The top 5 best and top 5 worst scoring pairs with respect to the gold standard.
Mean multi-modal vectors. The most accurate
pairs are consistently the same across the two im-
age datasets. There are some clear differences
between the least accurate pairs, however. The
MEN words potatoes and tomato probably have
low quality ImageNet-derived representations, be-
cause they occur often in the bottom pairs for that
dataset. The MEN words dessert, bread and fruit
occur in the bottom 5 for both image datasets,
which implies that their linguistic representations
are probably not very good. For WordSim353, the
bottom pairs on ImageNet could be said to be sim-
ilarity mistakes; while the ESP Game dataset con-
tains more relatedness mistakes (king and queen
would evaluate similarity, while stock and market
would evaluate relatedness). It is difficult to say
anything conclusive about this discrepancy, but it
is clearly a direction for future research.
7 Image embeddings
To facilitate further research on image embed-
dings and multi-modal semantics, we publicly re-
lease embeddings for all the image labels occur-
ring in the ESP Game dataset. Please see the fol-
lowing web page: http://www.cl.cam.ac.

8 Conclusion
We presented a novel approach to improving
multi-modal representations using deep convo-
lutional neural network-extracted features. We
reported high results on two well-known and
widely-used semantic relatedness benchmarks,
with increased performance both in the separate
visual representations and in the combined multi-
modal representations. Our results indicate that
such multi-modal representations outperform both
linguistic and standard bag-of-visual-words multi-
modal representations. We have shown that our
approach is robust and that CNN-extracted fea-
tures from separate image datasets can succesfully
be applied to semantic relatedness.
In addition to improving multi-modal represen-
tations, we have shown that the source of this im-
provement is due to image data and is not simply a
result of word label associations. We have shown
this by obtaining performance improvements on
two different image datasets, and by obtaining
43
higher performance with higher-quality image fea-
tures on the ESP game images, without changing
the association between word labels.
In future work, we will investigate whether our
system can be further improved by including con-
creteness information or a substitute metric such
as image dispersion, as has been suggested by
other work on multi-modal semantics (Kiela et al.,
2014). Furthermore, a logical next step to increase
performance would be to jointly learn multi-modal
representations or to learn weighting parameters.
Another interesting possibility would be to exam-
ine multi-modal distributional compositional se-
mantics, where multi-modal representations are
composed to obtain phrasal representations.
