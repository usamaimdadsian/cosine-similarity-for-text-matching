Abstract
We introduce pre-post-editing, possibly
the most basic form of interactive trans-
lation, as a touch-based interaction with
iteratively improved translation hypothe-
ses prior to classical post-editing. We re-
port simulated experiments that yield very
large improvements on classical evalua-
tion metrics (up to 21 BLEU) as well as
on a parameterized variant of the TER
metric that takes into account the cost of
matching/touching tokens, confirming the
promising prospects of the novel transla-
tion scenarios offered by our approach.
1 Introduction
As shown by oracle studies (Wisniewski et al.,
2010; Turchi et al., 2012; Marie and Max, 2013),
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems
produce results that are of significantly lower qual-
ity than what could be produced from their avail-
able resources. As a pragmatic solution, human
intervention is commonly used for improving au-
tomatic draft translations, in so-called post-editing
(PE), but is also studied earlier in the translation
process in a variety of interactive strategies, in-
cluding e.g. completion assistance and local trans-
lation choices (e.g. (Foster et al., 2002; Koehn and
Haddow, 2009; Gonz´alez-Rubio et al., 2013)). Al-
though interactive machine translation does facil-
itate the work of the SMT system in certain situa-
tions by allowing it to make efficient use of knowl-
edge contributed by the human translator, post-
editing has been shown to remain a faster alter-
native (Green et al., 2014). Nevertheless, this ac-
tivity usually requires complex intervention from
an expert translator (Carl et al., 2011).
In this work we reduce interaction with an SMT
system to its most basic form: similarly to what a
human translator is likely to do when first reading
a draft translation to post-edit, we require a user
to simply spot those segments of a draft transla-
tion that can participate in an acceptable transla-
tion. The corresponding information is then used
by a SMT system in a soft way to improve the
draft translation. This process may be iteratively
repeated as long as enough improvements are ob-
tained, and terminates with classical post-editing
on the obtained translation, hence we dub it pre-
post-editing (PPE). We resort to simulated pre-
post-editing and post-editing, as in other works
(Carl et al., 2011; Denkowski et al., 2014), to
measure translation performance on some avail-
able reference translation using both classical met-
rics and a variant of the TER metric (Snover et
al., 2006), where, essentially, the cost of a token
matching operation is a parameterized fraction of
the cost of the other token edit operations. With
the implementation of appropriate strategies in the
SMT system, we show under reasonable assump-
tions that this approach has the potential to signifi-
cantly reduce the amount of human effort required
to obtain a final translation.
In the remainder of this article, we describe the
technical details of pre-post-editing (Section 2),
report experiments conducted on two translation
directions and two domains (Section 3), and fi-
nally discuss our proposal and introduce our future
work (Section 4).
2 Touch-based pre-post-editing
In our PPE framework, the human pre-post-editor
has to mark n-grams from a translation hypoth-
esis that can take part in a correct translation.
1
The annotated n-grams are counted, as an n-gram
can appear more than once in the same sentence,
and a “positive” 6-gram language model (LM)
1
A touch-based interface when a keyboard is not available
or typing is inconvenient lends itself particularly well to PPE.
1040
(positive-lm) is trained on these counts
2
. A
“negative” LM (negative-lm) is also trained
on the counted n-grams left unannotated. Then,
all bi-phrases from the SMT system’s phrase ta-
ble that match an annotated n-gram, according to
the source token alignments provided by the de-
coder, are removed from the main phrase table
and stored in a separate “positive” phrase table
(positive-pt). Conversely, n-grams contain-
ing at least one token left unannotated are consid-
ered as incorrect, and the set of bi-phrases match-
ing these n-grams are removed and stored in a
“negative” phrase table (negative-pt).
As source tokens can appear more than once in a
source text, they are located: an identifier is con-
catenated to each token to make it unique in the
source text. Tokens of the source phrases in the
phrase table are accordingly also located, so each
bi-phrase is duplicated as needed to cover all lo-
cated tokens. Using located tokens allows our PPE
framework to treat differently source tokens that
are correctly translated from incorrectly translated
ones in the same sentence or text. Figure 1 shows
an example of phrase table extraction, using lo-
cated source tokens
3
, for one iteration of PPE.
If an n-gram is annotated as correct, all its in-
ner n-grams of lower order are also deemed cor-
rect. Although annotating translations of high
quality may be less expensive by explicitely anno-
tating incorrect n-grams instead of correct ones,
such annotations would not permit to identify cor-
rect n-grams inside incorrect ones, as illustrated
in Figure 2. PPE can thus be worded as a simple
problem for the pre-post-editor: which sequences
of tokens should appear in the final translation?
The newly extracted phrase tables and LMs
4
,
along with the remainder of the original phrase
table and the original LM, are used to re-decode
the source text in a first iteration of PPE. A new
PPE annotation can then be performed on the new
translations. The newly extracted “positive” and
“negative” phrase tables are merged with the cor-
responding phrase table of the previous iteration.
The extracted n-gram counts from the current iter-
ation and the counts of the previous iterations are
summed, and the LMs are re-trained with the up-
dated counts. A new iteration of PPE is then per-
2
We used SRILM (Stolcke, 2002) to train the LMs with
Witten-Bell smoothing.

Subsequent examples do not use located tokens.

The extracted LMs are sentence-level, and are only used
on their specific sentence during PPE.

3 Experiments
3.1 Data and systems
We ran experiments on two translation tasks of
different domains: the WMT’14 Medical trans-
lation task (medical) and the WMT’11 news
translation task (news) for the language pair en-fr
on both translation directions. For both tasks we
trained two competitive phrase-based SMT sys-
tems using Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and WMT
data
6
(see Table 1). The tuning for all systems,
including our iteration-specific PPE systems, was
performed with kb-mira (Cherry and Foster,
2012).

Classical MT evaluation metrics cannot take into
account the interactive cost of PPE, and thus do

not allow us to make direct comparisons with PE.
We thus adapt the TER (Snover et al., 2006)
metric, which typically uses 4 types of token
edits: substitution (s), insertion (i),
deletion (d) and shift (f ). While these edit
types all have a (debatable) uniform cost of 1, the
operation of matching (m) a correct token is ig-
nored. We posit that this operation is in fact per-
formed by a human translator during PE (at the
minimum, by recognizing and skipping tokens),
and that it can be directly compared to our touch-
based selection of tokens for PPE. However, we
cannot at this stage of our work provide a realistic
cost value for this operation, and so we introduce
a match cost parameter ?, and use the following
as our PPE-aware metric:
TER
PPE
=
#s+#d+#i+#f + ?#m
r + ?r
(1)
where r is the number of tokens in the reference
translation. Note that a null value for ? makes
TER
PPE
correspond to TER, while a value of 1
would indicate that a token matching/touch (m)
is e.g. as costly as a token rewriting (s). We antic-
ipate that a realistic value for ? given a reasonably
skilled user should be rather small, but we will
provide TER
PPE
results for the full range [0, 1].
3.3 Experimental results
To validate our approach, we initially used a sim-
ulated post-editing paradigm (Carl et al., 2011;
Denkowski et al., 2014) in which non-post-edited
reference translations are used in lieu of human
post-editions. Results on TER (Snover et al.,
2006) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), tuning
on both metrics, are provided in Tables 2 (news)
and 3 (medical).
First, we observe that whatever the metric and
the task, the first iteration of PPE always yields
a significant improvement over the Moses initial
system (e.g. up to +9.8 BLEU and -8.2 TER for
news fr?en). Unsurprisingly, tuning on a met-
ric yields better results for the same metric for
the first iteration; however, we note that this is
not always true for the TER metric at later itera-
tions (cf. news en?fr). More generally, tuning
on the TER metric results in lower improvements
for news, which are mostly concentrated on the
first iterations; as systems tuned on BLEU have
been found to produce better translations than sys-
tems tuned on TER (Cer et al., 2010), only BLEU
tuning was used for medical.
7
Improvements follow an interesting pattern
over PPE iterations: for instance, on news
fr?en, BLEU scores steadily increase after each
new touch-based iteration and reach a gain
of +21.1 BLEU and -12.3 TER over the initial
Moses translation after 5 PPE iterations. Re-
sults are very comparable on both language pairs
and both domains, e.g. gains of +12.1 BLEU
and -9.7 TER are obtained on fr?en medical.
The lesser amplitude of the gains obtained after
5 iterations may be attributed to the higher ini-
7
We have observed a tendency of the TER tuning to shrink
the size of hypotheses, resulting in higher brevity penalty val-
ues for BLEU and a higher number of insertions for TER.

Figures 4 and 5 show how our TER
PPE
metric
varies for different values of our ? parameter (re-
call that ? = 0 corresponds to TER). Essentially,
whatever the value of ?, we observe that any it-
eration of PPE dominates PE (Moses 1-best),
but with a tendency to become as costly as PE for
high, but probably unrealistic values of ?. Tuning
with BLEU allows us to bring regular improve-
ments as the number of iteration increases, while
tuning with TER makes the amplitude of the gains
decrease faster.
Furthermore, results shown in Table 4 point
out the complementarity between negative
models (negative-lm and negative-pt)
and positive models (positive-lm and
positive-pt), with a drop of almost 10 BLEU
points compared to the corresponding config-
uration using all models when removing one
type of models on both translation directions.
The language models (negative-lm and
positive-lm) seem to play a more impor-
tant role during PPE than the phrase tables
(negative-pt and positive-pt), with
a drop of 9.6 BLEU points on news fr?en
when removing the language models against a
significantly lower drop of 4.4 BLEU points when
removing the phrase tables.

4 Discussion and future work
We have introduced pre-post-editing, a minimalist
interactive machine translation paradigm where a
user is only asked to spot text fragments that may
be used in the final translation. Our approach is
quite comparable to the two-pass procedure de-
scribed by Luong et al. (2014) using word-level
confidence estimation (e.g. (Bach et al., 2011)) to
update the cost of the search graph hypotheses.
However, contrarily to Luong et al.’s work, our
PPE framework is efficiently multi-pass, updates
the models over iterations and relies on more in-
formative annotations made at n-gram-level. Our
evaluation based on simulated post-editing has re-
vealed a large potential for translation improve-
ment. Interestingly, the type of interaction defined

is very different from that expected of a post-editor
or in existing interactive translation modes, and
lends itself nicely to touch-based interaction. Fur-
thermore, our proposal may in fact define a new
role in Computer-Assisted Translation, with PPE
being performed on-the-go on mobile devices by
more people than available human translators, and
even possibly by monolinguals of the target lan-
guage whose contribution may be more efficiently
exploited than that of monolinguals of the source
language (e.g. (Resnik et al., 2010)).
In terms of usability, our future work will fo-
cus on two important questions: (a) study the
actual use of PPE in an interactive setting and
tune the ? parameter for our TER
PPE
metric on
HTER (Snover et al., 2006) traces, and (b) study
whether PPE alters in any positive way the work
of the human translator performing the resid-
ual post-editing, hoping that PE could become
a less tedious task by nature. We further an-
ticipate that some additions would improve our
approach, including dealing early with out-of-
vocabulary phrases, proposing local drop-down
options (e.g. (Koehn and Haddow, 2009)), possi-
bly clustered by senses, allowing the user to eas-
ily fix reordering issues, and adapting PPE to be
discourse-aware (e.g. (Ture et al., 2012)).
