Abstract
Large-scale Knowledge Bases (such as
NELL, Yago, Freebase, etc.) are often
sparse, i.e., a large number of valid rela-
tions between existing entities are missing.
Recent research have addressed this prob-
lem by augmenting the KB graph with ad-
ditional edges mined from a large text cor-
pus while keeping the set of nodes fixed,
and then using the Path Ranking Algo-
rithm (PRA) to perform KB inference over
this augmented graph. In this paper, we
extend this line of work by augmenting
the KB graph not only with edges, but
also with bridging entities, where both the
edges and bridging entities are mined from
a 500 million web text corpus. Through
experiments on real-world datasets, we
demonstrate the value of bridging entities
in improving the performance and running
time of PRA in the KB inference task.
1 Introduction
Large-scale knowledge bases (KB) like Freebase
(Bollacker et al., 2008), Yago (Suchanek et al.,
2007), NELL (Mitchell et al., 2015) can be use-
ful in a variety of applications like natural lan-
guage question answering, semantic search en-
gines, etc. These knowledge bases consist of mil-
lions of real world entities and relationships be-
tween them which are stored in the form of a di-
rected graph where links represent relations and
nodes represent the entities. Although such KBs
contain millions of entities, they are still very
sparse, i.e., they are missing a large number of
relations between existing entities (West et al.,
2014).
Performing inference over the knowledge graph
for predicting relations between two entities is one
way of densifying the KB graph. For example,
Figure 1: Example showing how addition of the
bridging entity, Brian McCain, and the two edges
incident on it can help the PRA algorithm (Lao and
Cohen, 2010) to infer the initially missing relation
instance teamPlaysSport(Yankees, BaseBall). The
original KB graph consisted only of two nodes,
Yankees and Baseball, and no edges.
from (Germany, playsinTournament, FIFA) and
(FIFA, tournamentofSport, Soccer), we can infer
(Germany, playsSport, Soccer). The Path Ranking
Algorithm (PRA) (Lao and Cohen, 2010), (Lao et
al., 2011) performs such an inference by learning
inference rules over the knowledge graph.
If the knowledge graph is sparse, i.e., if there
are a very few or no paths between source and
target entities, then PRA is unable to predict the
existence of a relation. To address this shortcom-
ing, (Lao et al., 2012) augmented the knowledge
graph with paths obtained from an external corpus.
The added paths consisted of unlexicalized depen-
dency labels obtained from a dependency parsed
external corpus. To improve the expressivity of
the added paths, instead of the unlexicalized la-
bels, (Gardner et al., 2013) augmented the KB
graph with verbs (surface relations) from a corpus
containing over 600 million Subject-Verb-Object
(SVO) triples. These verbs act as edges that con-
nect previously unconnected entities thereby in-
creasing the connectivity of the KB graph which
can potentially improve PRA performance.
However, na¨?vely adding these edges increases
the feature sparsity which degrades the discrim-
inative ability of the logistic regression classifier
2038
used in PRA. This can be addressed by adding la-
tent relations obtained by clustering the surface re-
lations, instead of directly adding the surface rela-
tions. This reduces feature sparsity and has been
shown to improve PRA inference (Gardner et al.,
2013) , (Gardner et al., 2014).
In this article we propose a scheme for aug-
menting the KB using paths obtained by mining
noun phrases that connect two SVO triples from
an external corpus. We term these noun phrases
as bridging entities since they bridge two KB re-
lations to form a path. This is different from the
scheme in (Gardner et al., 2013) and (Gardner et
al., 2014), which adds edges between KB nodes
by mining surface relations from an external cor-
pus. We search for such bridging entities in the
corpus by performing a limited depth DFS (depth
first search) on the corpus graph in an on-demand
fashion.
We term this procedure as On-Demand Aug-
mentation (ODA), because the search can be per-
formed during test time in an on-demand man-
ner. In contrast, the previous approaches of adding
edges or embeddings to the KB (Gardner et al.,
2013), and vector space random walk PRA (Gard-
ner et al., 2014) are batch procedures. As we shall
see in Section 4, due to a limited search space,
on-demand augmentation is much faster compared
to algorithms in (Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner
et al., 2014). Furthermore, since edges are not
added blindly, on-demand augmentation does not
increase feature sparsity which is responsible for
performance degradation. Our experiments sug-
gest that ODA provides better performance than
(Gardner et al., 2013) and nearly the same pre-
diction performance as provided by (Gardner et
al., 2014), but in both cases with the added ad-
vantage of faster running time and greater flex-
ibility due to its online and on-demand nature.
The code along with the results can be obtained

2 Related Work
Using surface level relations and noun phrases
for extracting meaningful relational facts is not a
new idea (Hearst, 1992),(Brin, 1999), (Etzioni et
al., 2004). However, none of them make use of
Knowledge Bases for improving information ex-
traction.
The Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) first pro-
posed in (Lao and Cohen, 2010) was used for per-
forming inference over a KB in (Lao et al., 2011).
It was extended by (Lao et al., 2012), to improve
the inference by augmenting the KB with syntactic
information obtained from a dependency parsed
corpus. Augmenting the KB for improving PRA
inference using surface relations mined from an
external corpus and using latent edge labels ob-
tained by performing PCA on the surface relations
was explored in (Gardner et al., 2013). Instead
of hard mapping of surface relations to latent em-
beddings, (Gardner et al., 2014) perform a ‘soft’
mapping using vector space random walks. This
allows the random walker to traverse an edge se-
mantically similar to the current edge type more
frequently than other edges.
Although, like others, we too use an external
corpus to augment the KB, the crucial difference
in our approach is that apart from adding surface
relations, we also add bridging entities that enable
us to create new paths in the KB. Furthermore, the
procedure is targeted so that only paths that play
a part in inferring the relations that are of interest
are added. Thus, the number of paths added in this
manner is much lower than the number of surface
relations added using the procedure in (Gardner et
al., 2013). As we shall see in Section 4, this results
in a more effective algorithm with faster runtime.
3 Method
3.1 Background: Path Ranking Algorithm
(PRA)
We first present a brief overview of the Path Rank-
ing Algorithm (PRA) (Lao and Cohen, 2010). The
PRA uses paths as features for a logistic regres-
sion classifier which predicts if the given relation
exists between a pair of entities. For a given pair
of entities s and t, the path type connecting s to t
form the feature vector. A path types pi is an or-
dered set of relations. Paths with the same ordered
relations but different intermediate or terminal en-
tities belong to the same path type. For example,
s
1
v
0
?? x
1
v
1
?? t
1
and s
2

?? x

?? t

belong
to path type
v

??
v

??. The value of a feature, is
taken to be P (s ? t;pi), where P (s ? t;pi) is
the probability of reaching t from s by traversing
paths of type pi. PRA approximates these proba-
bilities by running a random walk (RW) on the KB
graph. Let F = {pi
1
, pi
2
, ..., pi
k
} be the set of all
path types. For predicting the existence of relation
r between entities s and t, the logistic regression
classifier outputs a score which is a measure of the

confidence that r exists between s and t. It does
so by first assigning weights to the features in the
training phase. The score is given by

where ?

is the weight learned by the logistic re-
gression classifier during training specially for re-
lation r and path type pi. During the test phase,
since targets are not available, the PRA gathers
candidate targets by performing a random walk
and then computes feature vectors and the score.
3.2 PRA-SVO and PRA-VS
PRA-SVO and PRA-VS are the systems proposed
in (Gardner et al., 2013) and (Gardner et al., 2014)
respectively, where the KB graph is augmented
with edges mined from a large subject-verb-object
(SVO) triple corpus. In these two systems, only
new edges are added over the fixed set of nodes,
and the augmentation happens in a batch, offline
setting. In contrast, PRA-ODA, the method pro-
posed in the paper, also expands the set of nodes
through bridging entities, and performs the aug-
mentation in an on-demand manner.
3.3 PRA On-Demand Augmentation
(PRA-ODA)
Training: Let s and t be any two KB entities
and let s

and t

be their corresponding noun
phrase representations or aliases. We search for

ited depth first search (DFS) starting with s

present in the corpus graph. This is done for all
n ? d
max
? 1, where d
max
is the maximum depth
of DFS. We add an ‘ALIAS’ edge between the KB
entity and its noun phase representation. The use-
fulness of bridging entities is illustrated in Fig. 1.
We mine bridging entities from a corpus con-
taining over 600 million SVO triples which were
obtained from the ClueWeb09 corpus (Callan et
al., 2009) parsed using the MALT parser (Nivre et
al., 2007). We use Mongo DB to store the triples
as an adjacency list. During training time, for any
relation that is being inferred, both the source and
its corresponding target entities are known. A lim-
ited depth DFS is performed for all depths less
then d
max
on the SVO graph with the aliases of
subject entity acting as the starting points. Such
aliases are available for the NELL and Freebase
knowledge bases. The DFS is said to discover a
path if the terminating entity of the path matches
any alias of the target entity. We choose to use
aliases to perform string match, since it is easy to
change the softness of the match by simply adding
more aliases. This is done for all training source-
target pairs. A few examples of added paths are
shown in Table 1.
The SVO graph is noisy since it is obtained by
parsing the ClueWeb corpus which was obtained
by scraping the web. To reduce noise, we add the
top K most frequent discovered SVO path types,
whereK is a tunable parameter. By SVO path type
we refer to a set of ordered verbs mined from the
SVO corpus. There is a possibility that the bridg-
ing entities, extracted from the corpus, may be
present in the KB. If the bridging entity matches
any alias, then it is treated as an alias to an existing
KB entity. If not, then the bridging entity is added
to the KB as a new entity. To avoid overfitting
we add negative data to the training set. Further-
more, only high quality expressive bridging enti-
ties result in meaningful and discriminative paths.
Although the quality of bridging entities depend
on the corpus, low quality bridging entities can
be filtered out by adding negative training data.
Low quality bridging entities connect source tar-
get pairs from both positive and negative training
sets, and hence are eliminated by the sparse lo-
gistic regression classifier. The negative dataset is
generated using the closed world assumption by
performing a random walk.
After augmenting the KB, we run the training
phase of the PRA algorithm to obtain the feature
(path) weights computed by the logistic regression

Query Time: The set of target entities corre-
sponding to a source entity and the relation be-
ing predicted is not available during query (test)
time. We use all the entities included in the range
of the relation being predicted as candidate target
entities. For example, if the relation is riverFlow-
sThroughCity, the candidate target set would in-
clude entities in the KB that are cities. The DFS
is now performed starting from source entities as
during training, but this time only restricting to
paths with positive weights learned during train-
ing. Any path (along with bridging entities) found
during this search are added to the KB, and the
PRA algorithm is now run over this augmented
graph.
4 Experiments
We used the implementation of PRA provided by
the authors of (Gardner et al., 2014). For our ex-
periments, we used the same 10 NELL relation
data as used in (Gardner et al., 2014). The aug-
mentation resulted in the addition of 1086 paths
during training and 1430 paths during test time.
We split the NELL data into 60% training
data, 15 % development data and 25% test
data. Values for d
max

quent paths, were obtained by tuning on a

the highest MRR and were used for the rest of
the relations. For the L

parameters in the logistic regression classifier, we
used the same values as used in (Gardner et al.,
2013; Gardner et al., 2014), viz., L
1
= 0.005, and
L
2
= 1.0. This is because the parameters were
reported to be robust, and seemed to work well
even when the knowledge base was augmented.
We compare the results (PRA-ODA) with the
PRA algorithm executed on the NELL KB, NELL
KB augmented with surface relations (PRA-SVO)
(Gardner et al., 2013) and vector space random
walk PRA (PRA-VS) (Gardner et al., 2014). The
run times, i.e, the time taken to perform an entire
experiment for PRA-SVO and PRA-VS includes
the time taken to augment NELL KB with SVO
edges. The PRA-VS runtime also includes the
time taken for generating embeddings to perform
the vector space random walk. As can be seen
from Table 2 and Table 3, our scheme, PRA-ODA,
provides performance equivalent to PRA-VS with
faster running time (speed up of 1.8). In addition
to the time taken for the full SVO augmentation,
PRA-VS takes additional time to generate embed-
dings (13 minutes) from the added verbs. We note
that the batch augmentation in case of PRA-SVO
and PRA-VS, and embedding computation in case
of PRA-VS are all specific to the relations in the
evaluation set, and hence can’t be ignored as a
one-time offline cost. In other words, these costs
are likely to increase as more relations (and their
instances) are included during training and test-
ing. Runtime gains with PRA-ODA are likely to
be even more pronounced in such settings.
2041
An additional advantage of the proposed algo-
rithm is that it can also be run on the top of any
PRA based algorithm such as the PRA-SVO and
PRA-VS.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigated the usefulness of
adding paths to a Knowledge Base for improving
its connectivity by mining bridging entities from
an external corpus. While previous KB augmen-
tation methods focused only on augmentation us-
ing mined surface verbs while keeping the node
set fixed, we extended these approaches by also
adding bridging entities in an online fashion. We
used a large corpus of 500 million web text corpus
to mine these additional edges and bridging enti-
ties. Through experiments on real-world datasets,
we demonstrate that the proposed approach is not
only comparable or better than other state-of-the-
art baselines, but more importantly provides faster
overall runtime compared with the alternatives.
