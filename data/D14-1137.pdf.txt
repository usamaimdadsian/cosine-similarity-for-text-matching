Abstract
We propose a novel model for parsing
natural language sentences into their for-
mal semantic representations. The model
is able to perform integrated lexicon ac-
quisition and semantic parsing, mapping
each atomic element in a complete seman-
tic representation to a contiguous word
sequence in the input sentence in a re-
cursive manner, where certain overlap-
pings amongst such word sequences are
allowed. It defines distributions over the
novel relaxed hybrid tree structures which
jointly represent both sentences and se-
mantics. Such structures allow tractable
dynamic programming algorithms to be
developed for efficient learning and decod-
ing. Trained under a discriminative set-
ting, our model is able to incorporate a rich
set of features where certain unbounded
long-distance dependencies can be cap-
tured in a principled manner. We demon-
strate through experiments that by exploit-
ing a large collection of simple features,
our model is shown to be competitive to
previous works and achieves state-of-the-
art performance on standard benchmark
data across four different languages. The
system and code can be downloaded from

1 Introduction
Semantic parsing, the task of transforming natu-
ral language sentences into formal representations
of their underlying semantics, is one of the clas-
sic goals for natural language processing and ar-
tificial intelligence. This area of research recently
has received a significant amount of attention. Var-
ious models have been proposed over the past few
years (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Kate and

representation (above) and its corresponding nat-
ural language sentence.

al., 2008; Jones et al., 2012).
Following previous research efforts, we perform
semantic parsing under a setting where the seman-
tics for complete sentences are provided as train-
ing data, but detailed word-level semantic infor-
mation is not explicitly given during the training
phase. As one example, consider the following
natural language sentence paired with its corre-
sponding semantic representation:
What rivers do not run through Tennessee ?
answer(exclude(river(all), traverse(stateid(
?
tn
?
))))
The training data consists of a set of sentences
paired with semantic representations. Our goal is
to learn from such pairs a model, which can be
effectively used for parsing novel sentences into
their semantic representations.
Certain assumptions about the semantics are
typically made. One common assumption is that
the semantics can be represented as certain re-
cursive structures such as trees, which consist of
atomic semantic units as tree nodes. For exam-
ple, the above semantics can be converted into an
equivalent tree structure as illustrated in Figure 1.
We will provide more details about such tree struc-
tured semantic representations in Section 2.1.
1308
Currently, most state-of-the-art approaches that
deal with such tree structured semantic represen-
tations either cast the semantic parsing problem as
a statistical string-to-string transformation prob-
lem (Wong and Mooney, 2006), which ignores
the potentially useful structural information of the
tree, or employ latent-variable models to cap-
ture the correspondences between words and tree
nodes using a generative approach (Lu et al., 2008;
Jones et al., 2012). While generative models can
be used to flexibly model the correspondences be-
tween individual words and semantic nodes of the
tree, such an approach is limited to modeling local
dependencies and is unable to flexibly incorporate
a large set of potentially useful features.
In this work, we propose a novel model for
parsing natural language into tree structured se-
mantic representations. Specifically, we propose
a novel relaxed hybrid tree representation which
jointly encodes both natural language sentences
and semantics; such representations can be effec-
tively learned with a latent-variable discriminative
model where long-distance dependencies can be
captured. We present dynamic programming al-
gorithms for efficient learning and decoding. With
a large collection of simple features, our model
reports state-of-the-art results on benchmark data
annotated with four different languages.
Furthermore, although we focus our discussions
on semantic parsing in this work, our proposed
model is a general. Essentially our model is a dis-
criminative string-to-tree model which recursively
maps overlapping contiguous word sequences to
tree nodes at different levels, where efficient dy-
namic programming algorithms can be used. Such
a model may find applications in other areas of
natural language processing, such as statistical
machine translation and information extraction.
2 Background
2.1 Semantics
Various semantic formalisms have been consid-
ered for semantic parsing. Examples include the
tree-structured semantic representations (Wong
and Mooney, 2006), the lambda calculus expres-
sions (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Wong and
Mooney, 2007), and dependency-based compo-
sitional semantic representations (Liang et al.,
2013). In this work, we specifically focus on the
tree-structured representations for semantics.
Each semantic representation consists of se-
mantic units as its tree nodes, where each semantic
unit is of the following form:
m
a
? ?
a
: p
?
(?
b
?) (1)
Here m
a
is used to denote a complete seman-
tic unit, which consists of its semantic type ?
a
, its
function symbol p
?
, as well as an argument list ?
b
?
(we assume there are at most two arguments for
each semantic unit). In other words, each seman-
tic unit can be regarded as a function which takes
in other semantics of specific types as arguments,
and returns new semantics of a particular type. For
example, in Figure 1, the semantic unit at the root
has a type QUERY, a function name answer, and
a single argument type RIVER.
2.2 Joint Representations
Semantic parsing models transform sentences into
their corresponding semantics. It is therefore es-
sential to make proper assumptions about joint
representations for language and semantics that
capture how individual words and atomic seman-
tic units connect to each other. Typically, differ-
ent existing models employ different assumptions
for establishing such connections, leading to very
different definitions of joint representations. We
survey in this section various representations pro-
posed by previous works.
The WASP semantic parser (Wong and Mooney,
2006) essentially casts the semantic parsing prob-
lem as a string-to-string transformation problem
by employing a statistical phrase-based machine
translation approach with synchronous gram-
mars (Chiang, 2007). Therefore, one can think of
the joint representation for both language and se-
mantics as a synchronous derivation tree consist-
ing of those derivation steps for transforming sen-
tences into target semantic representation strings.
While this joint representation is flexible, allow-
ing blocks of semantic structures to map to word
sequences, it does not fully exploit the structural
information (tree) as conveyed by the semantics.
The KRISP semantic parser (Kate and Mooney,
2006) makes use of Support Vector Machines with
string kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002) to recursively
map contiguous word sequences into semantic
units to construct a tree structure. Our relaxed
hybrid tree structures also allow input word se-
quences to map to semantic units in a recursive
manner. One key distinction, as we will see, is that
our structure distinguishes words which are imme-
1309
diately associated with a particular semantic unit,
from words which are remotely associated.
The SCISSOR model (Ge and Mooney, 2005)
performs integrated semantic and syntactic pars-
ing. The model parses natural language sentences
into semantically augmented parse trees whose
nodes consist of both semantic and syntactic labels
and then builds semantic representations based on
such augmented trees. Such a joint representation
conveys more information, but requires language-
specific syntactic analysis.
The hybrid tree model (Lu et al., 2008) is based
on the assumption that there exists an underlying
generative process which jointly produces both the
sentence and the semantic tree in a top-down re-
cursive manner. The generative process results in
a hybrid tree structure which consists of words as
leaves and semantic units as nodes. An example
hybrid tree structure is shown in Figure 2 (a). Such
a representation allows each semantic unit to map
to a possibly discontiguous sequence of words.
The model was shown to be effective empirically,
but it implicitly assumes that both the sentence and
semantics exhibit certain degree of structural sim-
ilarity that allows the hybrid tree structures to be
constructed.
UBL (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010) is a semantic
parser based on restricted higher-order unification
with CCG (Steedman, 1996). The model can be
used to handle both tree structured semantic rep-
resentations and lambda calculus expressions, and
assumes there exist CCG derivations as joint rep-
resentations in which each semantic unit is associ-
ated with a contiguous word sequence where over-
lappings amongst word sequences are not allowed.
Jones et al. (2012) recently proposed a frame-
work that performs semantic parsing with tree
transducers. The model learns representations that
are similar to the hybrid tree structures using a
generative process under a Bayesian setting. Thus,
their representations also potentially present simi-
lar issues as the ones mentioned above.
Besides these supervised approaches, recently
there are also several works that take alternative
learning approaches to (mostly task-dependent)
semantic parsing. Poon and Domingos (2009) pro-
posed a model for unsupervised semantic pars-
ing that transforms dependency trees into seman-
tic representations using Markov logic (Richard-
son and Domingos, 2006). Clarke et al. (2010)
proposed a model that learns a semantic parser

an unsupervised approach for semantic parsing
based on self-training driven by confidence esti-
mation. Liang et al. (2013) proposed a model for
learning the dependency-based compositional se-
mantics (DCS) which can be used for optimiz-
ing the end-task performance. Artzi and Zettle-
moyer (2013) proposed a model for mapping in-
structions to actions with weak supervision.
3 Approach
We discuss our approach to semantic parsing in
this section. The notation that we use in this paper
is summarized in Table 1.
3.1 Model
In standard supervised syntactic parsing, one typi-
cally has access to a complete syntactic parse tree
for each sentence in the training phase, which ex-
actly tells the correct associations between words
and syntactic labels. In our problem, however,
each sentence is only paired with a complete se-
mantic representation where the correct associa-
tions between words and semantic units are un-
available. We thus need to model such information
with latent variables.
For a given n-m pair (where n is a complete
natural language sentence, and m is a complete
semantic representation), we assume there exists a
latent joint representation h that consists of both n
andmwhich tells the correct associations between
words and semantic units in such a pair. We use
H(n,m)
1
to denote the set of all such possible
1
We will give a concrete definition of H(n,m) used for
this work, which is the complete set of all possible relaxed
hybrid tree structures for the n-m pair, when we discuss our
own joint representations later in Section 3.2.

Figure 2: Two different ways of jointly representing sentences and their semantics. The hybrid tree
representation of Lu et al. (2008) (left), and our novel relaxed hybrid tree representation (right). In
our representation, a word w can be either immediately associated with its parent m (the words which
appear inside the parenthesis), or remotely associated with m (the words that do not appear inside the
parenthesis, and will also appear under a subtree rooted by one of m’s children).
latent joint representations that contain both n and
m exactly.
Given the joint representations, to model how
the data is generated, one can either take a gener-
ative approach which models the joint probability
distribution over (n,m,h) tuples, or a discrimina-
tive approach which models the distribution over
(m,h) tuples given the observation n. Following
several previous research efforts (Zettlemoyer and
Collins, 2005; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010; Liang et
al., 2013), in this work we define a discriminative
model using a log-linear approach:
P (m,h|n; ?) =
e
?·?(n,m,h)
?
m
?
,h
?
?H(n,m
?
)
e
?·?(n,m
?
,h
?
)
(2)
Here ?(n,m,h) is a function defined over the
tuple (n,m,h) that returns a vector consisting of
counts of features associated with the tuple, and ?
is a vector consisting of feature weights, which are
the parameters of the model.
In practice, we are only given the n-m pairs but
the latent structures are not observed. We there-
fore consider the following marginal probability:
P (m|n; ?) =
?
h?H(n,m)
P (m,h|n; ?)

employed to optimize the objective function. We

tion and gradients next.

tree representation, such a dependency can still be captured.
certain restrictions on the latent structures (h) will
need to be imposed. We define in this section the
set of all valid latent structures H(n,m) for the
(n,m) pair so that some efficient dynamic pro-
gramming algorithms can be deployed.
We introduce our novel relaxed hybrid tree rep-
resentations which jointly encode both natural lan-
guage sentences and the tree-structured semantics.
A relaxed hybrid tree h defined over (n,m) is a
tree whose nodes are (n,m) pairs, where each n is
a contiguous sequence of words from n, and each
m is a semantic unit (a tree node) from m. For
any two nodes h
a
? (n

) and h
b
? (n
b
,m

)
that appear in the relaxed hybrid tree h, if h
a
is the
parent of h
b
in h, then m
a
must also be the parent
of m
b
in m, and n
a
must contain n
b
. If the low-
est common ancestor of h
a
and h
b
in h is neither
h
a
nor h
b
, then n
a
and n
b
do not share any com-
mon word. Note that words that appear at different
positions in n are regarded as different words, re-
gardless of their string forms.

tree structure that we consider. Assume we would

. These words
play unique roles in the sub-tree rooted by m
b
and
are expected to be semantically closely related to
m
b
. Note that each word is immediately associ-
ated with exactly one semantic unit.
As a comparison, we also show an example hy-
brid tree representation (Lu et al., 2008) in Fig-
ure 2 (a) that has similar words-semantics cor-
respondences. Different from our representation,
the hybrid tree representation assumes each natu-
ral language word only maps to a single seman-
tic unit (which is its immediate parent), and each
semantic unit maps to a possibly discontiguous
sequence of words. We believe that such a rep-
resentation is overly restrictive, which might ex-
hibit problems in cases where natural language
sentences are highly non-isomorphic to their se-
mantic tree structures. Under our relaxed hybrid
tree representations, words that are immediately
associated with a particular semantic unit now can
also be remotely associated with all its parent se-
mantic units as well. Essentially, our representa-
tion allows us to capture certain unbounded depen-
dencies – for any word, as long as it appears be-
low a certain semantic unit (in the relaxed hybrid
tree), we can always capture the dependency be-
tween the two, regardless of which actual seman-
tic unit that word is immediately associated with.
Such an important relaxation allows some long-
distance dependencies to be captured, which can
potentially alleviate the sentence-semantics non-
isomorphism issue reported in several earlier se-
mantic parsing works (Kate and Mooney, 2006;
1312
Wong and Mooney, 2007).
To better illustrate the differences, we show a
concrete example in Figure 3, where the correct
latent structure showing the correspondences be-
tween words and semantic units can not be found
with the hybrid tree model. As a result, the hy-
brid tree model will fail to capture the correct de-
pendency between the words “how many” and the
semantic unit “NUM : count(STATE)”. On the
other hand, with our relaxed hybrid tree represen-
tation, such a dependency can still be captured,
since these words will still be (remotely) associ-
ated with the semantic unit.
Such a relaxed hybrid tree representation, when
further constrained with the word association pat-
terns that we will introduce next, allows both the
objective function (4) and the gradients of (5) to
be computed through the dynamic programming
algorithms to be presented in Section 4.
3.3 Word Association Patterns
As we have mentioned above, in the relaxed hy-
brid tree structures, each word w under a certain
semantic unit m can either appear directly below
m only (immediately associated with m), or can
also appear in a subtree rooted by one ofm’s child
semantic unit (remotely associated with m).
We allow several different ways for word asso-
ciations and define the allowable patterns for se-
mantic units with different number of arguments
in Table 2. Such patterns are defined so that our
model is amendable to dynamic programming al-
gorithms to be discussed in Sec 4. In this table,
w refers to a contiguous sequence of natural lan-
guage words that are immediately associated with
the current semantic unit, while X and Y refers
to a sequence of natural language words that the
first and second child semantic unit will map to,
respectively.
For example, in Figure 2 (b), the word sequence
directly below the semantic unit m
a
follows the
pattern wX (since the word sequence w
1
w
2
w
3
is
immediately associated with m
a
, and the remain-
ing words are remotely associated with m
a
), and
the word sequence below m
b
follows wXwYw
2
.
The word association patterns are similar to
those hybrid patterns used in hybrid trees. One
key difference is that we disallow the unary pat-
2
This is based on the assumption that m
c
and m
d
are the
first and second child of m
b
in the semantic representation,
respectively. If m
d
is the first child in the semantic represen-
tation andm
c
is the second, the pattern should be wYwXw.

tern X. The reason is, when computing the parti-
tion function in Equation 3, inclusion of pattern X
will result in relaxed hybrid trees consisting of an
infinite number of nodes. However, this issue does
not come up in the original hybrid tree models due
to their generative setting, where the training pro-
cess does not involve such a partition function.
3.4 Features
The features are defined over the (n,m,h) tuples.
In practice, we define features at each level of the
relaxed hybrid tree structure h. In other words,
features are defined over (n,m) tuples where n is
a contiguous sequence of natural language words
(immediately or remotely) associated with the se-
mantic unit m (recall that h contains both n and
m, and each level of h simply consists of a seman-
tic unit and a contiguous sequence of words). Each
feature over (n,m) is then further decomposed
as a product between two indicator feature func-
tions, defined over the natural language words (n)
and semantic unit (m) respectively: ?(n,m) =
?
i
(n) × ?
o
(m). For each ?
i
(n) we define two
types of features: the local features, which are de-
fined over immediately associated words only, and
the span features, which are defined over all (im-
mediately or remotely) associated words to cap-
ture long range dependencies.
The local features include word unigrams and
bigrams, the word association patterns, as well as
character-level features
3
which perform implicit
morphological analysis. The span features include
word unigrams, bigrams, as well as trigrams. Al-
though our model allows certain more sophisti-
cated features to be exploited, such as word POS
features, word similarity features based on the
WordNet (Pedersen et al., 2004), we deliberately
choose to only include these simple features so

For each word, we used all its prefixes (not necessarily
linguistically meaningful ones) whose length are greater than
2 as features, for all languages.
1313
as to make a fair comparison with previous works
which also did not make use of external resources.
For the features defined on m (i.e., ?
o
(m)), we in-
clude only the string form of m, as well as m’s
function name as features.
Finally, we also define features over m only.
Such features are defined over semantic unit pairs
such as (m
a
,m
b
) where m
a
is the parent node of
m

4 Algorithms
In this section we describe the efficient algorithms
used for learning and decoding. The algorithms
are inspired by the inside-outside style algorithms
used for the generative hybrid tree models (Lu
et al., 2008), but are different in the following
ways: 1) we need to handle features, including
long-distance features, 2) we need to additionally
handle the computation of the partition function of
Equation (3).
4.1 Learning
The training process involves the computation of
the objective function (4) as well as the gradient
terms (5).
The objective function (4) (excluding the regu-
larization term which can be trivially computed) is
equivalent to the following:
L(?) =
?
i
log
?
h?H(n
i
,m
i
)
e
?·?(n
i
,m
i
,h)
?
?
i
log
?
m
?
,h
?
?H(n
i
,m
?
)
e
?·?(n
i
,m
?
,h
?
)
(6)
In the first term,
?
h?H(n
i
,m
i
)
e
?·?(n
i
,m
i
,h)
is
in fact the sum of the scores (as defined by ? and
?) associated with all such latent structures that
contain both m
i
and n
i
exactly. The second term
is the sum of the scores associated with all the la-
tent structures that contain n
i
exactly. We focus
our discussions on the computation of the first part
first.
We use
m
(p)
w
i
. . . w
j
to denote the combined score
of all such latent relaxed hybrid tree structures that
contain both the semantic tree rooted bym and the
natural language word sequence w
i
. . . w
j
that
forms the word association pattern p with respect
to m. For example, the score of the relaxed hybrid
tree in Figure 2 (b) is contained by
m
a
(wX)
w
1
. . . w
10
(here p = wX because only w
1
w
2
w
3
are imme-
diately associated with m
a
).
We give an illustrative example that shows how
these scores can be computed efficiently using dy-
namic programming. Consider the following case
when m has at least one child semantic unit:
m
(wXw)
w
i
. . . w
j
=
m
(w)
w
i
?
m
(wXw)
w
i+1
. . . w
j
+
m
(w)
w
i
?
m
(Xw)
w
i+1
. . . w
j
Here the symbol ? means extract and compute,
a process that involves 1) extraction of additional
features when the two structures on the right-hand
side are put together (for example, the local bi-
gram feature “w
i
w
i+1
” can be extracted in the
above case), and 2) computation of the score for
the new structure when the two structures from
both sides of ? are combined, based on the scores
of these structures and newly extracted features.
The above equation holds because for any re-
laxed hybrid tree contained by the left-hand side,
the left-most word w
i
is always immediately as-
sociated with m. The term
m
(wXw)
w
i+1
. . . w
j
is present-
ing a similar but smaller structure to the term on
the left-hand side. The other term
m
(wX)
w
i
. . . w
j
can
also be computed based on similar equations. In
other words, such terms can be computed from
even smaller similar terms in a recursive manner.
A bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm is
used for computing such terms.
When the semantic unit m has two child nodes,
similar equations can also be established. Here we
give an illustrative example:
m
(wXwYw)
w
i
. . . w
j
=
?
j?1
k=i
m
(wX)
w
i
. . . w
k
?
m
(wYw)
w
k+1
. . . w
j
Finally, we have the following equation:
m
w
i
. . . w
j
=
?
p
m
(p)
w
i
. . . w
j
The left-hand side simply means the combined
score for all such relaxed hybrid trees that have
(n,m) as the root, where n ? w
i
. . . w
j
. Once the
computation for a certain (n,m) pair is done, we
1314
can move up to process such pairs that involvem’s
parent node.
The above process essentially computes the in-
side score associated with the (n,m) pair, which
gives the sum of the scores of all such (incomplete)
relaxed hybrid trees that can be constructed with
(n,m) as the root. Similar to (Lu et al., 2008), we
can also define and compute the outside scores for
(n,m) (the combined score of such incomplete re-
laxed hybrid trees that contain (n,m) as one of its
leave nodes) in an analogous manner, where the
computation of the gradient functions can be effi-
ciently integrated in this process.
Computation of the second part of the objective
function (6) involves dynamic programming over
a packed forest representation rather than a single
tree, which requires an extension to the algorithm
described in (Lu et al., 2008). The resulting al-
gorithm is similar to the one used in (Lu and Ng,
2011), which has been used for language gener-
ation from packed forest representations of typed
?-calculus expressions.
4.2 Decoding
The decoding phase involves finding the optimal
semantic tree m
?
given a new input sentence n:
m
?
= arg max
m
P (m|n) (7)
This in fact is equivalent to finding the follow-
ing optimal semantic tree m
?
:
m
?
= arg max
m
?
h?H(n,m)
e
?·?(n,m,h)
(8)
Unfortunately, the summation operation inside
the arg max prevents us from employing a simi-
lar version of the dynamic programming algorithm
we developed for learning in Section 4.1. To over-
come this difficulty, we instead find the optimal
semantic tree using the following equation:
m
?
= arg max
m,h?H(n,m)
e
?·?(n,m,h)
(9)
We essentially replace the
?
operation by the
max operation inside the arg max. In other words,
we first find the best latent relaxed hybrid tree h
?
that contains the input sentence n, and next we ex-
tract the optimal semantic tree m
?
from h
?
.
This decoding algorithm is similar to the dy-
namic programming algorithm used for comput-
ing the inside score for a given natural language
sentence n (i.e., the algorithm for computing the
second term of Equation (6)). The difference here
is, at each intermediate step, instead of computing
the combined score for all possible relaxed hybrid
tree structures (i.e., performing sum), we find the
single-best relaxed hybrid tree structure (i.e., per-
forming max).
5 Experiments
We present evaluations on the standard GeoQuery
dataset which is publicly available. This dataset
has been used for evaluations in various seman-
tic parsing works (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate
and Mooney, 2006; Lu et al., 2008; Jones et al.,
2012). It consists of 880 natural language sen-
tences paired with their corresponding formal se-
mantic representations. Each semantic represen-
tation is a tree structured representation derived
from a Prolog query that can be used to interact
with a database of U.S. geography facts for retriev-
ing answers. The original dataset was fully anno-
tated in English, and recently Jones et al. (2012)
released a new version of this dataset with three
additional language annotations (German, Greek
and Thai). For all the experiments, we used the
identical experimental setup as described in Jones
et al. (2012). Specifically, we trained on 600 in-
stances, and evaluated on the remaining 280.
We note that there exist two different versions of
the GeoQuery dataset annotated with completely
different semantic representations. Besides the
version that we use in this work, which is an-
notated with tree structured semantic representa-
tions, the other version is annotated with lambda
calculus expressions (Zettlemoyer and Collins,
2005). Results obtained from these two versions
are not comparable.
4
Like many previous works,
we focus on tree structured semantic representa-
tions for evaluations in this work since our model
is designed for handling the class of semantic rep-
resentations with recursive tree structures.
We used the standard evaluation criteria for
judging the correctness of the outputs. Specifi-
cally, our system constructs Prolog queries from
the output parses, and uses such queries to retrieve
answers from the GeoQuery database. An output
is considered correct if and only if it retrieves the
4
Kwiatkowski et al. (2010) showed in Table 3 of their
work that the version with tree-structured representations ap-
peared to be more challenging – their semantic parser’s per-
formance on this version was substantially lower than that on
the lambda calculus version.

same answers as the gold standard (Jones et al.,
2012). We report accuracy scores – the percentage
of inputs with correct answers, and F1 measures –
the harmonic mean of precision (the proportion of
correct answers out of inputs with an answer) and
recall (the proportion of correct answers out of all
inputs). By adopting such an evaluation method
we will be able to directly compare our model’s
performance against those of the previous works.
The evaluations were conducted under such a
setting in order to make comparisons to previous
works. We would like to stress that our model
is designed for general-purpose semantic parsing
that is not only natural language-independent, but
also task-independent. We thus distinguish our
work from several previous works in the literature
which focused on semantic parsing under other as-
sumptions. Specifically, for example, works such
as (Liang et al., 2013; Poon and Domingos, 2009;
Clarke et al., 2010) essentially performed seman-
tic parsing under different settings where the goal
was to optimize the performance of certain down-
stream NLP tasks such as answering questions,
and different semantic formalisms and language-
specific features were usually involved.
For all our experiments, we used the L-BFGS
algorithm for learning the feature weights, where
feature weights were all initialized to zeros and the
regularization hyper-parameter ? was set to 0.01.
We set the maximum number of L-BFGS steps to
100. When all the features are considered, our
model creates over 2 million features for each lan-
guage on the dataset (English: 2.1M, Thai: 2.3M,
German: 2.7M, Greek: 2.6M). Our model re-
quires (on average) a per-instance learning time of
0.428 seconds and a per-instance decoding time of
0.235 seconds, on an Intel machine with a 2.2 GHz
CPU. Our implementation is in Java. Here the
per-instance learning time refers to the time spent
on computing the instance-level log-likelihood as
well as the expected feature counts (needed for the
gradients).
Table 3 shows the evaluation results of our sys-
tem as well as those of several other comparable
previous works which share the same experimen-
tal setup as ours. UBL-S is the system presented
in Kwiatkowski et al. (2010) which performs se-
mantic parsing with the CCG based on mapping
between graphs, and is the only non-tree based
top-performing system. Their system, similar to
ours, also uses a discriminative log-linear model
where two types of features are defined. WASP is
a model based on statistical phrase-based machine
translation as we have described earlier. The hy-
brid tree model (HYBRIDTREE+) performs learn-
ing using a generative process which is augmented
with an additional discriminative-reranking stage,
where certain global features are incorporated (Lu
et al., 2008). The Bayesian tree transducer model
(TREETRANS) learns under a Bayesian genera-
tive framework, using hyper-parameters manually
tuned on the German training data.
We can observe from Table 3 that the semantic
parser based on relaxed hybrid tree gives compet-
itive performance when all the features (described
in Sec 3.4) are used. It significantly outperforms
the hybrid tree model that is augmented with a dis-
criminative reranking step. The model reports the
best accuracy and F1 scores on English and Thai
and best accuracy score on Greek. The scores
on German are lower than those of UBL-S and
TREETRANS, mainly because the span features
appear not to be effective for this language, as we
will discuss next.
We report in Table 4 the test set performance
when certain types of features are excluded from
our system. Such results can help us understand
the effectiveness of features of different types. As
we can see from the table, in general, all fea-
tures play essential roles, though their effective-

ness vary across different languages. The local
features, which capture local dependencies, are
of particular importance. Performance on three
languages (English, Thai, and Greek) will drop
when such features are excluded. Character-level
features are very helpful for the three European
languages (English, German, and Greek), but ap-
pear to be harmful for Thai. This indicates the
character-level features that we propose do not
perform effective morphological analysis for this
Asian language.
5
The span features, which are
able to capture certain long-distance dependen-
cies, also play important roles. Specifically, if
such features are excluded, our model’s perfor-
mance on three languages (Greek, English, Thai)
will drop. Such features do not appear to be help-
ful for Thai and appear to be harmful for Ger-
man. Clearly, such long-distance features are not
contributing useful information to the model when
these two languages are considered. This is espe-
cially the case for German, where we believe such
features are contributing substantial noisy infor-
mation to the model. What underlying language-
specific, syntactic properties are generally caus-
ing these gaps in the performances? We believe
this is an important question that needs to be ad-
dressed in future research. As we have mentioned,
to make an appropriate comparison with previ-
ous works, only simple features are used. We be-
lieve that our system’s performance can be further
improved when additional informative language-
specific features can be extracted from effective
language tools and incorporated into our system.

brid tree model. Such an extension is similar to the
extension of the generative syntactic parser based
on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG) to
the feature-based CRF parser (Finkel et al., 2008),
but is slightly more complex due to latent struc-
tures. Developed on top of our novel relaxed hy-
brid tree representations, our model allows cer-
tain long-distance dependencies to be captured.
We also present efficient algorithms for learn-
ing and decoding. Experiments on benchmark
data show that our model is competitive to previ-
ous works and achieves the state-of-the-art perfor-
mance across several different languages.
Future works include development of efficient
algorithms for feature-based semantic parsing
with alternative loss functions (Zhou et al., 2013),
development of feature-based language generation
models (Lu et al., 2009; Lu and Ng, 2011) and
multilingual semantic parsers (Jie and Lu, 2014),
as well as the development of efficient semantic
parsing algorithms for optimizing the performance
of certain downstream NLP tasks with less super-
vision (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2013).
Being able to efficiently exploit features defined
over individual words, our model also opens up the
possibility for us to exploit alternative representa-
tions of words for learning (Turian et al., 2010), or
to perform joint learning of both distributional and
logical semantics (Lewis and Steedman, 2013).
Furthermore, as a general string-to-tree structured
prediction model, this work may find applications
in other areas within NLP.
