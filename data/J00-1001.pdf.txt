The idea for this special issue came up during the preparations of the International 
Workshop on Finite-State Methods in Natural Language Processing, that was held at 
Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey in the summer of 1998. The number of the sub- 
missions had exceeded our initial expectations and we were able to select quite a good 
set of papers from those submitted. Further, the workshop and the preceding tutorial 
by Kenneth Beesley, on finite-state methods, was attended by quite a large number of 
participants. This led us to believe that interest in the theory and applications of finite- 
state machinery was alive and well, and that some of the papers from this workshop 
along with further additional submissions could make a very good special issue for 
this journal. The five papers in this issue are the result of this process. 
The last decade has seen a quite a substantial surge in the use of finite-state meth- 
ods in all aspects of natural anguage applications. Fueled by the theoretical contribu- 
tions of Kaplan and Kay (1994), Mohri's recent contributions on the use of finite-state 
techniques in various NLP problems (Mohri 1996, 1997), the success of finite-state ap- 
proaches especially in computational morphology, for example, Koskenniemi (1983), 
Karttunen (1983), and Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen (1992), and, finally, the avail- 
ability of state-of-the-art tools for building and manipulating large-scale finite-state 
systems (Karttunen 1993; Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen et al. 1996; Mohri, 
Pereira, and Riley 1998; van Noord 1999), recent years have seen many successful 
applications of finite-state approaches in tagging, spell checking, information extrac- 
tion, parsing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech applications. This is a remarkable 
comeback considering that in the dawn of modern linguistics (Chomsky 1957), finite- 
state grammars were dismissed as fundamentally inadequate. As a result, most of the 
work in computational linguistics in the past few decades has been focused on far 
more powerful formalisms. 
Recent publications on finite-state technology include two collections of papers 
(Roche and Schabes 1997; Kornai 1999) with contributions covering a wide range of 
these topics. This special issue, we hope, will add to these contributions. 
The five papers in this collection cover many aspects of finite-state theory and 
applications. The papers Treatment of Epsilon Moves in Subset Construction by van Noord 
and Incremental Construction of Minimal Acyclic Finite-State Automata nd Transducers by 
Daciuk, Watson, Watson, and Mihov, address two fundamental aspects in the con- 
struction of finite-state recognizers. Van Noord presents results for various methods 
for producing a deterministic automaton with no epsilon transitions from a nondeter- 
ministic automaton with a large number of epsilon transitions, especially those result- 
ing from finite-state approximations of context-free and more powerful formalisms. 
Daciuk et al. present a new method for constructing minimal, deterministic, acyclic

finite-state machines from a list of input strings, in a single pass. Practical Experiments 
with Regular Approximations of Context-free Languages by Nederhof, presents evaluations 
of various regular approximation algorithms on actual grammars, providing insights 
into pros and cons of such algorithms. Multitiered Nonlinear Morphology Using Multitape 
Finite Automata: A Case Study on Semitic by Kiraz presents the formalism and implemen- 
tation of an approach for dealing with nonlinear phenomena found in the morphology 
of semitic languages and compares his approach with other systems that have been 
proposed for the same languages. Finally, Learning Dependency Translation Models as Col- 
lections of Finite-State Head Transducers by Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, presents 
an application of the finite-state transducer f amework in a machine translation task 
where weighted finite-state head transducers induced from a corpus of aligned par- 
allel sentences are used to recursively map headwords from the source to the target 
language. 
Our guest editorial board for this issue included Ken Beesley, Eric Brill, Eva 
Ejerhed, George Kiraz, AndrOs Kornai, Mehryar Mohri, Mark-Jan Nederhof, Mar- 
tin Kay, Ron Kaplan, and Atro Voutilainen; we received additional help from many 
other eviewers. Julia Hirschberg, editor-in-chief o Computational Linguistics, helped us 
through all aspects of the selection process, guiding us around many intricate issues. 
We thank the guest editorial board, the additional reviewers, and Julia for their superb 
contributions. We hope you find this special issue well worth the effort.
