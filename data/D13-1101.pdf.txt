Abstract
Direct quotations are used for opinion min-
ing and information extraction as they have an
easy to extract span and they can be attributed
to a speaker with high accuracy. However,
simply focusing on direct quotations ignores
around half of all reported speech, which is
in the form of indirect or mixed speech. This
work presents the first large-scale experiments
in indirect and mixed quotation extraction and
attribution. We propose two methods of ex-
tracting all quote types from news articles and
evaluate them on two large annotated corpora,
one of which is a contribution of this work.
We further show that direct quotation attribu-
tion methods can be successfully applied to in-
direct and mixed quotation attribution.
1 Introduction
Quotations are crucial carriers of information, par-
ticularly in news texts, with up to 90% of sentences
in some articles being reported speech (Bergler
et al., 2004). Reported speech is a carrier of evi-
dence and factuality (Bergler, 1992; Saur?´ and Puste-
jovsky, 2009), and as such, text mining applications
use quotations to summarise, organise and validate
information. Extraction of quotations is also rele-
vant to researchers interested in media monitoring.
Most quotation attribution studies (Pouliquen
et al., 2007; Glass and Bangay, 2007; Elson and
McKeown, 2010) thus far have limited their scope
to direct quotations (Ex.1a), as they are delimited
?*These authors contributed equally to this work.
by quotation marks, which makes them easy to ex-
tract. However, annotated resources suggest that di-
rect quotations represent only a limited portion of all
quotations, i.e., around 30% in the Penn Attribution
Relation Corpus (PARC), which covers Wall Street
Journal articles, and 52% in the Sydney Morning
Herald Corpus (SMHC), with the remainder being in-
direct (Ex.1c) or mixed (Ex.1b) quotations. Retriev-
ing only direct quotations can miss key content that
can change the interpretation of the quotation (Ex.
1b) and will entirely miss indirect quotations.

Previous work on extracting indirect and mixed
quotations has suffered from a lack of large-scale
data, and has instead used hand-crafted lexica of re-
porting verbs with rule-based approaches. The lack
of data has also made comparing the relative merit
of these approaches difficult, as existing evaluations
are small-scale and do not compare multiple meth-
ods on the same data.
In this work we address this lack of clear, com-
parable results by evaluating two baseline meth-

ods against both a token-based approach that uses a
Conditional Random Field (CRF) to predict IOB la-
bels, and a maximum entropy classifier that predicts
whether parse nodes are quotations or not. We eval-
uate these approaches on two large-scale corpora
from the news domain that together include over
18,000 quotations. One of these corpora (SMHC) is a
a contribution of this work, while our results are the
first presented on the other corpus (PARC). Instead
of relying on a lexicon of reporting verbs, we de-
velop a classifier to detect verbs introducing a quo-
tation. To inform future research we present results
for direct, indirect, and mixed quotations, as well as
overall results.
Finally, we use the direct quotation attribution
methods described in O’Keefe et al. (2012) and
show that they can be successfully applied to indi-
rect and mixed quotations, albeit with lower accu-
racy. This leads us to conclude that attributing indi-
rect and mixed quotations to speakers is harder than
attributing direct quotations.
With this work, we set a new state of the art in
quotation extraction. We expect that the main con-
tribution of this work will be that future methods can
be evaluated in a comparable way, so that the relative
merit of various approaches can be determined.
2 Background
Pareti (2012) defines an attribution as having a
source span, a cue span, and a content span:
Source is the span of text that indicates who the
content is attributed to, e.g. ‘president Obama’,
‘analysts’, ‘China’, ‘she’.
Cue is the lexical anchor of the attribution relation,
usually a verb, e.g. ‘say’, ‘add’, ‘quip’.
Content is the span of text that is attributed.
Based on the type of attitude the source expresses
towards a proposition or eventuality, attributions are
subcategorised (Prasad et al., 2006) into assertions
(Ex.2a) and beliefs (Ex.2b), which imply different
degrees of commitment, facts (Ex.2c), expressing
evaluation or knowledge, and eventualities (Ex.2d),
expressing intention or attitude.
(2) a. Mr Abbott said that he will win the election.
b. Mr Abbott thinks he will win the election.
c. Mr Abbott knew that Gillard was in Sydney.
d. Mr Abbott agreed to the public sector cuts.
Only assertion attributions necessarily imply a
speech act. Their content corresponds to a quotation
span and their source is generally referred to in the
literature as the speaker. Direct, indirect and mixed
quotations differ in the degree of factuality they en-
tail, since the former are by convention interpreted
as a verbatim transcription of an utterance whereas
indirect and the non-quoted portion of mixed quota-
tions can be paraphrased forms of the original word-
ing, and are thus filtered by the writer’s perspective.
The first speaker attribution systems (Zhang et al.,
2003; Mamede and Chaleira, 2004; Glass and Ban-
gay, 2007) originate from the narrative domain and
were concerned with the identification of different
characters for speech synthesis applications. Direct
quotation attribution, with direct quotations being
given or extracted heuristically, has been the focus
of further studies in both the narrative (Elson and
McKeown, 2010) and news (Pouliquen et al., 2007;
Liang et al., 2010) domains. The few studies that
990
have addressed the extraction and attribution of in-
direct and mixed quotations are discussed below.
Krestel et al. (2008) developed a quotation ex-
traction and attribution system that combines a lexi-
con of 53 common reporting verbs and a hand-built
grammar to detect constructions that match 6 gen-
eral lexical patterns. They evaluate their work on 7
articles from the Wall Street Journal, which contain
133 quotations, achieving macro-averaged Precision
(P ) of 99% and Recall (R) of 74% for quotation
span detection. PICTOR (Schneider et al., 2010) re-
lies instead on a context-free grammar for the extrac-
tion and attribution of quotations. PICTOR yielded
75% P and 86% R in terms of words correctly as-
cribed to a quotation or speaker, while it achieved
56% P and 52% R when measured in terms of com-
pletely correct quotation-speaker pairs.
SAPIENS (de La Clergerie et al., 2011) extracts
quotations from French news, by using a lexicon
of reporting verbs and syntactic patterns to extract
the complement of a reporting verb as the quota-
tion span and its subject as the source. They eval-
uated 40 randomly sampled quotations and found
that their system made 32 predictions and correctly
identified the span in 28 of the 40 cases. Verba-
tim (Sarmento and Nunes, 2009) extracts quotations
from Portuguese news feeds by first finding one of
35 speech verbs and then matching the sentence to
one of 19 patterns. Their manual evaluation shows
that 11.9% of the quotations Verbatim finds are er-
rors and that the system identifies approximately one
distinct quotation for every 46 news articles.
The system presented by Fernandes et al. (2011)
also works over Portuguese news. Their work is the
closest to ours as they partially apply supervised ma-
chine learning to quotation extraction. Their work
introduces GloboQuotes, a corpus of 685 news items
containing 1,007 quotations of which 802 were used
to train an Entropy Guided Transformation Learn-
ing (ETL) algorithm (dos Santos and Milidiu´, 2009).
They treat quotation extraction as an IOB labelling
task, where they use ETL with POS and NE features
to identify the beginning of a quotation, while the
inside and outside labels are found using regular ex-
pressions. Finally they use ETL to attribute quota-
tions to their source. The overall system achieves
64% P and 67% R.
We have summarised these approaches in Table 1,

which shows that the majority of evaluations thus far
have been small-scale. Furthermore, the published
results do not include any comparisons with previ-
ous work, which prevents a quantitative comparison
of the approaches, and they do not include results
broken down by whether the quotation is direct, in-
direct, or mixed. It is these issues that motivate our
work.
3 Corpora
We perform our experiments over two large corpora
from the news domain.
3.1 Penn Attribution Relations Corpus (PARC)
Our first corpus (Pareti, 2012), which we will re-
fer to as PARC, is a semi-automatically built ex-
tension to the attribution annotations included in
the PDTB (Prasad et al., 2008). The corpus covers
2,280 Wall Street Journal articles and contains an-
notations of assertions, beliefs, facts, and eventual-
ities, which are altogether referred to as attribution
relations (ARs). For this work we use only the asser-
tions, as they correspond to quotations (direct, indi-
rect and mixed). The drawback of this corpus is that
it is not yet fully annotated, i.e., it comprises positive
and unlabelled data.
The corpus includes a test set of 14 articles that
are fully annotated, which enables us to properly
evaluate our work and estimate that a proportion of
30-50% of ARs are unlabelled in the rest of the cor-
pus. The test set was manually annotated by two ex-
pert annotators. The annotators identified 491 ARs,
of which 22% were nested within another AR, with
991
an agreement score of 87%1. The agreement for the
selection of the content and source spans of com-
monly annotated ARs was 95% and 94% respec-
tively. In this work we address only non-embedded
assertions, so the final test-set includes 267 quotes,
totalling 321 non-discontinuous gold spans.
3.2 Sydney Morning Herald Corpus (SMHC)
We based our second corpus on the existing anno-
tations of direct quotations within Sydney Morning
Herald articles presented in O’Keefe et al. (2012).
In that work we defined direct quotations as any
text between quotation marks, which included the
directly-quoted portion of mixed quotations, as well
as scare quotes. Under that definition direct quo-
tations could be automatically extracted with very
high accuracy, so annotations in that work were
over the automatically extracted direct quotations.
As part of this work one annotator removed scare
quotes, updated mixed quotations to include both
the directly and indirectly quoted portions, and
added whole new indirect quotations. The anno-
tation scheme was developed to be comparable to
the scheme used in the PARC corpus (Pareti, 2012),
although the SMHC corpus only includes assertions
and does not annotate the lexical cue.
The resulting corpus contains 7,991 quotations
taken from 965 articles from the 2009 Sydney Morn-
ing Herald (we refer to this corpus as SMHC). The
annotations in this corpus also include the speakers
of the quotations, as well as gold standard Named
Entities (NEs). We use 60% of this corpus as train-
ing data (4,872 quotations), 10% as development
data (759 quotations), and 30% as test data (2,360
quotations). Early experiments were conducted over
the development data, while the final results were
trained on both the training and development sets
and were tested on the unseen test data.
3.3 Comparison
Table 2 shows a comparison of the two corpora and
the quotations annotated within them. SMHC has a
higher density of quotations per document, 8.3 vs.
4.6 in PARC, since articles are fully annotated and
1The agreement was calculated using the agr metric de-
scribed in Wiebe and Riloff (2005) as the proportion of com-
monly annotated ARs with respect to the ARs identified overall
by Annotator A and Annotator B respectively

were selected to contain at least one quotation. PARC
is instead only partially annotated and comprises ar-
ticles with no quotations. Excluding null-quotation
articles from PARC, the average incidence of anno-
tated quotations per article raises to 7.1. The corpora
also differ in quotation type distribution, with di-
rect quotations being largely predominant in SMHC
while indirect are more common in PARC.
4 Experimental Setup
4.1 Quotation Extraction
Quotation extraction is the task of extracting the
content span of all of the direct, indirect, and mixed
quotations within a given document. More pre-
cisely, we consider quotations to be acts of com-
munication, which correspond to assertions in Pareti
(2012). Some quotations have content spans that are
split into separate, non-adjacent spans, as in exam-
ple (1a). Ideally the latter span should be marked as
a continuation of a quotation, however we consider
this to be out of scope for this work, so we treat each
span as a separate quotation.
4.2 Preprocessing
As a pre-processing step, both corpora were to-
kenised and POS tagged, and the potential speak-
ers anonymised to prevent over-fitting. We used the
Stanford factored parser (Klein and Manning, 2002)
to retrieve both the Stanford dependencies and the
phrase structure parse. Quotation marks were nor-
malised to a single character, as the quotation di-
rection is often incorrect for multi-paragraph quo-
tations.
4.3 Verb-cue Classifier
Verbs are by far the most common introducer of a
quotation. In PARC verbs account for 96% of all
992
cues, the prepositional phrase according to for 3%,
with the remaining 1% being nouns, adverbials and
prepositional groups. Attributional verbs are not a
closed set, they can vary across styles and genres,
and their attributional use is highly dependent on the
context in which they occur. It is therefore not possi-
ble to simply rely on a pre-compiled list of common
speech verbs. Quotations in PARC are introduced by
232 verb types, 87 of which are unique occurrences.
Not all of the verbs are speech verbs, for example
add, which is the second most frequent after say, or
the manner verb gripe (Ex.1a).
We used the attributional cues in the PARC cor-
pus to develop a separate component of our system
to identify attribution verb-cues. The classifier pre-
dicts whether the head of each verb group is a verb-
cue using the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm,
with k equal to 3. The classifier uses 20 feature
types, including:
• Lexical (e.g. token, lemma, adjacent tokens)
• VerbNet classes membership
• Syntactic (e.g. node-depth in the sentence, par-
ent and sibling nodes)
• Sentence features (e.g. distance from sentence
start/end, within quotation markers).
We compared the system to one baseline, Bsay,
that marks every instance of say as a verb-cue, and
another, Blist, that marks every instance of a verb
that is on the list of 53 verbs presented in Krestel
et al. (2008). We tested the system on the test set for
PARC, which contains 1809 potential verb-cues, of
which 354 are positive and 1455 are negative.
The results in Table 3 show that the verb-cue
classifier can outperform expert-derived knowledge.
The classifier was able to identify verb-cues with P
of 88.9% and R of 72.6%. While frequently oc-
curring verbs are highly predictive, the inclusion of
VerbNet classes (Schuler, 2005) and contextual fea-
tures allows for a more accurate classification of pol-
ysemous and unseen verbs.
Since PARC contains labelled and unlabelled attri-
butions, which is detrimental for training, we used
the verb-cue classifier to identify in the corpus sen-
tences that we suspected contained an unlabelled at-
tribution. Sentences containing a verb classified as a
cue that do not contain a quotation were removed
from the training set for the quotation extraction
model.
4.4 Evaluation
We use two metrics, listed below, for evaluating the
quotation spans predicted by our model against the
gold spans from the annotation.
Strict The first is a strict metric where a predicted
span is only considered to be correct if it exactly
matches a span from the gold standard. The stan-
dard precision, recall, and F -score can be calculated
using this definition of correctness. The drawback of
this strict score is that if a prediction is incorrect by
as little as one token it will be considered completely
incorrect.
Partial We also consider an overlap metric
(Hollingsworth and Teufel, 2005), which allows
partially correct predictions to be proportionally
counted. Precision (P ), recall (R), and F -score for
this method are:
P =
?
g?gold
?
p?pred overlap(g, p)
|pred|
(1)
R =
?
g?gold
?
p?pred overlap(p, g)
|gold|
(2)
F =
2PR
(P + R)
(3)
Where overlap(x, y) returns the proportion of to-
kens of y that are overlapped by x. For each of these
metrics we report the micro-average, as the number
of quotations in each document varies significantly.
When reporting P for the typewise results we re-
strict the set of predicted quotations to only those
with the requisite type, while still considering the
full set of gold quotations. Similarly, when calculat-
ing R we restrict the set of gold quotations to only
those with the required type.
4.5 Baselines
We have developed two baselines inspired by the
current lexical/syntactic pattern-based approaches
in the literature, which combine speech verbs and
hand-crafted rules.
993
Blex Lexical: cue verb + the longest of the spans be-
fore or after it until the sentence boundary.
Bsyn Syntactic: cue verb + verb syntactic object.
Bsyn is close to the model in de La Clergerie
et al. (2011).
Instead of relying on a lexicon of verbs, our base-
lines use those identified by the verb-cue classifier.
As direct quotations are not always explicitly intro-
duced by a cue-verb, we defined a separate baseline
with a rule-based approach (Brule) that returns text
between quotation marks that has at least 3 tokens,
and where the non-stopword and non-proper noun
tokens are not all title cased. In our full results we
apply each method along with Brule and greedily
take the longest predicted spans that do not overlap.
5 Supervised Approaches
We present two supervised approaches to quotation
extraction, which operate over the tokens and the
phrase-structure parse nodes respectively. Despite
the difference in the item being classified, these ap-
proaches have some common features:
Lexical: unigram and bigram versions of the token,
lemma, and POS tags within a window of 5 to-
kens either side of the target, all indexed by po-
sition.
Sentence: features indicating whether the sentence
contains a quotation mark, a NE, a verb-cue, a
pronoun, or any combination of these. There is
also a sentence length feature.
Dependency: relation with parent, relations with
any dependants, as well as versions of these
that include the head and dependent tokens.
External knowledge: position-indexed features for
whether any of the tokens in the sentence match
a known role, organisation, or title. The titles
come from a small hand-built list, while the
role and organisation lists were built by recur-
sively following the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
hyponyms of person and organization respec-
tively.
Other: features for whether the target is within quo-
tation marks, and whether there is a verb-cue
near the end of the sentence.

Table 4: PARC and SMHC results on direct quotations.
The token based approach is trained and tested on all quo-
tations.
5.1 Token-based Approach
The token-based approach treats quotation extrac-
tion as analogous to NE tagging, where there are a
sequence of tokens that need to be individually la-
belled. Each token is given either an I, an O, or a B
label, where B denotes the first token in a quotation,
I denotes the token is inside a quotation, and O indi-
cates that the token is not part of a quotation. For NE
tagging it is common to use a sentence as a single
sequence, as NEs do not cross sentence boundaries.
This does not work for quotations, as they can cross
sentence and even paragraph boundaries. As such,
we treat the entire document as a single sequence,
which allows the predicted quotations to span both
sentence and paragraph bounds.
We use a linear chain Conditional Random Field
(CRF)2 as the learning algorithm, with the common
features listed above, as well as the following fea-
tures:
Verb: features indicating whether the current token
is a (possibly indirect) dependent of a verb-cue,
and another for whether the token is at the start
of a constituent that is a dependent of a verb-
cue.
Ancestor: the labels of all constituents that contain
the current token in their span, indexed by their
depth in the parse tree.
Syntactic: the label, depth, and token span size of
the highest constituent where the current token
is the left-most token in the constituent, as well
as its parent, and whether either of those con-
tains a verb-cue.

this is a combination of the strategy in Blex or Bsyn with the rules for direct quotations. ConstituentG shows the
results for the constituent model using the gold parse.
5.2 Constituent-based Approach
The constituent approach classifies whole phrase
structure nodes as either quotation or not a quota-
tion. Ideally each quotation would match exactly
one constituent, however this is not always the case
in our data. In cases without an exact match we la-
bel every constituent that is a subspan of the quo-
tation as a quotation as long as it has a parent that
is not a subspan of the quotation. In these cases
multiple nodes will be labelled quotation, so a post-
processing step is introduced that rebuilds quota-
tions by merging predicted spans that are adjacent or
overlapping within a sentence. Restricting the merg-
ing process this way loses the ability to predict quo-
tations that cover more than a sentence, but without
this restriction too many predicted quotations are er-
roneously merged.
This approach uses a maximum entropy classi-
fier3 with L1 regularisation. In early experiments
we found that the constituent-based approach per-
formed poorly when trained on all quotations, so for
these experiments the constituent classifier is trained
only on indirect and mixed quotations. The classifier
uses the common features listed above as well as the
following features:
Span: length of the span, features for whether there
is a verb or a NE.
3http://scikit-learn.org/
Node: the label, number of descendants, number of
ancestors, and number of children of the target.
Context: dependency, node, and span features for
the parent and siblings of the target.
In addition the lexical features described earlier
are applied to both the start and end tokens of the
node’s span, as well as the highest token in the de-
pendency parse that is within the span.
6 Results
6.1 Direct Quotations
Table 4 shows the results for predicting direct quota-
tions on PARC and SMHC. In both corpora and with
both metrics the token-based approach outperforms
Brule. Although direct quotations should be trivial
to extract, and a simple system that returns the con-
tent between quotation marks should be hard to beat,
there are two main factors that confound the rule-
based system.
The first is the presence of mixed quotations,
which is most clearly demonstrated in the difference
between the strict precision scores and the partial
precision scores for Brule. Brule will find all of
the directly-quoted portions of mixed quotes, which
do not exactly match a quotation, and so will re-
ceive a low precision score with the strict metric.
However the partial overlap score will reward these

predictions, as they do partially match a quote, so
there is a large difference in those scores. Note that
the reduced strict score does not occur for the token
method, which correctly identifies mixed quotations.
The other main issue is the presence of quotation
marks around items such as book titles and scare
quotes (i.e. text that is in quotation marks to distance
the author from a particular wording or claim). In
Section 4.5 we described the methods that we use to
avoid scare quotes and titles, which are rule-based
and imperfect. While these methods increase the
overall F -score of Brule, they do have a negative
impact on recall, which is why the recall is lower
than might be expected. These results demonstrate
that although direct quotations can be accurately ex-
tracted with rules, the accuracy will be lower than
might be anticipated and the returned spans will in-
clude a number of mixed quotations, which will be
missing some content.
6.2 Indirect and Mixed Quotations
The token approach was also the most effective
method for extracting indirect and mixed quotations
as Tables 5 and 6 show. Indirect quotations were
extracted with strict F -scores of 59% and 60% and
partial F -scores of 76% and 74% in PARC and SMHC
respectively, while mixed quotes were found with
strict F -scores of 56% and 85% and partial F -scores
of 87% and 86%.
Although there is a strong interconnection be-
tween syntax and attribution, results for Bsyn show
that merely considering attribution as a syntactic re-
lation (Skadhauge and Hardt, 2005) has a large im-
pact on recall: only a subset of inter-sentential quo-
tations can be effectively matched by verb comple-
ment boundaries.
The constituent model yielded lower results than
the token one, and in particular it greatly lowered
the recall of mixed quotations in both corpora. Since
the model heavily relies on syntax, it is particularly
affected by errors made by the parser. The conjunc-
tion and in Example 3 is incorrectly attached by the
parser to the cue said, leading the classifier to iden-
tify two separate spans. In order to verify the impact
of incorrect parsing on the model, we ran the con-
stituent model using gold standard parses for PARC.
This resulted in an increase in strict P and increased
the F -score for mixed quotations to 57%, similarly
to the score achieved by the token model. However,
it surprisingly negatively affected R for indirect quo-
tations.
(3) Graeme Hugo, said strong links between Aus-
tralia’s 700,000 ethnic Chinese and China
could benefit both countries and were unlikely
to pose a threat.
The tables also report results for the extraction of
all quotations, irrespective of their type. For this
score, the baseline models for indirect and mixed
quotations are combined with Brule for direct quo-
tations.
6.3 Model Comparison
We designed the features for the token and con-
stituent models to be largely similar. This al-
996
lows us to conclude that the difference in perfor-
mance between the token and constituent models
is largely driven by the class labelling and learn-
ing method. Overall, the token-based approach out-
performed both the baselines and the constituent
method. Qualitatively we found that the token-based
approach was making reasonable predictions most
of the time, but would often fail when a quotation
was attributed to a speaker through a parenthetical
clause, as in Example 4.
(4) Finding lunar ice, said Tidbinbilla’s
spokesman, Glen Nagle, would give a
major boost to NASA’s hopes of returning
humans to the moon by 2020.
The token-based approach has a reasonable bal-
ance of the various label types, and benefits from a
decoding step that allows it to make trade-offs be-
tween good local decisions and a good overall so-
lution. By comparison, the constituent-based ap-
proach has a large class imbalance, as there are many
more negative (i.e. not quotation) parse nodes than
there are positive, which makes finding a good deci-
sion boundary difficult. We experimented with re-
ducing the number of negative nodes to consider,
but found that the overall F -score was equivalent or
worse, largely driven by a drop in recall. We also
found that in many cases the constituent-approach
predicted quotes that were too short, or that were
only the second half of a conjunction, without the
first half being labelled. We expect that these issues
would be corrected with the addition of a decoding
step, that forces the classifier to make a good global
decision.
7 Speaker Attribution
While the focus of this paper is on extracting quota-
tions, we also present results on finding the speaker
of each quotation. As discussed in Section 2, quo-
tation attribution has been addressed in the litera-
ture before, including some work that includes large-
scale data (Elson and McKeown, 2010). However,
the large-scale evaluations that exist cover only di-
rect quotations, whereas we present results for di-
rect, indirect, and mixed quotations.
For this evaluation we use four of the methods that
were introduced in O’Keefe et al. (2012). The first
is a simple rule-based approach (Rule) that returns
the entity closest to the speech verb nearest the quo-
tation, or if there is no such speech verb then the
entity nearest the end of the quotation. The second
method uses a CRF which is able to choose between
up to 15 entities that are in the paragraph containing
the quotation or any preceding it. The third method
(No seq.) is a binary MaxEnt classifier that predicts
whether each entity is the speaker or not the speaker,
with the entity achieving the highest speaker proba-
bility predicted. In O’Keefe et al. (2012) this model
achieved the best results on the direct quotations in
SMHC, despite not using the sequence features or de-
coding methods that were available to other models.
The final method that we evaluate (Gold) is the ap-
proach that uses sequence features that use the gold-
standard labels from previous decisions. As noted
by O’Keefe et al., this method is not realisable in
practise, however we include these results so that
we can reassess the claims of O’Keefe et al. when
direct, indirect, and mixed quotations are included.
For our results to be comparable we use the list of
speech verbs that was presented in Elson and McK-
eown (2010) and used in O’Keefe et al. (2012).
Table 7 shows the accuracy of the two meth-
ods on both PARC and SMHC, broken down by the
type of the quotation. The first observation that
we make about these results in comparison to the
O’Keefe et al. results, is that the accuracy is gener-
ally lower, even for direct quotations. This discrep-
ancy is caused by differences in our data compared
to theirs, notably that the sequence of quotations is
altered in ours by the introduction of indirect quota-
tions, and that some of the direct quotations that they
evaluated would be considered mixed quotations in
our corpora. The rule based method performs par-
ticularly poorly on PARC, which is likely caused by
the relative scarcity of direct quotations and the fact
that it was designed for direct quotations only. Di-
rect quotations are much more frequent in SMHC, so
the rules that rely on the sequence of speakers would
likely perform relatively better than on PARC.
While the approach using gold-standard sequence
features unsurprisingly performed the best, the most
straightforward learned model (No seq.), trained
without any sequence information, equalled or out-
performed the two other non-gold approaches for all
quotation types on both corpora. This indicates that
the CRF model evaluated here was not able to effec-

8 Conclusion
In this work we have presented the first large-scale
experiments on the entire quotation extraction and
attribution task: evaluating the extraction and at-
tribution of direct, indirect and mixed quotations
over two large news corpora. One of these corpora
(SMHC) is a novel contribution of this work, while
our results are the first presented for the other cor-
pus (PARC). This work has shown that while rule-
based approaches that return the object of a speech
verb are indeed effective, they are outperformed by
supervised systems that can take advantage of addi-
tional evidence. We also show that state-of-the-art
quotation attribution methods are less accurate on
indirect and mixed quotations than they are on di-
rect quotations.
Future work will include extending these methods
to extract all attributions, i.e. beliefs, eventualities,
and facts, as well as the source spans. We will also
evaluate the effect of adding a decoding step to the
constituent approach. This work provides an accu-
rate and complete quotation extraction and attribu-
tion system that can be used for a wide range of tasks
in information extraction and opinion mining.
