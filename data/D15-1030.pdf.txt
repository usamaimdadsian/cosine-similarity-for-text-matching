Abstract
A wide range of applications, from social
media to scientific literature analysis, in-
volve graphs in which documents are con-
nected by links. We introduce a topic
model for link prediction based on the in-
tuition that linked documents will tend to
have similar topic distributions, integrat-
ing a max-margin learning criterion and
lexical term weights in the loss function.
We validate our approach on the tweets
from 2,000 Sina Weibo users and evalu-
ate our model’s reconstruction of the so-
cial network.
1 Introduction
Many application areas for text analysis involve
documents connected by links of one or more
types—for example, analysis of scientific pa-
pers (citations, co-authorship), Web pages (hyper-
links), legislation (co-sponsorship, citations), and
social media (followers, mentions, etc.). In this
paper we work within the widely used framework
of topic modeling (Blei et al., 2003, LDA) to de-
velop a model that is simple and intuitive, but
which identifies high quality topics while also ac-
curately predicting link structure.
Our work here is inspired by the phenomenon
of homophily, the tendency of people to associate
with others who are like themselves (McPherson
et al., 2001). As manifested in social networks,
the intuition is that people who are associated with
one another are likely to discuss similar topics, and
vice versa. The new topic model we propose there-
fore takes association links into account so that a
document’s topic distribution is influenced by the
topic distributions of its neighbors. Specifically,
we propose a joint model that uses link structure
to define clusters (cliques) of documents and, fol-
lowing the intuition that documents in the same
cluster are likely to have similar topic distribu-
tions, assigns each cluster its own separate Dirich-
let prior over the cluster’s topic distribution. This
use of priors is consistent with previous work that
has shown document-topic priors to be useful in
encoding various types of prior knowledge and
improving topic modeling performance (Mimno
and McCallum, 2008). We then use distributed
representations to “seed” the topic representations
before getting down to modeling the documents.
Our joint objective function uses a discriminative,
max-margin approach (Zhu et al., 2012; Zhu et
al., 2014) to both model the contents of documents
and produce good predictions of links; in addition,
it improves prediction by including lexical terms
in the decision function (Nguyen et al., 2013).
Our baseline for comparison is the Relational
Topic Model (Chang and Blei, 2010, henceforth
RTM), which jointly captures topics and binary
link indicators in a style similar to supervised
LDA (McAuliffe and Blei, 2008, sLDA), instead
of modeling links alone, e.g., as in the Latent
Multi-group Membership Graph model (Kim and
Leskovec, 2012, LMMG). We also compare our
approach with Daum´e III (2009), who uses docu-
ment links to create a Markov random topic field
(MRTF). Daum´e does not, however, look at link
prediction, as his upstream model (Mimno and
McCallum, 2008) only generates documents con-
ditioned on links. In contrast, our downstream
model allows the prediction of links, like RTM.
Our model’s primary contribution is in its novel
combination of a straightforward joint modeling
approach, max-margin learning, and exploitation
of lexical information in both topic seeding and
regression, yielding a simple but effective model
for topic-informed discriminative link prediction.
Like other topic models which treat binary values
“probabilistically”, our model can convert binary
link indicators into non-zero weights, with poten-
tial application to improving models like Volkova

use of document clusters (pi), the use of words (w)
in the prediction of document links (y), and a max-
margin objective.
et al. (2014), who use neighbor relationships to
improve prediction of user-level attributes.
Our corpus is collected from Sina Weibo with
three types of links between documents. We first
conduct a reality check of our model against LDA
and MRTF and then perform link prediction tasks.
We demonstrate improvements in link prediction
as measured by predictive link rank and provide
both qualitative and quantitative perspectives on
the improvements achieved by the model.
2 Discriminative Links from Topics
Figure 1 is a two-document segment of our model,
which has the following generative process:
1. For each related-document cluster l ? {1, . . . , L}
Draw pil ? Dir(??)
2. For each topic k ? {1, . . . ,K}
(a) Draw word distribution ?k ? Dir(?)

Step 1: Identifying birds of a feather. Prior
to the generative process, given a training set of
documents and document-to-document links, we
begin by identifying small clusters or cliques us-
ing strongly connected components, which auto-
matically determines the number of clusters from
the link graph. Intuitively, documents in the same
clique are likely to have similar topic distributions.
Therefore, each of the L cliques l (the “birds of a
feather” of our title) is assigned a separate Dirich-
let prior pil over K topics.
Step 2a: Using seed words to improve topic
quality. To improve topic quality, we identify
seed words for the K topics using distributed lexi-
cal representations: the key idea is to complement
the more global information captured in LDA-
style topics with representations based on local
contextual information. We cluster the most fre-
quent words’ word2vec representations (Mikolov
et al., 2013) into K word-clusters using the k-
means algorithm, based on the training corpus.
1
We then enforce a one-to-one association between
these discovered word clusters and the K top-
ics. For any word token w
d,n
whose word type
is in cluster k, the associated topic assignment
z
d,n
can only be k. To choose topic k’s seed
words, within its word-cluster we compute each
word w
k,i
’s skip-gram transition probability sum
S
k,i
to the other words as
S
k,i
=
N
k
?
j=1,j 6=i
p(w
k,j
|w
k,i
), (1)
where N
k
denotes the number of words in topic k.
We then select the three words with the highest
sum of transition probabilities as the seed words
for topic k. In the sampling process (Section 3),
seed words are only assigned to their correspond-
ing topics, similar to the use of hard constraints by
Andrzejewski and Zhu (2009).
Steps 2b-3: Link regression parameters.
Given two documents d and d
?
, we want to pre-
dict whether they are linked by taking advantage
of their topic patterns: the more similar two docu-
ments are, the more likely it is that they should be
linked together. Like RTM, we will compute a re-
gression in Step 5 using the topic distributions of
d and d
?
; however, we follow Nguyen et al. (2013)
by also including a document’s word-level distri-
bution as a regression input.

weight vectors for topic-based and lexically-based
predictions, respectively.
Step 4: Generating documents. Documents
are generated as in LDA, where each document’s
topic distribution ? is drawn from the cluster’s
topic prior (a parametric analog to the HDP of Teh
et al. (2006)) and each word’s topic assignment is
drawn from the document’s topic distribution (ex-
cept for seed words, as described above).
Step 5: Generating links. Our model is a
“downstream” supervised topic model, i.e., the
prediction of the observable variable (here, docu-
ment links) is informed by the documents’ topic
distributions, as in sLDA (Blei and McAuliffe,
2007). In contrast to Chang and Blei (2010), who
use a sigmoid as their link prediction function ?,
we instead use hinge loss: the probability ? that
two documents d and d
?
are linked is
p(y

Optimizing topic and lexical regression pa-
rameters. While topic regression parameters ?
and lexical regression parameters ? can be sam-
pled (Zhu et al., 2014), the associated covariance
matrix is huge (approximately 12K × 12K in our
experiments). Instead, we optimize these parame-
ters using L-BFGS.

4 Experimental Results
4.1 Dataset
We crawl data from Sina Weibo, the largest
Chinese micro-blog platform. The dataset con-
tains 2,000 randomly-selected verified users, each
represented by a single document aggregating all
the user’s posts. We also crawl links between pairs
of users when both are in our dataset. Links cor-
respond to three types of interactions on Weibo:
mentioning, retweeting and following.
4
4.2 Perplexity Results
As an initial reality check, we first apply a simpli-
fied version of our model which only uses user in-
teractions for topic modeling and does not predict
links. This permits a direct comparison of our
model’s performance against LDA and Markov
random topic fields (Daum´e III, 2009, MRTF) by
evaluating perplexity.
We set ? = ?
?
= 15 and run the models on
20 topics for all models in this and following sec-
tions. The results are the average values of five
independent runs. Following Daum´e, in each run,
for each document, 80% of its tokens are randomly
selected for training and the remaining 20% are
for test. As the training corpus is generated ran-
domly, seeding is not applied in this section. The
results are given in Table 1, where I- denotes that
the model incorporates user interactions.
The results confirm that our model outperforms
both LDA and MRTF and that its use of user inter-
actions holds promise.

We use ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) for segmentation.
After stopword and low-frequency word removal, the vocab-
ulary includes 12,257 words, with?755 tokens per document
and 5,404 links.

4.3 Link Prediction Results
In this section, we apply our model on link pre-
diction tasks and evaluate by predictive link rank
(PLR). A document’s PLR is the average rank,
among all documents, of the documents to which
it actually links. This means that lower values of
PLR are better.
Figure 2 breaks out the 5-fold cross validation
results and the distinct extensions of RTM.
5
The
results support the value in combining all three
extensions using Lex-IS-MED-RTM, although for
mentioning and retweeting, Lex-IS-MED-RTM
and IS-RTM are quite close.
Applying user interactions does not always pro-
duce improvements. This is because in our in-
trinsic evaluation, we assume that the links on the
test set are not observable and cluster priors are

IS- denotes that the model incorporates user interactions
and seed words, Lex- means that lexical terms were included
in the link probability function (Equation 3), and MED- de-
notes max-margin learning (Zhu et al., 2014; Zhu et al.,
2012). Each type of link is applied separately; e.g., in Fig-
ure 2(a) results are based only on mentioning links, ignoring
retweeting and following links.
not applied. However, according to the training
performance (extrinsic evaluations which we are
still in progress), user interactions do benefit link
prediction performance when links are partially
available, e.g., suggesting more links based on ob-
served links. In contrast, hinge loss and lexical
term weights do not depend on metadata availabil-
ity and generally produce improvements in link
prediction performance.
4.4 Illustrative Example
We illustrate model behavior qualitatively by look-
ing at two test set users, designated A and B.
User A is a reporter who runs “We Media” on
his account, sending news items to followers, and
B is a consultant with a wide range of interests.
Their tweets reveal that both are interested in so-
cial news—a topic emphasizing words like soci-
ety, country, government, laws, leaders, political
party, news, etc. Both often retweet news re-
lated to unfairness in society and local govern-
ment scandals (government, police, leaders, party,
policy, chief secretary). For example, User A
retweeted a report that a person about to be exe-
cuted was unable to take a photo with his family
before his execution, writing I feel heartbroken.
User B retweeted news that a mayor was fired and
investigated because of a bribe; in his retweet, he
expresses his dissatisfaction with what the mayor
did when he was in power. In addition, User A fol-
lows new technology (smart phone, Apple, Sam-
sung, software, hardware, etc.) and B is interested
in food (snacks, noodles, wine, fish, etc.).
As ground truth, there is a mentioning link
from A to B; Table 2 shows this link’s PLR in
the mentioning models, which generally improves
with model sophistication. The mentioning tweet
is a news item that is consistent with the model’s

the social news topic also generally increases as
the models grow more sophisticated.

4.5 Quantitative Analysis
Topic Quality. Automatic coherence detec-
tion (Lau et al., 2014) is an alternative to manual
evaluations of topic quality (Chang et al., 2009).
In each topic, the top n words’ average pointwise
mutual information (PMI)—based on a reference
corpus—serves as a measure of topic coherence.
7
Topic quality improves with user interactions
and max-margin learning (Table 3). PMI drops
when lexical terms are added to the link probabil-
ity function, however. This is consistent with the
role of lexical terms in the model; their purpose
is to improve link prediction performance, not im-
prove topic quality.
Average Regression Value. One way to assess
the quality of link prediction is to compare the
scores of (ground-truth) linked documents to doc-
uments in general. In Table 3, the Average Re-
gression Values show this comparison as a ratio.
The higher the ratio, the more linked document
pairs differ from unlinked pairs, which means that
linked documents are easier to distinguish. This
ratio improves as RTM extensions are added, indi-
cating better link modeling quality.
6
Numerically its proportion is consistently lower for
User A, whose interests are more diverse.
7
We set n = 20 and use a reference corpus of 1,143,525
news items from Sogou Lab, comprising items from June to
July 2012, http://www.sogou.com/labs/dl/ca.
html. Each averages ?347 tokens, using the same segmen-
tation scheme as the experimental corpus.
In the SD/Avg row of Table 3, we also compute
a ratio of standard deviations to mean values. Ra-
tios given by the models with hinge loss are lower
than those not using hinge loss. This means that
the regression values given by the models with
hinge loss are more concentrated around the av-
erage value, suggesting that these models can bet-
ter identify linked pairs, even though the ratio of
linked pairs’ average regression value to all pairs’
average value is lower.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
We introduce a new topic model that takes ad-
vantage of document links, incorporating link in-
formation straightforwardly by deriving clusters
from the link graph and assigning each cluster
a separate Dirichlet prior. We also take advan-
tage of locally-derived distributed representations
to “seed” the model’s latent topics in an informed
way, and we integrate max-margin prediction and
lexical regression to improve link prediction qual-
ity. Our quantitative results show improvements in
predictive link rank, and our qualitative and quan-
titative analysis illustrate that the model’s behavior
is intuitively plausible.
In future work, we plan to engage in further
model analysis and comparison, to explore al-
terations to model structure, e.g. introducing
hierarchical topic models, to use other cluster-
ing methods to obtain priors, and to explore the
value of predicted links for downstream tasks
such as friend recommendation (Pennacchiotti
and Gurumurthy, 2011) and inference of user at-
tributes (Volkova et al., 2014).
