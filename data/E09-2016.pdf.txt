Three BioNLP Tools Powered by a Biological Lexicon 
 
Abstract 
In this paper, we demonstrate three NLP 
applications of the BioLexicon, which is a 
lexical resource tailored to the biology 
domain. The applications consist of a 
dictionary-based POS tagger, a syntactic 
parser, and query processing for biomedical 
information retrieval.  Biological 
terminology is a major barrier to the 
accurate processing of literature within 
biology domain. In order to address this 
problem, we have constructed the 
BioLexicon using both manual and semi-
automatic methods. We demonstrate the 
utility of the biology-oriented lexicon 
within three separate NLP applications. 
1 Introduction 
Processing of biomedical text can frequently be 
problematic, due to the huge number of technical 
terms and idiosyncratic usages of those terms.  
Sometimes, general English words are used in 
different ways or with different meanings in 
biology literature. 
There are a number of linguistic resources 
that can be use to improve the quality of 
biological text processing.  WordNet (Fellbaum, 
1998) and the NLP Specialist Lexicon 1  are 
dictionaries commonly used within biomedical 
NLP. 
WordNet is a general English thesaurus which 
additionally covers biological terms. However, 
since WordNet is not targeted at the biology 
domain, many biological terms and derivational 
relations are missing.   
The Specialist Lexicon is a syntactic lexicon 
of biomedical and general English words, 
providing linguistic information about individual 
vocabulary items (Browne et al., 2003).  Whilst 
it contains a large number of biomedical terms,

its focus is on medical terms. Therefore some 
biology-specific terms, e.g., molecular biology 
terms, are not the main target of the lexicon.  
In response to this, we have constructed the 
BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008), a lexical 
resource tailored to the biology domain.  We will 
demonstrate three applications of the BioLexicon, 
in order to illustrate the utility of the lexicon 
within the biomedical NLP field.  
The three applications are: 
 
• BLTagger: a dictionary-based POS tagger 
based on the BioLexicon 
• Enju full parser enriched by the 
BioLexicon 
• Lexicon-based query processing for 
information retrieval 
2. Summary of the BioLexicon 
In this section, we provide a summary of the 
BioLexicon (Sasaki et al., 2008). It contains 
words belonging to four part-of-speech 
categories: verb, noun, adjective, and adverb.  
Quochi et al.(2008) designed the database 
model of the BioLexicon which follows the 
Lexical Markup Framework (Francopoulo et al., 
2008).    
2.1 Entries in the Biology Lexicon 
The BioLexicon accommodates both general 
English words and terminologies. Biomedical 
terms were gathered from existing biomedical 
databases. Detailed information regarding the 
sources of biomedical terms can be found in  
(Rebholz-Schuhmann et al., 2008). The lexicon 
entries consist of the following: 
 
(1) Terminological verbs: 759 base forms (4,556 
inflections) of terminological verbs with 
automatically extracted verb 
subcategorization frames

(2)Terminological adjectives: 1,258 
terminological adjectives.   
(3) Terminological adverbs: 130 terminological 
adverbs. 
(4) Nominalized verbs: 1,771  nominalized verbs.   
(5) Biomedical terms: Currently, the BioLexicon 
contains biomedical terms in the categories of 
cell (842 entries, 1,400 variants), chemicals 
(19,637 entries, 106,302 variants), enzymes 
(4,016 entries, 11,674 variants), diseases 
(19,457 entries, 33,161 variants), genes and 
proteins (1,640,608 entries, 3,048,920 
variants), gene ontology concepts (25,219 
entries, 81,642 variants), molecular role 
concepts (8,850 entries, 60,408 variants), 
operons (2,672 entries, 3,145 variants), 
protein complexes (2,104 entries, 2,647 
variants), protein domains (16,940 entries, 
33,880 variants), Sequence ontology concepts 
(1,431 entries, 2,326 variants), species 
(482,992 entries, 669,481 variants), and 
transcription factors (160 entries, 795 
variants).   
In addition to the existing gene/protein names, 
70,105 variants of gene/protein names have been 
newly extracted from 15 million MEDLINE 
abstracts. (Sasaki et al., 2008) 
2.2. Comparison to existing lexicons 
This section focuses on the words and 
derivational relations of words that are covered 
by our BioLexicon but not by comparable 
existing resources. Figures 1 and 2 show the 
percentage of the terminological words and 
derivational relations (such as the word 
retroregulate and the derivational relation 
retroregulate ? retroregulation) in our lexicon 
that are also found in WorNet and the Specialist 
Lexicion. 
Since WordNet is not targeted at the biology 
domain, many biological terms and derivational 
relations are not included.   
Because the Specialist Lexicon is a 
biomedical lexicon and the target is broader than 
our lexicon, some biology-oriented words and 
relations are missing.  For example, the 
Specialist Lexicon includes the term retro-
regulator but not retro-regulate. This means that 
derivational relations of retro-regulate are not 
covered by the Specialist Lexicon.  
3. Application 1: BLTagger 
Dictionary-based POS tagging is advantageous 
when a sentence contains technical terms that 
conflict with general English words. If the POS 
tags are decided without considering possible 
occurrences of biomedical terms, then POS 
errors could arise.  
For example, in the protein name “met proto-
oncogene precursor”, met might be incorrectly 
recognized as a verb by a non dictionary-based 
tagger.   
Input sentence: 
“IL-2-mediated activation of …”

In the dictionary, biomedical terms are given 
POS tag "NN-BIOMED". Given a sentence, the 
dictionary-based POS tagger works as follows.  
 
• Find all word sequences that match the 
lexical entries, and create a token graph (i.e., 
trellis) according to the word order.  
• Estimate the score of every path using the 
weights of the nodes and edges, through 
training using Conditional Random Fields.  
• Select the best path. 
 
Figure 3 shows an example of our dictionary-
based POS tagger BLTagger. 
Suppose that the input is “IL-2-mediated 
activation of”. A trellis is created based on the 
lexical entries in the dictionary. The selection 
criteria for the best path are determined by the 
CRF tagging model trained on the Genia corpus 
(Kim et al., 2003). In this example,  
 
IL-2/NN-BIOMED -/- mediated/VVN 
activation/NN of/IN 
 
is selected as the best path.  
Following Kudo et al. (2004), we adapted the 
core engine of the CRF-based morphological 
analyzer, MeCab2, to our POS tagging task.  
The features used were: 
 
• POS 
• BIOMED 
• POS-BIOMED 
• bigram of adjacent POS 
• bigram of adjacent BIOMED 
• bigram of adjacent POS-BIOMED 
 
During the construction of the trellis, white 
space is considered as the delimiter unless 
otherwise stated within dictionary entries. This 
means that unknown tokens are character 
sequences without spaces. 
As the BioLexicon associates biomedical 
semantic IDs with terms, the BLTagger attaches 
semantic IDs to the tokenizing/tagging results. 
4. Application 2: Enju full parser with the 
BioLexicon 
Enju (Miyao, et al., 2003) is an HPSG parser, 
which is tuned to the biomedical domain.  
Sentences are parsed based on the output of the 
                                                 
2 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group 
id=177856/ 
Stepp POS tagger, which is also tuned to the 
biomedical domain. 
To further tune Enju to the biology domain, 
(especially molecular biology), we have 
modified Enju to parse sentences based on the 
output of the BLTagger. 
As the BioLexicon contains many multi-word 
biological terms, the modified version of Enju 
parses token sequences in which some of the 
tokens are multi-word expressions.  This is 
effective when very long technical terms (e.g., 
more than 20 words) are present in a sentence. 
To use the dictionary-based tagging for 
parsing, unknown words should be avoided as 
much as possible. In order to address this issue, 
we added entries in WordNet and the Specialist 
Lexicion to the dictionary of BLTagger. 
The enhancement in the performance of Enju 
based on these changes is still under evaluation. 
However, we demonstrate a functional, modified 
version of Enju. 
5. Application 3: Query processing for IR 
It is sometimes the case that queries for 
biomedical IR systems contain long technical 
terms that should be handled as single multi-
word expressions.  
We have applied BLTagger to the TREC 2007 
Genomics Track data (Hersh et al., 2007).  The 
goal of the TREC Genomics Track 2007 was to 
generate a ranked list of passages for 36 queries 
that relate to biological events and processes.    
Firstly, we processed the documents with a 
conventional tokenizer and standard stop-word 
remover, and then created an index containing 
the words in the documents. Queries are 
processed with the BLTagger and multi-word 
expressions are used as phrase queries.  Passages 
are ranked with Okapi BM25 (Robertson et al., 
1995). 
Table 1 shows the preliminary Mean Average 
Precision (MAP) scores of applying the 
BLTagger to the TREC data set.   
By adding biology multi-word expressions 
identified by the BLTagger to query terms (row 
(a)), we were able to obtain a slightly better 
Passage2 score. As the BLTagger outputs 
semantic IDs which are defined in the 
BioLexicon, we tried to use these semantic IDs 
for query expansion (rows (b) and (d)).  However, 
the MAP scores degraded.

6. Conclusions 
We have demonstrated three applications of the 
BioLexicon, which is a resource comprising 
linguistic information, targeted for use within 
bio-text mining applications.   
We have described the following three 
applications that will be useful for processing of 
biological literature. 
 
• BLTagger: dictionary-based POS tagger 
based on the BioLexicon 
• Enju full parser enriched by the 
BioLexicon 
• Lexicon-based query processing for 
information retrieval 
 
Our future work will include further intrinsic 
and extrinsic evaluations of the BioLexicon in 
NLP, including its  application to information 
extraction tasks in the biology domain. The 
BioLexicon is available for non-commercial 
purposes under the Creative Commons license.
