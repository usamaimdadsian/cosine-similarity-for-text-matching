Abstract
Previous approaches to the problem of
measuring similarity between automati-
cally generated topics have been based on
comparison of the topics’ word probability
distributions. This paper presents alterna-
tive approaches, including ones based on
distributional semantics and knowledge-
based measures, evaluated by compari-
son with human judgements. The best
performing methods provide reliable esti-
mates of topic similarity comparable with
human performance and should be used in
preference to the word probability distri-
bution measures used previously.
1 Introduction
Topic models (Blei et al., 2010) have proved to be
useful for interpreting and organising the contents
of large document collections. It seems intuitively
plausible that some automatically generated topics
will be similar while others are dis-similar. For ex-
ample, a topic about basketball (team game james
season player nba play knicks coach league) is
more similar to a topic about football (world cup
team soccer africa player south game match goal)
than one about the global finance (fed financial
banks federal reserve bank bernanke rule crisis
credit). Methods for automatically determining
the similarity between topics have several poten-
tial applications, such as analysis of corpora to de-
termine topics being discussed (Hall et al., 2008)
or within topic browsers to decide which topics
should be shown together (Chaney and Blei, 2012;
Gretarsson et al., 2012; Hinneburg et al., 2012).
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003) is a popular type of topic model but can-
not capture such correlations unless the seman-
tic similarity between topics is measured. Other
topic models, such as the Correlated Topic Model
(CTM) (Blei and Lafferty, 2006), overcome this
limitation and identify correlations between top-
ics.
Approaches to identifying similar topics for a
range of tasks have been described in the litera-
ture but they have been restricted to using informa-
tion from the word probability distribution to com-
pare topics and have not been directly evaluated.
Word distributions have been compared using a
variety of measures such as KL-divergence (Li and
McCallum, 2006; Wang et al., 2009; Newman et
al., 2009), cosine measure (He et al., 2009; Ram-
age et al., 2009) and the average Log Odds Ratio
(Chaney and Blei, 2012). Kim and Oh (2011) also
applied the cosine measure and KL-Divergence
which were compared with four other measures:
Jaccard’s Coefficient, Kendall’s ? coefficient, Dis-
count Cumulative Gain and Jensen Shannon Di-
vergence (JSD).
This paper compares a wider range of ap-
proaches to measuring topic similarity than pre-
vious work. In addition these measures are eval-
uated directly by comparing them against human
judgements.
2 Measuring Topic Similarity
We compare measures based on word probability
distributions (Section 2.1), distributional semantic
methods (Sections 2.2-2.4), knowledge-based ap-
proaches (Section 2.5) and their combination (Sec-
tion 2.6).
2.1 Topic Word Probability Distribution
We first experimented with measures based on
comparison of the topics’ word distributions (see
Section 1), by applying the JSD, KL-divergence
and Cosine approaches and the Log Odds Ratio
(Chaney and Blei, 2012).
22
2.2 Topic Model Semantic Space
The semantic space generated by the topic model
can be used to represent the topics and the topic
words. By definition each topic is a probability
distribution over the words in the training corpus.
For a corpus with D documents and V words, a
topic model learns a relation between words and
topics, T , as a T ×V matrix,W, that indicates the
probability of each word in each topic. W is the
topic model semantic space and each topic word
can be represented as a vector, V
i
, with topics as
features weighted by the probability of the word
in each topic. The similarity between two topics
is computed as the average pairwise cosine sim-
ilarity between their top-10 most probable words
(TS-Cos).
2.3 Reference Corpus Semantic Space
Topic words can also be represented as vectors
in a semantic space constructed from an external
source. We adapt the method proposed by Aletras
and Stevenson (2013) for measuring topic coher-
ence using distributional semantics
1
.
Top-N Features A semantic space is con-
structed considering only the top n most frequent
words in Wikipedia (excluding stop words) as con-
text features. Each topic word is represented as a
vector of n features weighted by computing the
Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) (Church and
Hanks, 1989) between the topic word and each
context feature, PMI(w
i
, w
j
)
?
. ? is a variable for
assigning more importance to higher PMI values.
In our experiments, we set ? = 3 and found that
the best performance is obtained for n = 5000.
Similarity between two topics is defined as the av-
erage cosine similarity of the topic word vectors
(RCS-Cos-N).
Topic Word Space Alternatively, we consider
only the top-10 topic words from the two topics
as context features to generate topic word vectors.
Then, topic similarity is computed as the pairwise
cosine similarity of the topic word vectors (RCS-
Cos-TWS).
Word Association Topic similarity can also be
computed by applying word association measures
directly. Newman et al. (2010) measure topic
coherence as the average PMI between the topic
words. This approach can be adapted to measure

Wikipedia is used as a reference corpus to count word
co-occurrences and frequencies using a context window of
±10 words centred on a topic word.
topic similarity by computing the average pairwise
PMI between the topic words in two topics (PMI).
2.4 Training Corpus Semantic Space
Term-Document Space A matrixX can be cre-
ated using the training corpus. Each term (row)
represents a topic word vector. Element x
ij
in X
is the tf.idf of the term i in document j. Topic
similarity is computed as the pairwise cosine sim-
ilarity of the topic word vectors (TCS-Cos-TD).
Word Co-occurrence in Training Documents
Alternatively, we generate a matrix Z of co-
document frequencies. The matrix Z consists of
V rows and columns representing the V vocab-
ulary words. Element z
ij
is the log of the num-
ber of documents that contains the words i and
j normalised by the document frequency, DF, of
the word j. Mimno et al. (2011) introduced that
metric to measure topic coherence. We adapted
it to estimate topic similarity by aggregating the
co-document frequency of the words between two
topics (Doc-Co-occ).
2.5 Knowledge-based Methods
UKB (Agirre et al., 2009) is used to generate a
probability distribution over WordNet synsets for
each word in the vocabulary V of the topic model
using the Personalized PageRank algorithm. The
similarity between two topic words is calculated
by transforming these distributions into vectors
and computing the cosine metric. The similar-
ity between two topics is computed by measur-
ing pairwise similarity between their top-10 topic
words and selecting the highest score.
Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) proposed by
Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) transforms
the topic keywords into vectors that consist of
Wikipedia article titles weighted by their relevance
to the keyword. For each topic, the centroid is
computed from the keyword vectors. Similarity
between topics is computed as the cosine similar-
ity of the ESA centroid vectors.
2.6 Feature Combination Using SVR
We also evaluate the performance of a support
vector regression system (SVR) (Vapnik, 1998)
with a linear kernel using a combination of ap-
proaches described above as features
2
. The system
is trained and tested using 10-fold cross validation.
2
With the exception of JSD, features based on the topics’
word probability distributions were not used by SVR since it
was found that including them reduced performance.
23
3 Evaluation
Data We created a data set consisting of pairs of
topics generated by two topic models (LDA and
CTM) over two document collections using differ-
ent numbers of topics. The first consists of 47,229
news articles from New York Times (NYT) in the
GigaWord corpus and the second contains 50,000
articles from ukWAC (Baroni et al., 2009). Each
article is tokenised then stop words and words ap-
pearing fewer than five times in the corpora re-
moved. This results in a total of 57,651 unique to-
kens for the NYT corpus and 72,672 for ukWAC.
LDA Topics are learned by training LDA mod-
els over the two corpora using gensim
3
. The num-
ber of topics is set to T = 50, 100, 200 and hy-
perparameters, ? and ?, are set to
1
T
. Randomly
selecting pairs of topics will result to a data set
in which the majority of pairs would not be simi-
lar. We overcome that problem by assuming that
the JSD between likely relevant pairs will be low
while it will be higher for less relevant pairs of
topics. We selected 800 pairs of topics. 600 pairs
represent topics with similar word distributions (in
the top 6 most relevant topics ranked by JSD). The
remaining 200 pairs were selected randomly.
CTM is trained using the EM algorithm
4
. The
number of topics to learn is set to T =
50, 100, 200 and the rest of the settings are set to
their default values. The topic graph generated by
CTM was used to create all the possible pairs be-
tween topics that are connected. This results in a
total of 70, 468 and 695 pairs in NYT, and a total
of 80, 246 and 258 pairs in ukWAC for the 50, 100
and 200 topics respectively.
Incoherent topics are removed using an ap-
proach based on distributional semantics (Aletras
and Stevenson, 2013). Each topic is represented
using the top 10 words with the highest marginal
probability.
Human Judgements of Topic Similarity were
obtained using an online crowdsourcing platform,
Crowdflower. Annotators were provided with
pairs of topics and were asked to judge how simi-
lar the topics are by providing a rating on a scale of
0 (completely unrelated) to 5 (identical). The av-
erage response for each pair was calculated in or-
der to create the final similarity judgement for use
as a gold-standard. The average Inter-Annotator

agreement (IAA) across all pairs for all of the col-
lections is in the range of 0.53-0.68. The data set
together with gold-standard annotations is freely
available
5
.
4 Results
Table 1 shows the correlation (Spearman) between
the topic similarity metrics described in Section 2
and average human judgements for the LDA and
CTM topic pairs. It also shows the performance
of a Word Overlap baseline which measures the
number of terms that two topics have in common
normalised by the total number of topic terms.
The correlations obtained using the topics’
word probability distributions (Section 2.1), i.e.
JSD, KL-divergence and Cos, are comparable with
the baseline for all of the topic collections and
topic models. The metric proposed by Chaney
and Blei (2012) also compares probability distri-
butions and fails to perform well on either data
set. These results suggest that these metrics may
be sensitive to the high dimensionality of the vo-
cabulary. They also assign high similarity to top-
ics that contain ambiguous words, resulting in low
correlations with human judgements.
Performance of the cosine of the word vec-
tor (TS-Cos) in the Topic Model Semantic Space
(Section 2.2) varies implying that the quality of the
latent space generated by LDA and CTM is sensi-
tive to the number of topics.
The similarity metrics that use the reference
corpus (Section 2.3) consistently produce good
correlations for topic pairs generated using both
LDA and CTM. The best overall correlation for a
single feature in most cases is obtained using av-
erage PMI (in a range of 0.43-0.74). The perfor-
mance of the distributional semantic metric using
the Topic Word Space (RCS-Cos-TWS) is com-
parable and slightly lower for the top-N features
(RCS-Cos-N). This indicates that the reference
corpus covers a broader range of semantic subjects
than the latent space produced by the topic model.
When the term-document matrix from the train-
ing corpus is used as a vector space (Section 2.4)
performance is worse than when the reference
corpus is used. In addition, using co-document
frequency derived from the training corpus does
not correlate particularly well with human judge-
ments. These methods are sensitive to the size
of the corpus, which may be too small to gener-

ESA, one of the knowledge-based methods
(Section 2.5), performs well and is comparable to
(or in some cases better than) PMI. UKB does
not perform particularly well because the topics
often contain named entities that do not exist in
WordNet. ESA is based on Wikipedia and does
not suffer from this problem. Overall, metrics for
computing topic similarity based on rich semantic
resources (e.g. Wikipedia) are more appropriate
than metrics based on the topic model itself be-
cause of the limited size of the training corpus.
Combining the features using SVR gives the
best overall result for LDA (in the range 0.46-
0.75) and CTM (0.60-0.72). However, the fea-
ture combination performs slightly lower than the
best single feature in two cases when CTM is
used (T=200, NYT and T=50, ukWAC). Analy-
sis of the coefficients produced by the SVR in
each fold demonstrated that including JSD and
the Word Overlap reduce SVR performance. We
repeated the experiments by removing these fea-
tures
6
which resulted in higher correlations (0.64
and 0.65 respectively).
Another interesting observation is that using
LDA the correlations of the various similarity met-

rics with human judgements increase with the
number of topics for both corpora. This result
is consistent with the findings of Stevens et al.
(2012) that topic model coherence increases with
the number of topics. Fewer topics makes the task
of identifying similar topics more difficult because
it is likely that they will contain some terms that do
not relate to the topic’s main subject. Correlations
in CTM are more stable for different number of
topics because of the nature of the model, the pairs
have been generated using the topic graph which
by definition contains correlated topics.
5 Conclusions
We explored the task of determining the similar-
ity between pairs of automatically generated top-
ics and described a range of approaches to the
problem. We constructed a data set of pairs of
topics generated by two topic models, LDA and
CTM, together with human judgements of simi-
larity. The data set was used to evaluate a wide
range of approaches. The most interesting finding
is the poor performance of the metrics based on
word probability distributions previously used for
this task. Our results demonstrate that word asso-
ciation measures, such as PMI, and state-of-the-art
textual similarity metrics, such as ESA, are more
appropriate.
