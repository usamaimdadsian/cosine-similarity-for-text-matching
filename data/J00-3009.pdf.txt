1. Overview 
The MIT Encyclopedia ofthe Cognitive Sciences (MITECS) brings together 471 brief articles 
on a very wide range of topics within cognitive science. The general editors worked 
with advisory editors in six contributing fields, including Gennaro Chierchia on Lin- 
guistics and Language and Michael I. Jordan and Stuart Russell on Computational 
Intelligence. MITECS opens with excellent overview articles by each of the advisory 
editors on their fields. 
The general quality of the contributors and their contributions is outstanding. The 
editors secured the cooperation of leading scientists in every area including compu- 
tational inguistics. Tables 1 and 2 suggest articles that are of particular interest in 
computational linguistics. The division into sections is that of the book's companion 
Web site; 1 in the printed volume, the articles are arranged in a single alphabetical 
sequence. 
There are many other articles of immediate interest, including several on gram- 
mar models popular in CL (Mark Steedman on Categorial Grammar, Georgia Green 
on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar, and Mary Dalrymple on Lexical Func- 
tional Grammar) and several that treat computational simulations of psycholinguistic 
phenomena. Dennis Norris's general article on computational psycholinguistics fo- 
cuses nicely on interdisciplinary issues; it motivates why a range of computational 
models remain interesting within cognitive science when language is the subject of 
investigation. 
2. Cognitive Science or Cognitive Sciences? 
It is noteworthy that the editors do not attempt a general overview article on cognitive 
science, and that MITECS promises information on the cognitive sciences (plural). This 
suggests a fragmented view of the field, which, coming from its greatest authorities, 
must be taken seriously. It is also reflected in the relatively little attention paid to 
specifically cognitive issues in many of the articles (for example, the articles on Infor-

mation Theory, Inductive Logic Programming, Pattern Recognition and Feed-forward 
Networks, and others all have little or nothing to say about specific applications within 
cognitive science). Hector Levesque's article on Computational Complexity and Judea 
Pearl's article on Bayesian Networks are notable xceptions: both consider the impli- 
cations for cognitive science xplicitly. It is easy to understand the editorial decision 
to look to the major authorities on specific subjects and techniques rather than to 
researchers who have emphasized application to issues of cognitive structure and 
processing, but it reinforces the view of cognitive science as fragmented, perhaps im- 
mature. 
3. Computational Linguistics 
The CL articles may all be recommended. They will not serve professional computa- 
tional inguists directly, but rather students in computational linguistics and colleagues 
in allied fields who wish to get an idea of what CL is. One nonetheless gets the impres- 
sion that CL fared suboptimally in the division of labor among the editors. To take 
one obvious example, the articles on Computational Linguistics (by Aravind Joshi 
in the section "Language and Linguistics") and on Natural Language Processing (by 
James Allen in the section "Computational Intelligence") take little note of each other. 
The article on CL mentions NLP as an alternative name for our field without, how- 
ever, referring to the other article (in the fashion MITECS uses elsewhere). The NLP 
article in turn discusses Machine Translation with no reference to the full article by 
Hovy.

Book Reviews 
If computational linguistics focuses on language from a computational perspec- 
tive (my favorite brief definition), then we might expect he Chomsky hierarchy of 
languages and automata, together with their processing properties, to figure somehow 
centrally, but this topic falls through the cracks. Arbib's article is extremely general, for 
example explaining finite automata nd regular languages ("finite-state languages") 
only as control mechanisms for Turing machines. The applicability of finite automata 
to phonology and morphology gets no mention. Stabler's article on formal grammars 
is interesting, but focuses on very general questions about he relation between human 
language and formal models, in particular about the sorts of idealizations common in 
work on formal language theory inspired by human language. 
MITECS naturally reflects the impact that CL has on its scholarly neighbors in 
cognitive science. It is gratifying to see CL acknowledged on the one hand in articles 
on computation, for example in Bernhard Nebel's piece on Frame-Based Systems, and 
on the other hand in articles on language, for example in Craige Roberts's article on 
Discourse. Such references suggest cross-pollination of the sort that interdisciplinary 
activity is meant to promote. 
If MITECS may be taken as a reliable guide, however, then CL has limited impact 
on cognitive science. Paul Gorrell's article on Sentence Processing might be expected 
to attend to some of the work done on parsing in computational linguistics, but does 
not. He mentions the Marcus parser and psycholinguistic work by Steedman in the 
(miscited) volume edited by Dowty, Karttunen and Zwicky (1985), but ignores a com- 
putational contribution there by Pereira (1985). There is no mention of incremental 
processing, which Steedman (1990), Joshi (1990), Pereira and Pollack (1991), Shieber 
and Johnson (1993), Nerbonne (1996), and others have written on. Tanenhaus and 
Sedivy's article on ambiguity might be expected to teem with references to the disam- 
biguation problem that has arguably been a major focus of CL over the past 20 years. 
The article acknowledges only that ambiguity is a "central problem" in CL and is con- 
tent to refer only to Allen (1995). There is no reason to doubt Gorrell's or Tanenhaus 
and Sedivy's scholarship; rather, it suggests rather that CL work has little influence 
on cognitive science of this sort. 
Several articles report on psycholinguistic simulations that are taken to embody 
hypotheses about human processing--for example, Norris's article (mentioned above), 
and the two articles by Anne Cutler. These suggest points at which computational 
linguists might profitably play a more active role. Computational models already exist 
that account for human behavior with respect o recognition time, error as a function 
of word frequency and similarity, and several other parameters that normally play no 
role in core CL. These additional parameters might serve as interesting data from a 
purely computational view. This sort of work is reported on by Dijkstra and de Smedt 
(1996), but is not found (much) at ACL or similar conferences. MITECS suggests that 
it is an interesting path to pursue further. It includes a nice pair of papers by Rick 
Lewis and James McClelland on more general issues of symbolic versus comlectionist 
cognitive modeling. 
4. Developments 
MITECS includes further sections "Neuroscience" and "Culture, Cognition, and Evolu- 
tion." The former normally receives routine but less inspired attention in introductory 
texts, but is an equal partner here. It is an area in which an interesting rapproche- 
ment with psychology and psycholinguistics i  underway, to judge from contribu- 
tions in this volume (articles on Object Recognition by Martha Farah, Aphasia by 
David Swinney, and Dyslexia by Albert Galaburda; a series of articles on the Neural 
465 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 3 
Bases of Grammar by David Caplan, Language by Nina Dronkers, Lexicon by Alfonso 
Caramazza, and Phonology by Sheila Blumstein; and an article on Sign Language and 
the Brain by David Corina). 
Culture, cognition, and evolution is not a topic normally included in introduc- 
tory texts on cognitive science, but may provide a fruitful perspective from which 
to examine the current emphasis on "empiricist" methods in CL. The emphasis on 
general data analysis techniques (as opposed to specifically linguistic methods) in 
data-intensive CL may find its psychological counterpart in the emphasis on the rich 
culture within which verbal activity is learned. Whether or not that seems plausible, 
Stephen Levinson's article on Language and Culture is a useful modern perspective 
on the issue of how culture, cognition, and language might be seen to interrelate. 
5. Recommendat ion 
Naturally, there are variations in style and quality in the articles, but on the whole they 
are very good. More importantly for some purposes, the level at which the articles are 
written is a bit uneven. Most articles will be accessible to advanced undergraduates in 
any of the federated fields, but certainly not the articles on Bayesian Learning, Control 
Theory, Statistical Learning Theory, Unsupervised Learning, and several others, all of 
which rely on terse mathematical presentations. 
The book is technically adequate: it is surprisingly sober, including relatively few 
diagrams, charts, tables, or photos. An interesting article on Meter in Poetry by Jay 
Keyser is marred by poor typesetting. Invaluable on the other hand, are the bibliogra- 
phies at the ends of the articles. These appear to have enjoyed special attention, and 
include very recent and, in general, very useful material. Only very occasionally do 
we find contributors lapsing into references to "(unpublished)", (ms.)", or the like. 
MITECS is to be recommended to all libraries and to researchers in computa- 
tional linguistics interested in cognitive science, especially those interested in how the 
fields of linguistics, computation, and psychology might cooperate more effectively in 
understanding language.
