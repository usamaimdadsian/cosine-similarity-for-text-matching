Abstract
Cross-document co-reference resolution
(CCR) computes equivalence classes over
textual mentions denoting the same entity
in a document corpus. Named-entity link-
ing (NEL) disambiguates mentions onto
entities present in a knowledge base (KB)
or maps them to null if not present in
the KB. Traditionally, CCR and NEL have
been addressed separately. However, such
approaches miss out on the mutual syn-
ergies if CCR and NEL were performed
jointly.
This paper proposes C3EL, an unsuper-
vised framework combining CCR and NEL
for jointly tackling both problems. C3EL
incorporates results from the CCR stage
into NEL, and vice versa: additional global
context obtained from CCR improves the
feature space and performance of NEL,
while NEL in turn provides distant KB fea-
tures for already disambiguated mentions
to improve CCR. The CCR and NEL steps
are interleaved in an iterative algorithm that
focuses on the highest-confidence still un-
resolved mentions in each iteration. Ex-
perimental results on two different corpora,
news-centric and web-centric, demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art base-
lines for both CCR and NEL.
1 Introduction
With the advent of large knowledge bases (KB)
like DBpedia, YAGO, Freebase, and others, enti-
ties (people, places, organizations, etc.) along with
their attributes and relationships form the basis of
smart applications like search, analytics, recom-
mendations, question answering, and more. The
major task that arises in both the KB construc-
tion process and the entity-centric applications in-
volves precise recognition, resolution, and link-
ing of named entities distributed across web pages,
news articles, and social media.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) deals with the
identification of entity mentions in a text and their
classification into coarse-grained semantic types
(person, location, etc.) (Finkel et al., 2005; Nadeau
& Sekine, 2007; Ratinov & Roth, 2009). This in-
volves segmentation of token sequences to obtain
mention boundaries, and mapping relevant token
spans to pre-defined entity categories. For exam-
ple, NER on the text Einstein won the Nobel
Prize identifies the mentions “Einstein” and “No-
bel Prize” and marks them as person and misc type,
respectively.
Named Entity Linking (NEL)
1
involves the dis-
ambiguation of textual mentions, based on context
and semantic information, and their mapping to
proper entities in a KB (Bunescu & Pas¸ca, 2006;
Cucerzan, 2007; Milne & Witten, 2008; Hoffart
et al., 2011; Ratinov et al., 2011; Cornolti et al.,
2013). For example, in the above text, the mention
“Einstein” is linked to the physicist Albert Einstein.
Entity Co-reference Resolution (CR) (Haghighi
& Klein, 2010; Ng, 2010; Lee et al., 2013) is
essentially a clustering task to identify mentions
(and anaphoras) within a document referring to the
same entity, thus computing equivalence classes or
mention groups. For example, mentions Albert
Einstein and Nobel laureate Einstein both
refer to the same entity German physicist Albert
Einstein, but are different from the mention Hans
Albert Einstein.
When CR is extended to an entire text cor-
pus, in order to generate equivalence classes of
co-referring mentions across documents, the task
is known as Cross-document Co-reference Resolu-
tion (CCR) (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998; Culotta et
al., 2007; Singh et al., 2011; Dutta & Weikum,
2015). Note that CCR is not the same as merely
concatenating all documents in the corpus and uti-
lizing existing CR methods. The linguistic diver-
sity across documents and high computational cost
for huge numbers of mentions in the corpus would
typically make such a CR-based simulation per-
form poorly. Neither CR nor CCR links mention
groups to corresponding KB entities. Thus, they
represent both in-KB entities and out-of-KB enti-
ties (e.g., long-tail or emerging entities that do not
have a Wikipedia article) in the same way.
1
Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) and “Wikification”
are often used to denote the same task. The latter may be more
broadly used, though, to include the disambiguation of com-
mon nouns and phrases onto concepts, whereas NED restricts
itself to noun phrases that denote individual entities.
846
State-of-the-Art and its Limitations: Established
CR methods rely on rule-based methods or super-
vised learning techniques on syntactic paths be-
tween mentions, semantic compatibility, and other
linguistic features (Haghighi & Klein, 2009), with
additional use of distant features from KBs (Lee
et al., 2013). Modern cluster-ranking (Rahman
& Ng, 2011) and multi-sieve methods (Ratinov
& Roth, 2012) involve incremental expansion of
mention groups by considering semantic types
and Wikipedia categories. CCR methods utilize
transitivity-aware clustering techniques (Singh et
al., 2011), by considering mention-mention sim-
ilarities (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998) along with
features extracted from external KBs (Dutta &
Weikum, 2015).
NEL methods often harness the semantic sim-
ilarity between mentions and entities and also
among candidate entities for different mentions (in
Wikipedia or other KBs) for contextualization and
coherence disambiguation (Hoffart et al., 2011;
Milne & Witten, 2008; Kulkarni et al., 2009; Rati-
nov et al., 2011). However, in the absence of
CR mention groups, NEL has limited context and
is bound to miss out on certain kinds of difficult
cases.
Although NER, CR, CCR and NEL involve
closely related tasks and their tighter integration
has been shown to be promising (Chen & Roth,
2013; Zheng et al., 2013), they have mostly been
explored in isolation. Recently, several joint mod-
els have been proposed for CR-NER (Haghighi &
Klein, 2010; Singh et al., 2013), CR-NEL (Hajishirzi
et al., 2013), and NER-CR-NEL (Durrett & Klein,
2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no
method exists for jointly handling CCR and NEL
on large text corpora.
1.1 Approach and Contributions
This paper proposes the novel C3EL (Cross-
doCument Co-reference resolution and Entity
Linking) framework for jointly modeling cross-
document co-reference resolution (CCR) and link-
age of mention groups to entities in a knowledge
base (NEL).
Example: To illustrate the potential synergies
between CCR and NEL, consider the 3 docu-
ments in Figure 1 containing 9 mentions (on the
left) with candidate entities from a KB (on the
right). CCR alone would likely miss the co-
reference relation between Logan (Doc 1) and its
alias Wolverine (Doc 2), leaving NEL with the
difficult task of disambiguating “Logan” in a doc-
ument with sparse and highly ambiguous context
(Doc 1). On the other hand, NEL alone would
likely map Australia (Doc 3) to the country (not
the movie) and could easily choose the wrong link
for mention “Hugh”. Moreover, the presence of
Ava Eliot as an out-of-KB mention complicates
the task.
However, if we could more freely interleave

Input Corpus
Figure 1: Joint CCR-NEL Example (Green KB en-
tries connected via arrows denote the correct entity linkage for
the mention co-reference groups; while the red ones represent
alternative incorrect candidates with similar surface forms)
CCR and NEL and could iterate them several
times, we would be in a much stronger position.
An initial NEL step for the easiest mention, namely
“Wolverine”, maps it to the character of X-Men
movies. This indicates that the three “Hugh” men-
tions could all be the same actor, and are thus eas-
ily merged into a co-reference group using CCR.
We now have enough cues for NEL to choose the
right entity for the “Hugh” mention group, which
in turn enables the proper mapping of “Australia”
to the movie. Finally, it becomes clear that men-
tions “Ava Eliot” and “his daughter Ava” should be
merged into the same group and represented as an
out-of-KB entity mapped to null.
The above example clearly demonstrates that
interleaving CCR and NEL is highly beneficial.
However, appropriate choices for the ordering of
CCR and NEL steps are usually not obvious at all.
The proposed C3EL algorithm solves this prob-
lem: automatically determining an efficient inter-
leaving of CCR and NEL.
Approach: C3EL iteratively aggregates interme-
diate information obtained from alternating steps
of CCR and NEL, thus forming a feedback loop
for propagating mention features and entity knowl-
edge. Intuitively, co-referring mentions obtained
via CCR generate global context for improved
NEL performance, while mentions linked to KB
entities (by NEL) provide distant semantic features
with additional cues for CCR. C3EL couples sev-
eral building blocks like unsupervised hierarchi-
cal clustering, context summaries for mentions and
distant KB features for entities, drawing inspiration
from the CCR-only method of (Dutta & Weikum,
2015). Mention linking to the KB (NEL) is per-
formed using distant knowledge and co-occurring
mentions.
In a nutshell, the major contributions of this pa-
per are:
• the C3EL framework for joint computation of
cross-document co-reference resolution (CCR)
and entity linking to a KB (NEL), based on
propagating information across iterative CCR
and NEL steps;
• techniques for considering co-occurring men-
tions in context summaries and for harnessing
847
context-based keywords for link validation in
NEL, improving accuracy on out-of-KB enti-
ties;
• an experimental evaluation with two different
corpora, one based on news articles and one
based on web pages, demonstrating substantial
gains for both CCR and NEL over state-of-the-
art methods.
2 C3EL: Joint CCR-NEL Framework
Given an input corpus C of n documents, C =
{D
1
, D
2
, · · · , D
n
} with entity mentions EM =
{m
11
,m
12
, · · · ,m
21
,m
22
, · · · } (m
ij
? D
i
),
C3EL aims to jointly compute:
• CCR: an equivalence relation over EM with
equivalence classesE
i
, such thatE
i
?
i 6=j
E
j
=
? and ?
i
E
i
= EM , and
• NEL: linking each of the classes E
i
to entities
present in a KB or map it to null if there is no
proper entity in the KB.
To this end, C3EL consists of 3 algorithmic
stages: (i) Pre-Processing, (ii) Interleaved NEL and
CCR, and (iii) Finalization.
2.1 Pre-Processing Stage
HTML pages in the input corpusC are transformed
into plain text using standard tools like jsoup.
org. Recognition and markup of mentions are per-
formed using the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit (nlp.
stanford.edu), and a coarse-grained lexical
type for each mention (e.g., person, location, orga-
nization, etc.) is obtained from the Stanford NER
Tagger (Finkel et al., 2005). The multi-pass sieve
algorithm for single-document CR (Raghunathan
et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013) then
computes mention co-reference chains per docu-
ment, and a head mention is chosen for each of the
mention groups (chains). The head mention is typ-
ically represented by the most explicit denotation
of the entity (e.g., person’s full name with title, lo-
cation name with country, etc.).
For each of the mention groups M
i
, C3EL then
constructs a context summary using:
• Sentences – all sentences in the document that
contain mentions of group M
i
; and
• Co-occurrence – all sentences for other men-
tion groups that contain mentions co-occurring
in any of the sentences of M
i
(as obtained
above).
Formally, for each mention groupM
i
, let S(M
i
) =
{sentence(m
j
) |m
j
? M
i
} represent the set
of extracted sentences, where sentence(m
j
) de-
notes the sentences in which mention m
j
occurs.
Also, let the co-occurring mention set of M
i
be
Co(M
i
) = {m
?
|m
?
? S(M
i
) ? m
?
/? M
i
}. The
context summary of M
i
is defined as:
CS(M
i
) = S(M
i
) ?
?
?
?
m
?
?Co(M
i
)
S(m
?
)
?
?
The context summaries intentionally do not in-
clude any distant KB features for mentions. The
intuition is to minimize potential noise from overly
speculative mappings to the KB at this initial stage.
2.2 Interleaved NEL & CCR Approach
After the preliminary CR step on each document
and the construction of context summaries, C3EL
now performs an initial NEL step for each of the
mention groups M
i
, using the extracted sentences
S(M
i
) as inputs to NEL. It obtains the best match-
ing entity, the confidence of the match, and its
corresponding Wikipedia page. Off-the-shelf NEL
software (like WikipediaMiner or Illinois-Wikifier)
is used for mention-entity mapping based on prior
popularity of the named-entities (from the KB) and
textual similarity between S(M
i
) (context of the
mention group) and the entity descriptions in KB.
For each M
i
, the entity link obtained (from
NEL) is then “validated” using a similarity mea-
sure between features from the context summary,
CS(M
i
) (including co-occurring mentions) and
distant KB labels – forming the link validation pro-
cedure of C3EL. This explicit use of co-occurring
mentions’ (Co(M
i
)) contexts helps to better iden-
tify out-of-KB entities compared to direct full-
fledged NEL using the entire input text (shown in
Section 3). Also the use of NEL on S(M
i
) alone,
makes C3EL “light-weighted”.
The mappings between the mention groups and
KB entries are then classified, on the basis of
the NEL confidence scores, into Strong Evidence
(SE), Weak Evidence (WE), and No Evidence (NE)
classes. For mention groups placed in SE, the
KB features (obtained previously) are appended to
their context summaries, while mentions strongly
linked to same KB entities are considered to be co-
referring and hence grouped together (performing
implicit CCR).
Considering our example (Figure 1), we now
outline the iterative steps of C3EL interleaving
NEL & CCR.
1. During Iteration 1, C3EL performs:
• NEL: The initial NEL step maps the unam-
biguous mentions, Wolverine to the X-Men
movie character and Australia to the country,
with high confidence. However, link validation
fails for “Australia” as there is very low similar-
ity between the mention context features (e.g.,
Hugh, Wolverine, etc.) and the distant KB la-
bels extracted from its Wikipedia page (e.g.,
Commonwealth, population, etc.); thus the link
is dropped and the mention is added to NE. So
only the mention “Wolverine” is added to the
848
SE class and enriched with KB features (e.g.,
alias Logan).
On the other hand, the 3 “Hugh” mentions ex-
hibit low NEL confidence due to the high am-
biguity of this first name and are therefore clas-
sified into WE. The remaining mentions have
extremely low NEL confidence (due to sparse
contextual information) and are added to NE.
• CCR: The WE and NE classes are fed sep-
arately to the CCR procedure. Based on
the context summary similarities between men-
tions, C3EL performs hierarchical clustering
to group together the “Hugh” mentions (in
the WE class) and creates a co-referring men-
tion group with the individual mentions’ con-
text summaries concatenated. This merging
of summaries grows and strengthens captured
contexts, which propagates across documents.
This concludes the first iteration of C3EL.
2. The above results are provided to the second
Iteration:
• NEL: The context summary of the “Hugh”
mention group in WE now provides definitive
cues to correctly map it to the actor Hugh Jack-
man with high confidence, thus placing it in the
SE class.
• CCR: The ensuing CCR step groups together
“Ava Eliot” and “Ava” (in NE) using co-
occurrence context of the co-referring Hugh
mentions.
3. Subsequent NEL iterations (on WE and NE)
identify “Ava” as an out-of-KB entity and cor-
rectly links “Australia” to the movie using CCR-
generated mention-group contexts and link valida-
tion. CCR finally groups together “Logan” with
“Wolverine” based on context similarity with dis-
tant KB features. This process of alternating CCR
and NEL is repeated until all mention groups are
strongly connected to KB entities (placed in SE),
or no changes are made anymore.
The NEL and CCR procedures are performed
separately on the different mention types (like
PER, LOC, etc.), since different mention types
rarely co-refer. We next present the internal work-
ing details of the NEL and CCR stages of C3EL.
2.2.1 Named-Entity Linking (NEL) Stage
In its NEL procedure, C3EL disambiguates men-
tions to entities in the YAGO knowledge base
(yago-knowledge.org). We perform NEL on
the sentences (S(M
i
)) of a mention group, us-
ing named-entity popularity statistics and context,
to obtain the best matching entity, its confidence
score, and the corresponding Wikipedia page (from
sameAs link in YAGO). Assume a mention group
M
i
to be mapped to an entity e
i
with a confidence
score of ?(M
i
, e
i
).
A. Link Validation: For each mention group (e.g.,
Hugh), we extract distant KB labels such as se-
mantic types or categories (e.g., actor), title (e.g.,
Golden Globe winner), alias (e.g., Wolverine), lo-
cation, and gender (for person) from the Wikipedia
page infoboxes. The similarity of these features
to keywords obtained from the context summary
CS(M
i
) is computed using IR-style term frequen-
cies within a document (tf) and inverse document
frequencies within the corpus (idf). We utilize the
bag-of-words model based tf × idf -weighted co-
sine similarity measure. If the similarity score is
above a threshold, ? , the NEL result is accepted,
otherwise it is discarded – thus avoiding noisy link-
age of sparse mentions to prominent KB entries.
This subtle introduction of controlled distant su-
pervision within the C3EL framework enables ef-
ficient detection of out-of-KB mentions.
B. Classification: To sift out well-known and
long-tail entities from new ones, and prevent
“noisy” interactions among the contexts of in-
KB and out-of-KB mentions (with similar surface
forms), mention groups M
i
(linked to e
i
with score
?(M
i
, e
i
)) are classified into 3 classes by 2 thresh-
old parameters, ?
s
and ?
w
, as:
• Strong Evidence (SE): For ?(M
i
, e
i
) ? ?
s
,
mention group M
i
exhibits high linkage con-
fidence with e
i
and is placed in SE. If two
or more mentions in SE are independently
mapped to the same KB entity, they co-refer
transitively and are hence grouped together
with their context summaries merged (implicit
CCR). Distant KB features for mentions in SE
are extracted and appended to CS(M
i
), provid-
ing additional cues for later steps.
• Weak Evidence (WE): Mention groups with
?
w
? ?(M
i
, e
i
) < ?
s
are placed in this class.
They mostly represent long-tail in-KB entities
(sparsely represented in KB) with limited se-
mantic information (for detection) but might
also be new/emerging entities absent from KB.
• No Evidence (NE): ?(M
i
, e
i
) < ?
w
represents
mentions groups that have been mapped to null
(or have near-zero match confidence) or have
failed link validation during the NEL proce-
dure. These entities are most likely to be out-
of-KB and are allocated to this class.
2.2.2 Cross-Document CR (CCR) Stage
The CCR stage of C3EL adopts the sampling-
based hierarchical clustering approach of (Dutta
& Weikum, 2015), to obtain co-referring mention
clusters.
A. Similarity Measure: To infer whether two
mention groups represent the same entity, the simi-
larity between the context summaries are computed
based on (i) tf-idf -weighted bag-of-words cosine
distance, and (ii) partial-match scores of multi-
word keyphrases in bounded text windows (Taneva
et al., 2011). The context summaries (with stop-
words removed) are re-interpreted as, (i) bag of
words, and (ii) bag of keyphrases, to extract fea-
849
ture vectors for similarity computation. Finally,
the mixture model of bag-of-words (BoW) and
keyphrases (KP) of (Dutta & Weikum, 2015) is
used to assign feature weights using tf-idf measure.
B. Hierarchical Clustering: s mention groups
are uniformly randomly sampled and their sim-
ilarities to the other groups (using context sum-
mary) are computed. A similarity-weighted graph
with the mention groups as nodes and edge weights
representing mention-mention similarities is con-
structed. Bisection-based hierarchical balanced
min-edge-cut graph partitioning (Buluc et al.,
2013) is performed, using the METIS soft-
ware (Karypis & Kumar, 1999)
2
, to partition non-
coreferent mentions groups. The Bayesian Infor-
mation Criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978; Hour-
dakis et al., 2010), a Bayesian variant of Minimum
Description Length (Gr¨unwald, 2007), is used as
the cluster split stopping criterion, and the context
summaries within each final cluster are merged.
CCR aims to process heterogeneous corpora that
go beyond a single domain and style, such as Web
collections.
2.3 Finalization Stage
For the remaining mention groups in WE, we fi-
nally perform threshold based disambiguation of
mention clusters using the context summaries. For
each mention groupM
i
?WE, we compute (1) its
context summary similarities (as in Section 2.2.2)
to all other mention groups M
j
in SE by also using
distance features from the weakly linked KB enti-
ties, and (2) textual overlap between the mention
group representatives. M
i
is concatenated with the
best matching entity M
k
(in SE) if the similarity
score is above a threshold ?; else M
i
is marked as
an out-of-KB entity (mapped to null) and is placed
in theNE class. This helps in reducing propagated
CR errors like erroneous mention boundary detec-
tion (in NER), omissions in co-reference chain, etc.
(leading to “phantom” out-of-KB entities).
The obtained mention groups represent the final
equivalence classes of co-referring mentions across
documents – capturing both in-KB entities (with
links to the KB) in the SE class and out-of-KB
entities (mapped to null) in the NE class.
3 Experimental Evaluation
In this section, we empirically study the perfor-
mance of C3EL against various state-of-the-art
methods. We analyze the individual gains in CCR
and NEL due to the joint modeling.
Datasets: We use the following 2 publicly avail-
able corpora:
• EventCorefBank (ECB) corpus
3
(Bejan &
Harabagiu, 2010): contains 482 news and Web
articles (classified into 43 topics) with a total
2
glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
3
faulty.washington.edu/bejan/data/ECB1.0.tar.gz
of 5447 mentions corresponding to 1068 dis-
tinct named-entities. Entity co-reference an-
notations (across documents within each topic
cluster) were provided by (Lee et al., 2012),
and we performed manual examination of the
annotations for KB linking of the entities to
Wikipedia entries, if present; thus providing
ground truth for both CCR and NEL.
• ClueWeb2009 FACC1 dataset
4
(Gabrilovich
et al., 2013): provides machine automated
entity-linkage annotations of the ClueWeb09
corpus (ca. 1 Billion crawled Web pages) with
Freebase entries
5
. The corpus contains many
topical domains and highly diverse documents
from news, movie reviews, people home pages
to blogs and other social media posts. We ran-
domly select 500K documents containing 4.64
Million mentions associated with 1.29 Million
distinct entities to form our corpus. For NEL
ground-truth construction, we link the entities
to their Wikipedia pages (using Freebase’s “on
the web” property). Since no explicit anno-
tations of inter-document entity co-references
exists, we consider two mentions (in different
documents) to co-refer if they are linked with
the same Freebase entity.
Evaluation: To assess the output quality of C3EL
we use the following established metrics:
• B
3
F1 score (Bagga & Baldwin, 1998): mea-
sures the F1 score as the harmonic mean of av-
erage precision and recall computed over all
mention groups in the final equivalence classes.
Precision (for a mention group) represents the
ratio of the number of correctly reported co-
references (or linking) to the actual number;
while recall computes the fraction of the gold-
standard annotations correctly identified.
• ?
3
? CEAF score (Luo, 2005): provides
an alternate F1 score computed as in the B
3
measure; but calculates precision and recall of
mention groups using the best 1-to-1 mapping
(i.e., mapping with maximum mention overlap)
between the resultant equivalence classes and
those in the ground truth. Normalization with
the number of mentions for each of the resul-
tant classes yields the ?
4
-CEAF score.
We consider only the 3 most notable mention
types: person (PER), location (LOC), and orga-
nization (ORG) – accounting for 99.7% of enti-
ties present in the ECB corpus and 96.3% of our
ClueWeb09 corpus. All experiments were con-
ducted on a 4 core Intel i5 2.50 GHz processor with
8GB RAM running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Table 2: CCR performance (%) comparison on ECB
scribed in Section 2) during the NEL step ofC3EL
are based on 3 parameters: confidence thresholds
(?
s
and ?
w
) and validation threshold (? ); the values
of which can be tuned based on cross-validation
approach with train and test data subsets. Using
the “gold annotations” of the train-set (30% of to-
tal data), parameter values providing the best preci-
sion score are individually learnt using line search
with small step size.
In our experimental setup, we systematically
vary the parameter values and observe its effects
on C3EL for the training data. With increase in
?
s
, the number of mentions mapped to the Strong
Evidence (SE) class decreases. This in turn limits
the influx of external KB features, thus degrading
CCR performance as observed in Table 1(a). While
for low values of ?
s
, even weak mention links are
placed in SE, leading to a decrease in precision due
to noisy KB feature inclusion. On the other hand,
a high ?
w
value increases the number of mentions
in the NE class, while low values tends to accu-
mulate mentions in the WE class. This adversely
affects the detection of out-of-KB entities due to
noise from other co-occurring similar KB mentions
(refer Table 1(b)) during clustering in CCR step.
The effect of ? on C3EL has be shown in Ta-
ble 1(c). Similar to the behavior induced by ?
s
,
we observe that a high ? limits entity linking and
possible KB feature inclusion, while an extremely
low value (near to zero) allows for noisy feature
incorporation – both situations leading to lowered
CCR efficiency. However, since ? prevents gross
mis-alignment of mentions to KB entities, a wide
range of small value (0.1? 0.35) is seen to provide
comparable performance.
Hence, for our remaining experimental study we
set ?
s
= 0.11 and ?
w
= 0.06 (as in (Hoffart et al.,
2014)), while ? is set to 0.1, and threshold for the
finalization stage ? = 2× ?
s
= 0.22.
3.2 CCR Performance Results
We initially benchmark the performance improve-
ment in cross-document co-reference resolution
(CCR) procedure by C3EL against two compet-
ing approaches:
(1) state-of-the art sampling based hierarchical
clustering method, CROCS (Dutta & Weikum,
2015); and
(2) iterative joint entity-event CCR, EECR (Lee
et al., 2012).
Table 2 tabulates the results obtained on the ECB
dataset. We observe C3EL to decisively outper-
form both the existing methods, providing a B

F1 improvement of around 7% over CROCS and
17% over EECR. We further attain around 6%

A. Gold Results: Errors introduced during the pre-
processing stage of C3EL (e.g., mention omission,
tag mis-classification, intra-document CR errors,
etc., by the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit) propagate
to subsequent computing stages and adversely im-
pacts the overall system performance. To provide
an unbiased viewpoint of the actual performance
of C3EL, we manually provided “exact” men-
tions, mention tags, and intra-document CR men-
tion chains for the ECB corpus; thereby obtaining
gold performance results. From Table 3 we ob-
serve a 6% F1 points improvement (for both B
3
&
CEAF-?

) in C3EL compared to CROCS.
B. Mention Categorization: Person mention type
(PER) provides the greatest challenge for CCR sys-
tems (compared to other types like LOC, ORG,
etc.) due to associated nicknames, titles, and varied
surface forms (abbreviations, spellings, etc.). We
thus evaluate the CCR performance of C3EL (and
compare it with CROCS) on the ECB data, with
“exact” input mentions, for the different mention
categories. Table 4 validates that our joint mod-
eling provides better global information cues, re-
porting a B
3
F1 score enhancement of around 11%
over CROCS for PER mentions; along with im-
proved results for the other mention types as well.
C. Large Data: To study the robustness of C3EL
and the effects of large datasets on CCR, we
performed evaluations on the ClueWeb09-FACC1
dataset. Similar to the ECB dataset, C3EL ex-
hibits a B
3
F1 score improvement of nearly 10%
and a ?
3
-CEAF F1 improvement of 12% over
CROCS (refer Table 5).
The above experimental results showcase that
a combined approach helps overcome challenges
faced in CCR by entity linkage and corresponding
distant KB feature extraction; improving the over-
all accuracy.
3.3 Named-Entity Linking (NEL) Results
We now benchmark the performance of named-
entity linking (NEL) procedure for C3EL against
the state-of-the-art open-source AIDA software
(github.com/yago-naga/aida). We sepa-
rately inspect the precision of mention linking for
prominent entities (in-KB) as well as new/emerging
(out-of-KB) entities, and characterize the links as

Table 6: NEL performance (%) comparison on ECB
Correct (C), Incorrect (I), or Unlinked (U). The
results on the ECB corpus are reported in Table 6.
C3EL attains comparable performance (? 85%
precision) to that of AIDA for well-known entity-
mentions present in KB; albeit with a few mentions
remaining unlinked due to our cautious link val-
idation (using ? ) approach. However, the use of
? reduces aggressive KB linking to provide a sig-
nificant 15% improvement (over AIDA) in precise
detection of new/emerging entities absent in KB.
Overall, an 1.5% precision gain is observed by the
joint formulation.
A. Large Data: The diverse nature of the web-
scale ClueWeb09 dataset clearly portrays the per-
formance gains in NEL procedure due to CCR gen-
erated information integration. For entities present
in the KB, we observe an accuracy improvement of
0.5% over AIDA (refer Table 7). Similar to that of
the ECB data, C3EL attains a significant ? 14%
improvement in the detection of new/emerging en-
tities not represented in KB. For the 1 million men-
tions, C3EL provides around 4% overall perfor-
mance improvements.
Using a bootstrap re-sampling t-test (as in (Dur-
rett & Klein, 2014)), we observed high statistical
significance (p < 0.01) for Out-of-KB and Overall
NEL, whereas the difference for Within-KB NEL
is not statistically significant. Coping with Out-of-
KB entities is essential for joint CCR+NEL, and
an improved NEL performance using propagated
information from CCR using semantics along with
link validation enables highly efficient detection of
new or emerging entities.
3.4 Comparison with Joint Models
Traditional CR methods fail to cope with the het-
erogeneity of mentions and contexts across mul-
tiple documents, and some form of clustering or
joint reasoning over all mentions is thus mandatory.
These methods have quadratic or cubic (some-
times even exponential) complexity, and hence run-
ning CR+NEL on a concatenated super-document
works only for small corpora, and would be pro-
hibitively expensive for large corpora, even in of-
fline processing mode (Singh et al., 2011).
However, to study the behavior of existing CR-
NEL joint models under “small” CCR environ-

Table 7: NEL results (%) on ClueWeb09-FACC1 (statistical

ments, we compare C3EL with:
(1) multi-sieve based NECo (Hajishirzi et al.,
2013)
6
; and
(2) conditional random field based BER (Durrett
& Klein, 2014)
7
.
Three topic clusters from the ECB corpus with
3, 4, and 5 articles respectively were selected, and
the documents within each cluster were merged to
form 3 “super-articles” (one per topic), forming a
simulated CR setting. NECo and BER were then
used to perform CR and NEL on these 3 articles,
and the results compared with that obtained by
C3EL on the original documents. We repeatedly
sample 12 articles across 3 topic clusters, and ex-
ecute the approaches to report the micro-averaged
results across 5 independent runs.
From Table 8(a) we observe that the algorithms
exhibit comparable co-reference resolution perfor-
mance; thus validating propagation of global se-
mantics in C3EL due to the joint formulation.
However, such CR methods using multi-sieves and
CRF do not scale beyond few documents (upon
concatenation), and require at least 4× more run-
time compared to C3EL. Hence, CCR cannot be
efficiently tackled by simply employing CR meth-
ods on a “super-document”.
However, harnessing of non-local mention fea-
tures (via CCR) and efficient detection of new
mentions using link validation enables C3EL to
achieve a gain of around 5% in NEL compared to
others (see Table 8(b)). For both procedures, we
observed statistically significant improvements of
C3EL over BER and NECo with p < 0.05, using
the bootstrap re-sampling t-test.
To further study the effect of larger corpus, we
sampled 25 documents (with co-referring men-
tions) from the ClueWeb09 dataset and performed
analysis among the algorithms. As previously, we
observed significant computational complexity for
traditional CR methods when applied to CCR set-
ting making them far slower (6? 7×) than C3EL.
Table 9 reports the CCR and NEL averaged results
obtained across 5 independent runs. We attained
comparable performance in CCR with around 3%
improvement in NEL. All the algorithms are seen
to achieve high NEL results due to the large pres-
ence of well-known (in-KB) entities.

3.5 Algorithmic Baseline Study
We explore the performance of variants of C3EL
(on both corpora) ablating various system compo-
nents (see Table 10). Explicitly, we consider:
• Co-occurring Mentions: Removal of cooc-
currence mentions context from the context
summaries constructed, reduces semantic in-
formation and adversely affects both NEL and
CCR procedures. We thus observe a sharp de-
crease in CCR performance and also a degra-
dation in entity linking.
• Link Validation: Filtering of mention linking
to KB entities using link validation step (with
threshold ? ) in C3EL enables corroboration of
mention context keywords with the linked en-
tity features. This leads to enhanced detection
of new or emerging entities by reducing induc-
tion of noise during the CCR phase. Removal
of this process permits aggressive entity linking
and introduces noise, affecting new/emerging
entity detection. We observe (from Table 10)
nearly 20% reduction of precision (on both
datasets) in identification of out-of-KB entity-
mentions compared to C3EL.
• NEL Categorization: The differentiation of
mentions (into classes) confidently mapped to
KB entity reduces the collusion of “strong”
linked mentions with other “noisy” mention
contexts. This reduces incorrect grouping of
different mentions with similar surface forms,
contexts, etc., thereby improving precision of
the CCR process. Use of a single NEL classi-
fication approach is observed to degrade CCR
results, which in turn increases spurious entity
linkage, decreasing NEL efficiency (Table 10).
• Distant KB features: As observed in (Baker,
2012; Zheng et al., 2013), extracted external
KB features provide global and enhanced infor-
mation cues promoting CR. We similarly ob-
serve CCR to attain the lowest F1 scores (com-
pared to other baselines) when KB features
are ignored. This in turn affects the linking
of (some) well-known entities due to reduced
context, leading to incorrect or low confidence
NEL. Since no feature inclusion is performed
for out-of-KB mentions, no effect is observed.
We observe that a joint formulation encompass-
ing multiple information sources (along with noise
filtering) enables mutually enhanced CCR and
NEL within the proposed iterative feedback based
framework, C3EL.
4 Related Work
Co-reference Resolution (CR): Traditional intra-
document CR methods involve syntactic and se-
mantic feature combination for identifying the best
antecedent (preceding name or phrase) for a men-
tion. CR methods employ rules or supervised
learning techniques based on linguistic features
such as syntactic paths and mention distances to
assess semantic compatibility (Haghighi & Klein,
2009; Raghunathan et al., 2010; Rahman & Ng,
2011), while syntactic features are derived by deep
parsing of sentences and noun group parsing. Se-
mantic features from background knowledge re-
sources like encyclopedia were used in (Daum´e &
Marcu, 2005; Ponzetto & Strube, 2006; Ng, 2007).
The use of Wikipedia and structured knowledge
bases (such as YAGO) to obtain mention-type re-
lation and fine-grained mention attributes was ex-
plored by (Haghighi & Klein, 2009; Rahman &
Ng, 2011). An overview of CR methods is given
in (Ng, 2010).
Recent methods involve the use of multi-phase
sieve, applying a cascade of rules for narrow-
ing down the antecedent candidates for a men-
tion (Raghunathan et al., 2010). Cluster ranking
functions have also been proposed (Rahman & Ng,
2011; Zheng et al., 2013) to extend this paradigm
for incrementally expanding and merging mention
groups with preceding candidate clusters using re-
latedness features (Ratinov & Roth, 2012) and dis-
tant knowledge inclusion (Durrett & Klein, 2013).
Person name disambiguation, a specific variation
of CR, dealing with only person names, titles, nick-
names, and other surface form variations was intro-
duced in (Chen & Martin, 2007).
Distant Knowledge Labels: For obtaining seman-
tic features, additional knowledge resources such
as Wikipedia, YAGO, and FrameNet have been
considered (Rahman & Ng, 2011; Baker, 2012).
CR methods with confidence-thresholds were pro-
posed in (Ratinov & Roth, 2012; Lee et al., 2013),
and (Zheng et al., 2013) generalized these tech-

distance labels of the current mention and consid-
ers all matching mentions making the procedure
expensive. On the other hand, we extract distant
features for the strongly matching (best) candidate
only, reducing the performance overhead.
Cross-Document CR (CCR): Early approaches
towards CCR involved the use contextual infor-
mation from input documents for IR-style similar-
ity measures (e.g., tf×idf score, KL divergence,
etc.) over textual features (Bagga & Baldwin,
1998; Gooi & Allan, 2004). Probabilistic graph-
ical models jointly learning the mappings of men-
tions to equivalent classes (co-referring mentions)
using features similar to local CR techniques were
studied in (Culotta et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2010;
Singh et al., 2011), A clustering approach coupled
with statistical learning of parameters was stud-
ied in (Baron & Freedman, 2008). However, such
methods fail to cope with large corpora, and hence
a “light-weight” streaming variant of CCR was in-
troduced by (Rao et al., 2010).
Co-occurring mentions context have been har-
nessed for disambiguating person names for CR
in (Mann & Yarowsky, 2003; Niu et al., 2004; Chen
& Martin, 2007; Baron & Freedman, 2008). How-
ever, these methods do not use KB and depend
on information extraction (IE) methods, witness-
ing substantial noise due to IE quality variance. A
CCR framework combining co-occurring mention
context with distant KB features embedded in an
active hierarchical clustering procedure (Dutta &
Weikum, 2015) was recently shown to perform ef-
ficiently, and provides inspiration for parts of our
proposed C3EL approach.
Named Entity Linking (NEL): Named entity res-
olution and linking stems from SemTag (Dill et
al., 2003), and similar frameworks like GLOW,
WikipediaMiner, AIDA, and others (Milne & Wit-
ten, 2008; Ratinov et al., 2011). A collection
of entity disambiguation models was presented
in (Kulkarni et al., 2009). Other NEL approaches
utilize the notion of semantic similarity of enti-
ties to corresponding Wikipedia pages (Milne &
Witten, 2008), while co-referent mention graph
construction modeling mention co-occurrences and
context similarity from outgoing hyperlinks in
Wikipedia was used by (Hoffart et al., 2011). An
integer linear programming (ILP) formulation also
based on Wikipedia page similarities was presented
in (Ratinov et al., 2011). However, none of these
methods involve the incorporation of CR results
for NEL. The first study on the benefits of CR for
NEL was by (Ratinov & Roth, 2012); but a joint
model was not proposed, instead attributes from
Wikipedia categories were used as features. An
overview and evaluation of different NEL methods
has been given by (Hachey et al., 2013).
Joint Models: Jointly solving CR for entities and
events utilizing cluster construction based on fea-
ture semantic dependencies was devised in (Lee et
al., 2012). The use of CR as a pre-processing step
for subsequent NEL procedure using an ILP for-
mulation was proposed by (Chen & Roth, 2013).
Recently, (Hajishirzi et al., 2013) proposed a joint
model for CR and NEL using the Stanford multi-
pass cluster update CR system with automatic link-
ing of mentions to Wikipedia. An integrated belief
propagation-based framework for CR, NER, and
relation extraction was developed in (Singh et al.,
2013). Subsequently, the model was enhanced by
the use of structured conditional random fields, to
solve CR, NER, and NEL in combination (Durrett
& Klein, 2014). Other works involving joint for-
mulation of NER and NEL use uncertainty of men-
tion boundaries along with segmentation informa-
tion extracted from Wikipedia (Sil & Yates, 2013).
However, to the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first approach to jointly tackle CCR
and NEL across documents in an entire corpus.
5 Conclusions
This paper presented the novel C3EL frame-
work for joint computation of cross-document co-
reference resolution (CCR) and named-entity link-
ing (NEL). Our approach utilizes: (1) context sum-
maries including co-occurring mention groups al-
lowing for global context and feature propagation,
and (2) link validation for NEL using distant KB
features. This is embedded in an interleaved CCR
and NEL model allowing for global semantics and
feature propagation. The iterative approach en-
ables information feedback between CCR (pro-
vides corpus-wide cues) and NEL (providing dis-
tant KB features). Experimental results on news
and web data demonstrate improved performance
of both CCR and NEL compared to prior methods.
