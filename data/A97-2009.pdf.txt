Logos Machine Translation System 
Logos Corporation has been involved in machine translation R&D for over 27 years. 
From an English-Vietnamese system produced in 1972 to the latest releases of our 
software we have striven to produce the best machine translation (MT) software 
available. Today the Logos system is one of the best commercial MT systems on the 
market. 
Our architecture coupled with experience in the commercial sector has made us a 
leader in providing solutions in our users' translation work. Logos does not claim to 
replace human translators; rather, we seek to enhance the professional translator's 
work environment. 
The Logos system is fundamentally different from other computer-based translation 
programs. In addition to the easily extensible dictionaries with their underlying semantic 
foundation, Logos offers mechanisms that permit meanings to be deduced using 
contextual clues. These permit problem cases, such as concepts with completely 
separate meanings or subtle variations, to be translated suitably. 
Logos analyzes whole source sentences, considering morphology, meaning, and 
grammatical structure and function. The analysis determines the semantic relationships 
between words as well as the syntactic structure of the sentence. Parsing is only source 
language-specific; generation is target language-specific. Although the Logos system 
was originally developed on the basis of a transfer approach, this has evolved in time to 
the present in which clear intedingual features are inherent in the system. 
Unlike other commercial systems the Logos system relies heavily on semantic analysis. 
Using our proprietary Semantico-Syntactic Abstraction Language (SAL) the parser is 
able to achieve better results than syntactic analysis alone would allow. 
This comprehensive analysis permits the Logos system to construct a complete and 
idiomatically correct translation in the target language. All aspects of the sentence 
contribute to the result. 
The Logos system is an outstanding example of applying computational linguistics in 
the commercial sector. 
Our exhibit at the 5 th Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing will offer live 
demonstrations of the Logos Translation Express TM system. This Intemet-based 
system allows users to submitted formatted ocuments for translation to our server and 
retrieve translated documents without loss of formatting.
