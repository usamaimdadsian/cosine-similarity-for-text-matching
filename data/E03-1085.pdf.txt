Abstract
This paper presents PEAS, the first
comparative evaluation framework for
parsers of French whose annotation
formalism allows the annotation of both
constituents and functional relations. A
test corpus containing an assortment of
different text types has been built and
part of it has been manually annotated.
Precision/Recall and crossing brackets
metrics will be adapted to our formalism
and applied to the parses produced by
one parser from academia and another
one from industry in order to validate the
framework.
1 Introduction
In natural language understanding, many
complex applications use a syntactic parser as a
basic functionality. Today, in particular for the
French language, the developers face the great
diversity of the offer in the domain. Therefore,
the need for a complete comparative evaluation
framework — including a pivot annotation
formalism, a reference treebank, evaluation
metrics and the associated software — is
increasing.
It is worth noting that most of the recently
developed parsers use a robust approach.
Consequently, they do not always produce a
complete parse of the sentence, but they are able
to produce a result, whatever the size, the
particularities and the grammaticality of the
input. For this reason, it is essential to be able to
compare in a fair way the parses they produce
against those produced by other parsers whatever
their characteristics. One possible solution is to
offer a common reference annotation formalism
along with a fully parsed reference corpus and a
set of robust metrics, allowing for both complete
and selective evaluation over an assortment of
different text types and syntactic phenomena.
The aim of our research is to build such
evaluation framework, which to date is missing
for French. Figure 1 presents the different
modules of our evaluation protocol as it stands
today.

2 Annotation formalism
The definition of the annotation formalism is the
core element of the evaluation process. Indeed,
the formalism must have a coverage of
syntactical phenomena as broad as possible in
order to allow any parser to participate, whatever
the grammatical formalism it uses.
We have decided immediately upon a two-
steps annotation: first the chunks annotation is
carried out, second functional information is
annotated through relations between words,
words and chunks or between chunks. The
constituents or chunks are continuous and non-
embedded. They are as small as possible to allow
any segmentation chosen by a parser to be
converted into our formalism. For the same
reason, the information that is not expressed in
the constituents is expressed through a large
number of functional relations: twelve in all.
Such formalism is closer to a dependency-based
formalism than to a constituent based formalism
(Sleator and Temperley, 1991). It neither
prevents the "deep" parsers to be evaluated, nor
disadvantages them, but the transcription of their
parses could be more complex. The six types of
chunks and twelve functional relations are given
in table 1. They were mainly inspired by Abeille
et al. (2000), and have been adapted while
annotating corpus excerpts.

Table 1: Annotated chunks and relations
No clausal or sentential segmentation is
identified, because as in a dependency-based
formalism, the complex structure of the sentence
is obtained through the whole chain of relations.
The following sentence l that contains three noun
phrases (NP) gives an example: <NP1> la porte
de la chambre fermee a clef a l'interieur
</NP1><NP2> les volets de l'unique fenetre
fermes, eux aussi, a l'interieur </NP2> et
<NP3> par-dessus les volets, les barreaux
intacts </NP3>, [...J. In our formalism, the noun
phrases are described through the following
chunks and relations:
<GN1> la porte </GN1>
<GN2> les volets </GN2>
<GN3> les barreawc </GN3>
coordination ("," , GN1, GN2)
coordination (et, GN2, GN3)
And the noun phrase NP1 is expressed through:
<GN1> la porte </GM>
<GP1> de la chambre </GP1>
<GAl> fermee </GAl>
<GP2> a clef </GP2>
<GP3> a Vinterieur </GP3>
modifier-noun (GP1, porte)
modifier-noun (GA1, porte)
modifier-adjective (GP2, fermee)
Moreover, since our chunks are not embedded,
all the modifiers placed before a noun are
included in the same nominal group as the noun
itself. And here again, the relations are used to
express the links between the particular terms, as
in the annotated example of mon tres riche et
tres proche ami2 :
<GN> mon tres riche et tres proche ami </GN>
modifier-adjective (tres, riche)
modifier-adjective (tres, proche)
coordination (et, riche, proche)
modifier-noun (et, ami)
The formalism gives the possibility to
annotate ambiguities at dependency level (by
duplicating the relation tables). Note that we are

still studying how our evaluation will handle this
phenomenon.
3 Corpus and tools for annotation
The corpus retained for annotation is a set of
texts whose nature is as diverse as possible.
Indeed the corpus contains excerpts from:
newspapers, novels, Web pages, automatic audio
transcriptions, and a set of questions translated
from the question-answering track of TREC. The
whole corpus contains 1 million words; each text
has been segmented in sentences and tokenized
in words. Each participant to the evaluation
protocol has received the texts both in pre-
segmented and original format.
The part of the corpus that has been annotated
contains about 20,000 words. The annotation
tools, that we have developed, use an HTML
editor. For chunk marking, the annotator selects
chunks and colors them (each type of chunk
corresponding to a particular color). For the
twelve functional relations, the annotator has a
set of twelve tables to fill in for each sentence;
giving for each relation the address of its
parameters. Of course, all of them are not to be
filled in. All the information thus annotated is
then translated into an XML format. Annotation
of the example of §2 is translated in:

For the French language, Abeille et al. (2000)
is the only other attempt at building a treebank.
In this case, the corpus is homogeneous in text
genre, since it contains only newspaper articles
extracted from Le Monde although it covers
various domains from politics to sports. The
approach is however ambitious and interesting:
the corpus contains 1M words, 17 000 different
lemma; it is annotated both with morpho-syntax
and grammatical functions.
4 Evaluation metrics
The first proposals for parser evaluation were
made in Parseval (Black et al., 1991). Carroll et
al. (1998) gave a survey and proposed a new
evaluation scheme. Since, two orientations have
emerged. The first, inspired by Parseval, is based
on phrase boundaries and uses recall plus
crossing-bracket measures. Although it has been
criticized (Gaizauskas 1998, Lin 1998), it is still
in use nowadays. The second one is based on
dependency relations, (on which recall and
precision can also be computed) and seems to be
more and more in favor (see the workshop
Beyond Parseval 2002).
Since our annotation formalism has both
constituents and functional relations, there is no
reason to dismiss either approaches.
Nevertheless, we have to outline that the
transcription of the parses will be more
systematic for the relations than for the
97
constituents. Indeed, in our formalism, relations
can associate words, chunks or words and
chunks, but it is always possible to match any
relation argument with the reference parse,
because we always know to which chunk a word
belongs. On the other hand, for the segmentation,
the chunk boundaries may vary a lot from one
parse to another. So we have to foresee either an
important set of matching rules, or flexible
evaluation methods.
5 Prospective
Based on this preliminary research, a larger
project for syntactic parser evaluation, named
EASY/EVALDA has been accepted by
TECHNOLANGUE, a joint program of the three
French Ministries of Industry, Culture and
Research. A rather large francophone community
has declared its interest for the project, fourteen
participants (belonging to universities or to
private institutions) are ready to evaluate their
parser, while five corpus providers are interested
in annotating large size corpora both in syntax
and in functional relations. This community will
contribute to enrich every aspect of our proposal:
annotation formalism, tools and metrics.
Moreover, the participation of a sufficient
number of parsers will allow the production of a
good quality validated linguistic resource.
Indeed, we will produce the automatic fusion of
all annotated data of the parsers, and then
manually correct the divergent parses.'
Last of all, the XML format into which we
translate the parses is an open exchange format.
It is an important asset for portability and reuse
of parsing technolgy. E.g. for question answering
application, where a parser is often needed to
parse both the questions and the huge set of
candidate answers, the use of XML makes easier
the selection of the paser for the task at hand.
6 Conclusion
At the time of writing, we have developed all
the different phases of our evaluation process
except for the evaluation metrics tools. The two
candidate parsers have parsed the corpus, and we
are now translating their outputs within our

formalism. Here, the difficulty is neither to loose
information nor to miss incorrect parses. The
application of our metrics and the results
examination will constitute a first validation of
our framework.
