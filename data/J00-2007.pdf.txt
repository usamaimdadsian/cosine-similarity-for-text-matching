This monograph belongs to a literary species that flowers every time Chomsky comes 
up with a new proposal and has as its aim to show that what is proposed is woefully 
inadequate on empirical and theoretical grounds. This kind of literature has a ped- 
agogical role to play in theoretical linguistics and card-carrying syntacticians should 
read the book. However, over the years Chomsky's versions of syntactic theory have 
become so irrelevant o natural anguage processing that computational linguists can 
safely skip this book and the one it is a response to, Chomsky (1995). 
But, as it is not a long book, some computational linguists might be interested 
in reading the first chapters as a quick summary of early minimalism and the fourth 
chapter as an introduction to the HPSG treatment of wh-constructions. After a brief intro- 
ductory chapter, the authors ummarize the Chomsky 1995 version of global economy 
in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, they discuss two versions of local economy, that proposed 
by Collins (1997) and the one developed by Yang (1997). They contrast he Minimalist 
Program model with what they call the incremental interface correspondence model, 
which is exemplified in several recent linguistic frameworks, from Montague grammar 
to LFG, to GPSG, to TAGS, to cite only a few. In Chapter 4, they compare an account 
of wh-constructions in Iranian Arabic according to a local version of economy to one 
based on an HPSG local-constraint approach. The last chapter addresses i sues of theory 
construction i  general. 
The general argument developed in the second chapter is somewhat awkward: the 
authors want to show that the three main economy principles proposed by Chomsky 
(Procrastinate, the Smallest Derivation Principle, and "Have an Effect on Output") are 
unnecessary. They do this mainly by showing that other, more GB-like, mechanisms 
could account for the same data. Given the limited amount of data discussed (a lot 
of the discussion centers on the contrast between There seems to be somebody in the 
room and *There seems omebody tobe in the room), it would be rather astonishing if this 
were not the case. We get here the familiar dialogue des sourds where one party points 
out descriptive problems and alternatives whereas the other party is arguing about 
"explanatory" adequacy. The discussion allows the authors to make a couple of points 
about the computational complexity of the Minimalist Program proposal that would 
certainly help scare away practically minded computer linguists, but as I said above, 
I do not think they will be tempted. It makes also the usual points about Chomsky's 
sloppiness and vagueness.

The third chapter looks at attempts to replace global economy by local economy, 
a move that could help alleviate the computational problem. Johnson and Lappin 
show that the proposal made by Collins does away, by and large, with the economy 
approach as such and actually proposes local constraints, and that the proposal by 
Yang is empirically and formally inadequate in that it proposes a metric that leads to 
contradictory ankings. The authors then propose their own explicit account of raising 
and expletive constructions in an incremental correspondence model. In general, I
sympathize with the authors' complaints about the lack of rigor and explicitness of 
syntactic work by the current followers of Chomsky. But I have to admit that to 
compare a fully developed mature theory, such as HPSG, to something that cannot 
be more than a sketch, such as minimalism, on the grounds of descriptive adequacy 
strikes me as a bit facile. The discussion, however, brings out some valuable points 
about the oddities of minimalist heory construction with respect o interpretable and 
noninterpretable f atures, a distinction that in a derivational approach needs to be 
made before the information to make it is available. 
The fourth chapter discusses ome wh-constructions in Iranian Arabic, a language 
that has wh-words both in sentence initial position and in situ. The HPSG account given 
seems adequate; minimalism as it stands seems to get into contradictions in the face 
of this set of facts. The authors do a good job in summarizing the main points of the 
HPSG approach for those of us that might have some trouble keeping all the various 
features and their behavior straight. 
In the last chapter, Johnson and Lappin address more-general issues. They point 
out that while Chomsky always stresses Universal Grammar as determined by biolog- 
ical properties of the brain, optimality of design as proposed in minimalism is rarely 
a characteristic of biological systems. This is a short chapter and it is rather anecdo- 
tal, but it raises important questions. The meager esults of forty years of syntactic 
theory constructions by bright and enthusiastic practitioners lead one to suspect hat 
there is something fundamentally wrong with the way the problem is being looked 
at: to assume that simplicity and parsimony are part of universal grammar might 
just be misguided. A degree of redundancy and independence of subparts might be 
the necessary characteristics of a robust and continuously evolving system such as 
language, and theories uch as minimalism might be more harmful because they are 
philosophically misguided than because they are descriptively inadequate.
