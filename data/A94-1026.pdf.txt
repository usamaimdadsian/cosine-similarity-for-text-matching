Abstract 
Japanese texts frequently suffer from the 
homophone errors caused by the KANA-KANJI 
conversion eeded to input the text. It is critical, 
therefore, for Japanese revision support systems 
to detect and to correct homophone errors. This 
paper proposes a method for detecting and 
correcting Japanese homophone errors in 
compound nouns. This method can not only detect 
Japanese homophone errors in compound nouns, 
but also can find the correct candidates for the 
detected errors automatically. Finding the correct 
candidates i one superiority of this method over 
existing methods. The basic idea of this method 
is that a compound noun component places ome 
restrictions on the semantic ategories of the 
adjoining words. The method accurately 
determines that a homophone is misused in a 
compound noun if one or both of its neighbors i  
not a member of the semantic set defined by the 
homophone. Also, the method successfully 
indicates the correct candidates for the detected 
homophone errors. 
1 Introduction 
We have been using morphological nalysis to develop 
REVISE, a revision support system that corrects Japanese 
input errors (Ikehara, Yasuda, Shimazaki, and Takagi, 
1987; Ohara, Takagi, Hayashi, and Takeishi, 1991). 
REVISE can detect and correct various types of errors, 
such as character deletion, character insertion and some 
grammatical errors, using knowledge bases that describe 
the characteristics of each error type (see figure 1). 
Homophone errors are one of the error types that can be 
detected and corrected in REVISE. 
Most Japanese texts are made with Japanese word 
processors. As Japanese texts consist of phonograms, 
KANA, and ideograms, KANJI, lapanese word processors 
always use KANA-KANJI conversion in which KANA 
sequences (i.e. readings) input through the key board are 
converted into KANA-KANJI sequences. Therefore, 
Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused by 
erroneous KANA-KANJI conversion. A homophone error 
occurs when a KANA sequence is converted into the 
wrong word which has the same KANA sequence (i.e. 
the same reading). Therefore, detecting and correcting 
homophone errors is an important topic.

Previous research into detecting homophone rrors 
with revision supportsystems used two approaches; 
(a) using correct-wrong word pairs (Kuga, 1986), 
Co) using KWIC (Key Word In Context) lists (Fukushima, 
Ohtake, Ohyama, and Shutoh, 1986; Suzuki and 
Takeda, 1989). 
Previous research into correct homophone selection in 
KANA-KANJI conversion used the following two 
methods; 
(c) using collocation of words (Nakano, 1982; Tanaka, 
Mizutani, and Yoshida, 1984; Makino and Kizawa, 
1981). 
(d) using case frame grammar (Oshima, Abe, Yuura, and 
Takeichi, 1986). 
Method (a) has a drawback in that only pre-defined wrong 
words in correct-wrong word pairs are detected. Method 
(b) only indicates which words are in the KWIC list. 
Therefore, method (b) cannot automatically detect if the 
word is misused. Method (c) demands the creation of a 
huge dictionary which must describe all possible word 
collocations. Method (d) can select he correct homophone 
by using the semantic restriction between a verb and its 
cases based on case frame grammar. It is difficult, 
however, to use method (d) for detecting the homophone 
156 
errors in compound nouns because it mainly depends on 
JOSHI (i.e. Japanese postpositions) which are absent in 
compound nouns. Furthermore, it is difficult, if not 
impossible, for existing methods, (a)~(d), to correct 
homophone errors. 
This paper describes a method for detecting and 
correcting homophone errors in compound nouns used 
in REVISE. The idea underlying this method is that a 
compound noun component semantically restricts the 
semantic ategories of adjoining words. Using semantic 
categories reduces dictionary size; moreover, this method 
needs no syntactic information such as case frames. Mso 
described are the experimental results made to certify 
the validity of this method. 
2 Definition of key terms 
Key terms used in this paper are defined as follows: 
• Japanese compound noun; 
A noun that consists of several nouns, none of which 
have JOSHI (i.e. Japanese postpositions). 
• Homophone; 
A word that sounds the same as another but has different 
spelling (i.e. KANJI sequence) and meaning. 
• Homophone error; 
An error that occurs when a KANA sequence is 
converted into the wrong word which has the same 
KANA sequence (i.e. the same reading) as the correct 
one. 
• Semantic ategory; 
A class for dividing nouns themselves into concepts 
according to their meaning. For example, both "~t .~.'." 
and "~/'~,." belong to the same semantic ategory 
\[nature\]. 
3 A variety of homophone rrors 
It is necessary to use semantic information, such as the 
semantic restriction between words in a sentence, tohandle 
homophone errors. We note that it is difficult, if may not 
impossible, to handle all homophone errors uniformly. 
For example, within a compound noun, the semantic 
restriction is mainly seen between adjacent words. The 
case frame semantic restriction encompasses the whole 
sentence. Therefore, the discussion of this paper focuses 
on the detection and correction of homophone errors in 
compound nouns. 
4 A method for handling homophone 
errors 
Tanaka and Yoshida (1987) pointed out that the 
collocation of words in compound nouns is restricted 
semantically. This means that the existence of compound 
noun component "X" semantically restricts the set of 
words that can appear next to "X". In order to describe 
this set, we use semantic ategories instead of the words 
themselves to significantly reduce dictionary size. 
Namely, if a word is to be accepted as an immediate 
neighbor of "X", its semantic ategory must be within 
the set defined by "X".

Figure 2: Flow diagram of handling homophone errors. 
Figure 2 shows the flow diagram of handling homophone 
errors. Handling consists of two processes: error detection 
and error correction. In the error correction process, the 
correct candidates for detected homophone errors can be 
indicated to the user automatically. The user is responsible 
for the final selection of the correct homophone from 
among the indicated candidates. Semantic restrictions, 
which are used in both processes, are described in a 
semantic restriction dictionary using semantic ategories. 
4.1 Detecting homophone rrors in compound 
nouns 
The compound noun that includes only one homophone, 
h i, is represented as; 
wp hiw°, 
where up, Wo are words that have no homophones. The 
set of words with the same reading as h i is 
H= { hl, h 2, "", hl, "", hm }. 
PS i is the set of semantic ategories that can appear 
immediately before homophone h i. NS i is the set of 
semantic ategories that can appear immediately after h i. 
Here, we assume that each semantic restriction for 
each word in set H is exclusive. That is, for every i, j, 
esi n P% = 
NS i {q NSj = #, --- (1) 
iq=j, i,j = 1 ,2 , ' " ,m.  
In the compound noun wp h i w n, when h i is the correct 
homophone, the semantic ategories of wp and w, satisfy 
the semantic restrictions of h,, i.e., 
157 
the semantic category ofwp e PS~ and 
the semantic category of w, e NS ~ ".  (2) 
On the other hand, when h i is the wrong homophone, 
semantic ategories of wp and w, do not satisfy the 
semantic restriction for h i, i.e., from (1) and (2); 
the semantic category ofwp 4E PS i and/or 
the semantic category of w. ~ NS ~ -'- (3) 
Therefore, we can detect homophone errors in compound 
nouns based on (2) and (3). 
4.2 Insufficient semantic discrimination 
It is possible that set H contains two or more words 
whose PSs and/or NSs overlap, such that the semantic 
sets do not yield sufficient discrimination performance. 
Namely, several semantic restrictions for words in set H 
do not satisfy formula (1), i.e., for the semantic categories 
of several words in set H, 
PSi fq PSi 4: 4,  
NS i CI NS i 4: 4, "'" (4) 
i 
In this case, semantic ategories which do not belong to 
PS i CI PS i or NS t CI NS i can also be used for detecting 
homophone errors based on (2) and/or (3). The words 
with semantic ategories belonging to PS i N PS i or NS~ 
CI NSi, however, fail to distinguish i and h because 
such categories satisfy both semantic restrictions in terms 
of h i and h i . 
It is very difficult to construct a semantic ategory 
system that would satisfy formula (1) for all words. 
Therefore, in REVISE, when a word whose semantic 
categories belong to PS i N PS i or NS i N NS i adjoin h~ 
or h i in compound nouns, h i or h i is detected as a 
homophone rror. This may wrongly indicate correct 
homophones a  errors but no error will be missed. This 
is a basic requirement ofany text revision support system 
and/or any text proofreading system. 
4.3 Correct ing homophone errors in 
compound nouns 
The correct homophone in a compound noun should satisfy 
the semantic restrictions established by its adjoining 
words. The semantic ategory for the adjoining word of 
the homophone error should be included in the sets of 
semantic categories that can appear immediately 
before/after the correct homophone. Namely, it is the 
correct candidates for the detected homophone error that 
satisfy formula (2) and that have the same KANA 
sequence (i.e. the same reading) as the error. When the 
semantic ategory sets of homophones partially overlap 
and the category of the adjoining word falls into the 
overlap region, the homophone is detected as erroneous 
even if it is correct, as described above in 4.2. In this 
case, the detected homophone itself is 'also indicated as 
one of the correct candidates if it satisfies formula (2). 
To indicate only candidates which satisfy formula (2) 
leads us to a shortened correction process because the 
correct homophone will be included in the candidates. 
4.4 Semantic restriction dictionary 
The semantic restriction dictionary describes which 
semantic ategories can adjoin, either before or after, 
each homophone. Figure 3 shows the format of the 
semantic restriction dictionary. A record consists of the 
following four items; 
• homophone r ading: the semantic restriction dictionary 
is retrieved by the homophone reading in the error 
correction process, to find the correct candidates for 
the detected homophone error. 
• KANJI homophone spelling: the dictionary is retrieved 
by the KANJI homophone spelling in the error detection 
process, to determine whether the homophone is 
misused in the compound noun or not. 
• information whether semantic restrictions in this record 
apply to the preceding or following word. 
• semantic restrictions: this is the set of semantic 
categories that can adjoin the homophone. Semantic 
categories which are included in two or more sets of 
the homophones are marked as to show insufficient 
semantic discrimination. 
Ways of using the semantic restriction dictionary in 
both processes, error detection and error correction, will 
be described using examples in the next section.

4.5 Examples  of  handling homophone r ro rs  
An example of detecting homophone rrors in the 
compound noun "~1.~ ' ,~" ,  which includes the 
homophone "~-~-(chemistry)" is shown in figure 4. "~ 
~" ,  whose reading is "¢~'~< (kagaku)", has the 
homophonic word "~-~-(science)" while "I~ .~,'," has no 
homophonic word. The word preceding homophone "~ 
~--" in the compound noun "\[~ ,~,',~-~--" is "l~t ,~,'," and it 
has the semantic ategory \[nature\]. As shown in figure 
4, semantic ategory \[nature\] is not included in the set 
that represents the semantic restriction on the possible 
prior neighbors of "'\[~-~-". Therefore, "~j~:" is detected 
as a homophone error in the compound noun "~ ~\ [~ 
-~" based on formula (3). Next, the error correction 
process is invoked after detecting homophone error 'q~

"~"  has homophonic words "~,r/~(machine) '' and 
"~/~(chance)", while "-E4~" has no homophonic word. 
Although, as shown in figure 5, semantic category \[act\] 
is included in the semantic ategory set for the words 
preceding "~to~", this category is also included in the 
other semantic category set (in figure 5, this fact is shown 
by outlining). As mentioned in section 4.2, such a case 
is flagged as a homophone error even though it is correct 
neighbors of homophonic word "~ff~-" is then obtained. 
Because the semantic ategory \[nature\] for "t~l~" is 
included in this set, "~"  is indicated as a correct 
candidate for homophone error "'f~-~--" in the compound 
noun "I~I ,~.'.4~-~" based on formula (2). 
Let's consider an example that exhibits insufficient 
semantic discrimination. The compound noun " -V~

(actually "/~-l~" is correct in this example). Therefore, 
"~"  in the compound noun "SE~d~ " is detected as 
the error, and the correction process is invoked. The 
semantic restriction dictionary is accessed using the 
reading "~ ~),p~". The semantic set of possible prior 
neighbors of homophonic words "~-~" and "~"  are 
then obtained. The semantic ategory \[act\] is an element 
of the set for "~-~-~" but is not included the set for "~ 
~" .  According to formulae (2) and (3), only "g\]\[~" and 
"-~-~" are indicated as correct candidates. Although the 
correct homophone is detected as the error, that he correct 
homophone (the original homophone) will be a candidate 
shortens the correction process. 
5 Experiments 
The validity of this method was confirmed with 
experiments in detecting and correcting homophone 
errors. We assumed that he input compound nouns were 
already segmented into component words and that heir 
reading and semantic categories were already added.

5.2 Description of semantic restr ict ion 
• The semantic ategory system: 
The semantic ategory system used in the experiments 
was constructed by referring to BUNRUI-GOI-HYO 
edited by the National Language Research Institute 
(1964) and RUIGO-SHIN-JITEN written by Ono and 
Hamanishi (1981), which are the most famous emantic 
category systems for the Japanese language. The 
semantic system has about 200 nodes and covers about 
35,000 words. 
• The semantic restriction dictionary: 
Compound nouns including all homophones in table 1, 
were collected from newspaper a ticles over a 90 day 
period, and the semantic restriction dictionary was made 
based on the semantic restrictions between the 
homophones and the adjoining words in compound 
nouns. 
5.3 Exper imenta l  results 
Generally speaking, the performance ofan error detection 
method can be measured by two indices: the detection 
rate indicates the percentage oferrors correctly determined 
and the misdetection rate indicates the percentage of
correct words that are erroneously detected as errors. 
The detection rate is defined as; 
Detection rate = the number of errors detected actual number of 
wrong compounds in the sample. 
160 
The misdetection rate is defined as; 
Misdetection rate= 
the number of 
homophones misdetected 
actual number of 
correct compounds in the sample. 
The experimental results are shown in table 3. The 
detection rate is over 95%. This value is much higher 
than the 48.9% rate previously reported (Suzuki and 
Takeda, 1989). On the other hand, the misdetection rate 
is less than 30%. This value shows that the proposed 
method determined that over 70% of the correct 
homophones in compound nouns were correct. This means 
that the confirmation process can be significantly 
shortened because fewer correct compounds are presented 
for confirmation. Moreover, in the correction process, 
for more than 80% of detected errors, the correct 
homophone was a candidate. These results show that 
this method can detect and correct homophone errors in 
compound nouns successfully.

5.4 Discussion 
We analyzed the experimental results and determined 
that misdetection is caused by two factors; 
(a) imperfect semantic restriction dictionary, 
Co) semantic ategories that belong to sets that can adjoin 
words having the same reading. 
The number of compound nouns used to make the semantic 
restriction dictionary was different for each word reading. 
When the number of compound nouns used to construct 
the dictionary is large enough, misdetection caused by 
factor (a) will be minimized. Factor (b) can be offset by 
optimizing the semantic ategory system to improve 
semantic discrimination. This problem will be researched 
in the future. 
6 Conclusion 
This paper has described a method for detecting and 
correcting Japanese homophone rrors in compound 
nouns used in a revision support system for Japanese 
texts; REVISE. The underlying concept of this method 
is that a compound noun component can restrict he set 
of semantic ategories of words that can adjoin the 
component. The method accurately determines that a 
homophone is misused in a compound noun if one or 
both of its neighbors is not a member of the set defined 
by the homophone. Also, the method successfully 
indicates the correct candidates for the detected 
homophone errors automatically. Experiments indicate 
that he detection rate is over 95% and that the misdetection 
rate is less than 30%. These results conf'mn the validity 
of this method in detecting and correcting Japanese 
homophone errors in compound nouns.
