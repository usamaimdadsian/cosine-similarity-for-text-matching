Abstract
This paper aims to find errors that lead to
dialogue breakdowns in chat-oriented dia-
logue systems. We collected chat dialogue
data, annotated them with dialogue break-
down labels, and collected comments de-
scribing the error that led to the break-
down. By mining the comments, we first
identified error types. Then, we calculated
the correlation between an error type and
the degree of dialogue breakdown it in-
curred, quantifying its impact on dialogue
breakdown. This is the first study to quan-
titatively analyze error types and their ef-
fect in chat-oriented dialogue systems.
1 Introduction
Chat-oriented or open-domain dialogue systems
have recently been attracting attention from so-
cial and entertainment aspects (Bickmore and Cas-
sell, 2001; Banchs and Li, 2012; Wilcock and
Jokinen, 2013). However, since they need to
deal with open-domain utterances, which current
natural language processing techniques are not
mature enough to handle appropriately, the sys-
tem inevitably makes errors. This discourages
users from talking to the system, leading to di-
alogue breakdowns in conversation (Martinovsky
and Traum, 2003). Here, dialogue breakdowns de-
note points in dialogue where users are unable to
continue the conversation.
This paper aims to find errors that lead to dia-
logue breakdowns in chat-oriented dialogue sys-
tems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) identify error
types in chat-oriented dialogue systems, and (2)
calculate their impact on dialogue breakdown. For
(1), we first collect chat dialogues between an au-
tomated system and users, annotate the dialogues
with dialogue breakdown labels, and collect com-
ments that describe the error that led to the break-
downs. After that, we apply automatic cluster-
ing methods to the comments to obtain clusters of
comments, each of which corresponds to a partic-
ular error type. For (2), we calculate the correla-
tion between an error type and the degree of dia-
logue breakdown it incurs. This way, we can quan-
tify the impact of an error type on dialogue break-
down. By our approach, we hope to distinguish
fatal errors from non-fatal ones, providing useful
guidelines for dialogue system developers to avoid
breakdowns in chat-oriented dialogue systems.
2 Data Collection
For data collection, we asked dialogue researchers
and their collaborators in Japan to use our chat-
oriented dialogue system. The system is text-
based and enables chatting in Japanese. It was
built by wrapping a chat API provided by NTT
DOCOMO (Onishi and Yoshimura, 2014). Since
the API works on the basis of (Higashinaka et al.,
2014), which uses a number of natural language
processing techniques to understand and generate
utterances, we expected to obtain a wide variety of
dialogues, and hence, a variety of errors.
A total of 116 users chatted with the system, re-
sulting in 1,146 dialogues. Here, each dialogue
was controlled to be 21 utterances long: one sys-
tem prompt with ten utterances each from the
user and system. Then, we randomly sampled
100 dialogues (called the init100 data set) for di-
alogue breakdown annotation. Twenty-four anno-
tators subjectively labeled each system utterance
in init100 with one of the following three dialogue
breakdown labels:
(NB) Not a breakdown: The conversation is
easy to continue after the system utterance in
question.
(PB) Possible breakdown: The conversation is
difficult to continue smoothly after the sys-
tem utterance in question.

Figure 1: Example dialogue with the number of breakdown labels for each system utterance. S and U
stand for system and user utterances, respectively. C stands for the number of comments provided. The
dialogue was originally in Japanese and was translated by the authors.
(B) Breakdown: The conversation is difficult to
continue at all after the system utterance in
question.
The annotators were instructed to provide volun-
tary comments to describe the errors that led to the
breakdowns. Table 1 shows the statistics of the di-
alogue breakdown labels and comments. Figure
1 shows an example dialogue with the number of
breakdown labels and comments for each system
utterance. In this example, S5 and S6 were anno-
tated with nine and eleven breakdown labels, re-
spectively, both having four comments.
The inter-annotator agreement of dialogue
breakdown annotation in Fleiss’ kappa was 0.276,
which seems relatively low. One reason for this
is obviously the subjective nature of the task. An-
other possible reason is that we intentionally did
not set rigid guidelines for dialogue breakdown
annotation so as to explore possible error types in
chat-oriented dialogue systems. When we merge
PB and B and make it a two-class annotation, the
agreement becomes 0.396 (moderate agreement),
showing that the subjects share some common
conception about dialogue breakdown.

3 Analysis
3.1 Automatic clustering of comments
We first need to identify the error types in chat-
oriented dialogue systems. For this, we applied
an automatic clustering method to the comments
to obtain clusters of comments. Our idea is that,
since each comment describes a particular error
that led to a breakdown, a cluster of comments is
likely to represent an error type. Since the num-
ber of clusters is difficult to know in advance, we
turn to a non-parametric Bayesian method called
the Chinese restaurant process (CRP) as a cluster-
ing method. CRP can infer the number of clusters
automatically from data (Pitman, 1995).
We applied CRP to the 1,511 comments given
2244
ID Size Interpretation Representative words in the cluster
2 259 General quality dialogue, well-formed, consideration, conversation
0 194 Not understandable understand, meaning, what
6 148 Ignore user utterance ignore, user, utterance
7 134 Ignore user question answer, question, partner, respond
1 113 Unclear intention unclear, intention, meaning, utterance
8 107 Contradiction doubtful, change, negative (as opposed to positive), previous
16 100 Analysis failure analysis, recognition, related, understand
4 95 Inappropriate answer response, inappropriate, invalid, answer
5 77 Repetition say, add, mind, strange, tired
3 54 Grammatical error (words specific to particular grammar usage)
14 53 Expression error (words specific to particular expressions)
11 39 Topic-change error change, topic, sudden, mismatch, response
12 38 Violation of common sense match, flow, common sense, against, connection
13 36 Word usage error (words specific to particular word usage)
10 35 Diversion story, different
15 25 Mismatch in conversation match, story
9 4 Social error (no words)
Table 2: Clusters by CRP of 1,511 comments given to breakdowns. The clusters are ordered by size.
to breakdown labels (B labels). For the clustering,
we used the same procedure as (Higashinaka et al.,
2011); each datum (comment) was represented by
a word frequency vector, and the probability that
it belonged to a particular cluster was calculated
by using the likelihood that the words are gener-
ated from the word distribution of that cluster. The
hyper-parameters ? and ? were both set to 0.1 and
the number of iterations for Gibbs sampling was
10,000. See (Higashinaka et al., 2011) for the de-
tails of the procedure.
Table 2 shows the clustering results. We ob-
tained 17 clusters. For each cluster, we mined
representative words by a log-likelihood ratio test,
which uses a two-by-two matrix to test the inde-
pendence of a word to a particular cluster. By
looking at the representative words and also the
raw comments, we came up with the interpreta-
tions of the clusters as indicated in the table. Al-
though we do not go into the details of the clus-
ters one by one, each cluster seems to success-
fully represent a certain error type in chat-oriented
dialogue systems. We also applied CRP to the
3,329 comments given to PB and B to obtain sim-
ilar clusters except that we additionally had clus-
ters whose interpretations are as follows: inability
to handle invalid user input, missing topic, miss-
ing information, mismatch in response, no reac-
tion, and no information. They account for about
13.3% of the comments and mostly concern miss-
ing elements (such as missing arguments) in dia-
logue. Since such missing elements can be com-
plemented by follow-on utterances in dialogue,
they only appear in the comments for PB; they do
not lead to an immediate dialogue breakdown.
To further categorize the clusters, we applied a
hierarchical clustering (an agglomerative cluster-
ing) to the clusters. Here, a cluster was represented
by the word frequency vector of all comments con-
tained in the cluster, and the similarity of the clus-
ters was calculated by cosine similarity of word
frequency vectors. For the linkage criterion, we
used Ward’s method. Figure 2 shows the cluster-
ing results. The figure indicates that there are the
following eight main error categories (E1–E8):
(E1) Clusters 2 and 16 concern the general ability
of a system.
(E2) Clusters 7, 5, and 8 relate to context aware-
ness: the ability to recognize when it is asked
a question and to recognize what has been
said before.
(E3) Clusters 13, 3, and 14 concern the language
generation (surface realization) ability.
(E4) Clusters 4 and 6 concern the response abil-
ity: the ability to answer questions and to cre-
ate utterances relevant to the previous user ut-
terance.
(E5) Cluster 1 relates to the exhibition of an in-
tention or a plan: the ability to make clear the

purpose of an utterance.
(E6) Clusters 9 and 12 relate to the social ability:
the ability not to offend users or say things
that are not socially acceptable.
(E7) Clusters 0 and 15 concern the understand-
ability of an utterance: the ability to gener-
ate utterances that have clear meanings in the
context of the conversation.
(E8) Clusters 10 and 11 relate to the awareness of
current topics.
3.2 Analyzing the impact of error types
Having identified the error types and error cate-
gories, we investigated their impact on dialogue
breakdown. For this purpose, we examined the
correlation between an error type and its degree
of breakdown: the higher the correlation, the more
it is related to dialogue breakdown. Specifically,
we calculated the correlation ratio (?) between the
existence of a comment belonging to a particular
cluster (error type) and the number of breakdown
labels (B labels). Note that the correlation ratio

9 Social error E6 0.10
10 Diversion E8 0.09
11 Topic-change error E8 0.06
15 Mismatch in conversation E7 0.06
14 Expression error E3 0.02
Table 3: Correlation ratio (?) between the exis-
tence of a comment of a cluster (error type) and
the number of breakdown labels. “Cat” denotes
the error category of an error type.
is equivalent to Pearson’s correlation coefficient
except that it can be applied to categorical data.
The ? ranges from 0 to 1. For calculation, we first
extracted data that had one or more B labels and
one or more corresponding comments (we had 556
such samples in our data). Then, we calculated the
correlation ratios.
Table 3 shows the correlation ratios for the er-
ror types. Clearly, not all error types have the
same level of correlation. At the top of the ta-
ble, there are four salient error types with similar ?
values: “Not understandable”, “Ignore user ques-
tion”, “General quality”, and “Unclear intention”.
Putting aside “General quality”, which seems to
concern the overall dialogue ability, the error types
that we need to consider as fatal would seem to be
the other three. Other errors seem to be less im-
portant with lower ? values. “Expression error”,
which concerns the use of unnatural expressions,
was found the least important.
When we look at the error categories, we can
see an interesting result that it is NOT the error cat-
egory that determines the fatality of errors but the
specificity of error types. For example, “Not un-
derstandable” and “Mismatch in conversation” are
both under error category E7 but have totally dif-
ferent effects on perceived breakdown. The same
can be said for error types in E2.
2246
Note that, although the values of correlation ra-
tio seem rather low, the correlation often becomes
low when it comes to subjective judgments (Hi-
gashinaka et al., 2004). Considering that we deal
with chat-oriented dialogues, which are less re-
stricted than task-oriented ones, we consider the
current values of correlation ratio to be accept-
able. Here, the important finding is that several
error types are comparatively more important than
the others.
4 Related work
Few studies have analyzed breakdowns in conver-
sation. One exception is the study by Martinovsky
and Traum (2003), who discussed possible causes
of breakdowns they observed. Our work is differ-
ent in that we systematically identify error types
and quantitatively evaluate their effect. Our work
can be seen as listing up errors in dialogue sys-
tems. A number of studies have aimed to create a
taxonomy of errors (Bernsen et al., 1996; M¨oller,
2002; Paek, 2003), but their taxonomies are cre-
ated manually and focus on task-oriented dialogue
systems.
5 Summary and future work
By processing dialogue data with dialogue break-
down annotations and comments, this paper iden-
tified 17 error types that can be further categorized
into eight error categories. By calculating corre-
lation ratios, we discovered three error types that
can be fatal: “Not understandable”, “Ignore user
question”, and “Unclear intention”. To avoid dia-
logue breakdowns, it is suggested that we need to
make clear the meanings of system utterances, not
ignore user questions, and show some intention
behind system utterances. The findings will be
useful for dialogue system developers who want
to realize smooth human-machine interaction in
chat-oriented dialogue systems and possibly in di-
alogue design as a whole.
For future work, we plan to consider ways to
improve systems on the basis of our findings and
also verify the generality of the results on data
using other systems. To accurately detect dia-
logue breakdowns, dialogue systems researchers
will need to collaborate. To this end, we are plan-
ning to organize an evaluation workshop on dia-
logue breakdown detection. For use in the eval-
uation workshop as well as in dialogue research
in general, we have released our data with all the
annotations and comments to the public.
