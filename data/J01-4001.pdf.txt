Anaphora accounts for cohesion in texts and is a phenomenon under active study 
in formal and computational linguistics alike. The correct interpretation of anaphora 
is vital for natural anguage processing (NLP). For example, anaphora resolution is 
a key task in natural anguage interfaces, machine translation, text summarization, 
information extraction, question answering, and a number of other NLP applications. 
After considerable initial research, followed by years of relative silence in the early 
1980s, anaphora resolution has attracted the attention of many researchers in the last 10 
years and a great deal of successful work on the topic has been carried out. Discourse- 
oriented theories and formalisms uch as Discourse Representation Theory and Cen- 
tering Theory inspired new research on the computational treatment of anaphora. The 
drive toward corpus-based robust NLP solutions further stimulated interest in alterna- 
tive and/or data-enriched approaches. Last, but not least, application-driven research 
in areas uch as automatic abstracting and information extraction i dependently high- 
lighted the importance of anaphora nd coreference r solution, boosting research in 
this area. 
Much of the earlier work in anaphora resolution heavily exploited omain and lin- 
guistic knowledge (Sidner 1979; Carter 1987; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Carbonell and 
Brown 1988), which was difficult both to represent and to process, and which required 
considerable human input. However, the pressing need for the development of robust 
and inexpensive solutions to meet the demands of practical NLP systems encouraged 
many researchers tomove away from extensive domain and linguistic knowledge and 
to embark instead upon knowledge-poor anaphora resolution strategies. A number of 
proposals in the 1990s deliberately imited the extent o which they relied on domain 
and/or linguistic knowledge and reported promising results in knowledge-poor per- 
ational environments (Dagan and Itai 1990, 1991; Lappin and Leass 1994; Nasukawa 
1994; Kennedy and Boguraev 1996; Williams, Harvey, and Preston 1996; Baldwin 1997; 
Mitkov 1996, 1998b). 
The drive toward knowledge-poor and robust approaches was further motivated 
by the emergence of cheaper and more reliable corpus-based NLP tools such as part- 
of-speech taggers and shallow parsers, alongside the increasing availability of corpora 
and other NLP resources (e.g., ontologies). In fact, the availability of corpora, both raw 
and annotated with coreferential links, provided a strong impetus to anaphora resolu-

tion with regard to both training and evaluation. Corpora (especially when annotated) 
are an invaluable source not only for empirical research but also for automated learning 
(e.g., machine learning) methods aiming to develop new rules and approaches; they 
also provide an important resource for evaluation of the implemented approaches. 
From simple co-occurrence rules (Dagan and Itai 1990) through training decision trees 
to identify anaphor-antecedent pairs (Aone and Bennett 1995) to genetic algorithms to 
optimize the resolution factors (Or~san, Evans, and Mitkov 2000), the successful per- 
formance of more and more modern approaches was made possible by the availability 
of suitable corpora. 
While the shift toward knowledge-poor strategies and the use of corpora repre- 
sented the main trends of anaphora resolution in the 1990s, there are other signifi- 
cant highlights in recent anaphora resolution research. The inclusion of the corefer- 
ence task in the Sixth and Seventh Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6 and 
MUC-7) gave a considerable impetus to the development of coreference resolution 
algorithms and systems, such as those described in Baldwin et al. (1995), Gaizauskas 
and Humphreys (1996), and Kameyama (1997). The last decade of the 20th century 
saw a number of anaphora resolution projects for languages other than English such as 
French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish. Against the background 
of a growing interest in multilingual NLP, multilingual anaphora/coreference reso- 
lution has gained considerable momentum in recent years (Aone and McKee 1993; 
Azzam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998; Harabagiu and Maiorano 2000; Mitkov 
and Barbu 2000; Mitkov 1999; Mitkov and Stys 1997; Mitkov, Belguith, and Stys 1998). 
Other milestones of recent research include the deployment of probabilistic and ma- 
chine learning techniques (Aone and Bennett 1995; Kehler 1997; Ge, Hale, and Char- 
niak 1998; Cardie and Wagstaff 1999; the continuing interest in centering, used either 
in original or in revised form (Abra~os and Lopes 1994; Strube and Hahn 1996; Hahn 
and Strube 1997; Tetreault 1999); and proposals related to the evaluation methodology 
in anaphora resolution (Mitkov 1998a, 2001b). For a more detailed survey of the state 
of the art in anaphora resolution, see Mitkov (forthcoming). 
The papers published in this issue reflect he major trends in anaphora resolution 
in recent years. Some of them describe approaches that do not exploit full syntactic 
knowledge (as in the case of Palomar et al.'s and Stuckardt's work) or that employ 
machine learning techniques (Soon, Ng, and Lira); others present centering-based pro- 
noun resolution (Tetreault) or discuss theoretical centering issues (Kibble). Almost all 
of the papers feature extensive valuation (including comparative valuation as in 
the case of Tetreault's and Palomar et al.'s work) or discuss general evaluation issues 
(Byron as well as Stuckardt). 
Palomar et al.'s paper describes an approach that works from the output of a 
partial parser and handles third person personal, demonstrative, reflexive, and zero 
pronouns, featuring among other things syntactic onditions on Spanish NP-pronoun 
noncoreference and an enhanced set of resolution preferences. The authors also im- 
plement several known methods and compare their performance with that of their 
own algorithm. An indirect conclusion from this work is that an algorithm requires 
semantic knowledge in order to hope for a success rate higher than 75%. 
Soon, Ng, and Lira describe a C5-based learning approach to coreference resolu- 
tion of noun phrases in unrestricted text. The approach learns from a small, annotated 
corpus and tackles pronouns, proper names, and definite descriptions. The coreference 
resolution module is part of a larger coreference resolution system that also includes 
sentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, 
noun phrase identification, named entity recognition, and semantic lass determina- 
tion (via WordNet). The evaluation is carried out on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 test

corpora. The paper reports on experiments aimed at quantifying the contribution of 
each resolution factor and features error analysis. 
Stuckardt's work presents an anaphor esolution algorithm for systems where only 
partial syntactic information is available. Stuckardt applies Government and Bind- 
ing Theory principles A, B, and C to the task of coreference resolution on partially 
parsed texts. He also argues that evaluation of anaphora resolution systems hould 
take into account several factors beyond simple accuracy of resolution. In particular, 
both developer-oriented (e.g., related to the selection of optimal resolution factors) 
and application-oriented (e.g., related to the requirement of the application, as in the 
case of information extraction, where a proper name antecedent is needed) evaluation 
metrics should be considered. 
Tetreault's contribution features comparative valuation involving the author's 
own centering-based pronoun resolution algorithm called the Left-Right Centering 
algorithm (LRC) as well as three other pronoun resolution methods: Hobbs's naive 
algorithm (Hobbs 1978), BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987), and Strube's S- 
list approach (Strube 1998). The LRC is an alternative to the original BFP algorithm in 
that it processes utterances incrementally. It works by first searching for an antecedent 
in the current sentence; if none can be found, it continues the search on the Cf-list of 
the previous and the other preceding utterances in a left-to-right fashion. 
In her squib, Byron maintains that additional kinds of information should be 
included in an evaluation in order to make the performance of algorithms on pronoun 
resolution more transparent. In particular, she suggests that the pronoun coverage be 
explicitly reported and proposes that the evaluation details be presented in a concise 
and compact tabular format called standard isclosure. Byron also proposes ameasure, 
the resolution rate, which is computed as the number of pronouns resolved correctly 
divided by the number of (only) referential pronouns. 
Finally, in his squib Kibble discusses a reformulation of the centering transitions 
(Continue, Retain, and Shift), which specify the center movement across sentences. 
Instead of defining a total preference ordering, Kibble argues that a partial ordering 
emerges from the interaction among cohesion (maintaining the same center), salience 
(realizing the center as subject), and cheapness (realizing the anticipated center of a 
following utterance as subject). 
The last years have seen considerable advances in the field of anaphora resolution, 
but a number of outstanding issues either remain unsolved or need more attention 
and, as a consequence, represent major challenges to the further development of the 
field (Mitkov 2001a). A fundamental question that needs further investigation is how 
far the performance of anaphora resolution algorithms can go and what the limitations 
of knowledge-poor methods are. In particular, more research should be carried out on 
the factors influencing the performance of these algorithms. One of the impediments 
to the evaluation or fuller utilization of machine learning techniques is the lack of 
widely available corpora annotated for anaphoric or coreferential links. More work 
toward the proposal of consistent and comprehensive evaluation is necessary; so too 
is work in multilingual contexts. Some of these challenges have been addressed in the 
papers published in this issue, but ongoing research will continue to address them in 
the near future.
