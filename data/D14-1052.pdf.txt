Abstract
This paper introduces a model of multiple-
instance learning applied to the predic-
tion of aspect ratings or judgments of
specific properties of an item from user-
contributed texts such as product reviews.
Each variable-length text is represented by
several independent feature vectors; one
word vector per sentence or paragraph.
For learning from texts with known as-
pect ratings, the model performs multiple-
instance regression (MIR) and assigns im-
portance weights to each of the sentences
or paragraphs of a text, uncovering their
contribution to the aspect ratings. Next,
the model is used to predict aspect ratings
in previously unseen texts, demonstrating
interpretability and explanatory power for
its predictions. We evaluate the model on
seven multi-aspect sentiment analysis data
sets, improving over four MIR baselines
and two strong bag-of-words linear mod-
els, namely SVR and Lasso, by more than
10% relative in terms of MSE.
1 Introduction
Sentiment analysis of texts provides a coarse-
grained view of their overall attitude towards an
item, either positive or negative. The recent abun-
dance of user texts accompanied by real-valued la-
bels e.g. on a 5-star scale has contributed to the de-
velopment of automatic sentiment analysis of re-
views of items such as movies, books, music or
other products, with applications in social com-
puting, user modeling, and recommender systems.
The overall sentiment of a text towards an item
often results from the ratings of several specific
aspects of the item. For instance, the author of
a review might have a rather positive sentiment
about a movie, having particularly liked the plot
and the music, but not too much the actors. De-
termining the ratings of each aspect automatically
is a challenging task, which may seem to require
the engineering of a large number of features de-
signed to capture each aspect. Our goal is to put
forward a new feature-agnostic solution for ana-
lyzing aspect-related ratings expressed in a text,
thus aiming for a finer-grained, deeper analysis of
text meaning than overall sentiment analysis.
Current state-of-the-art approaches to sentiment
analysis and aspect-based sentiment analysis, at-
tempt to go beyond word-level features either by
using higher-level linguistic features such as POS
tagging, parsing, and knowledge infusion, or by
learning features that capture syntactic and seman-
tic dependencies between words. Once an appro-
priate feature space is found, the ratings are typi-
cally modeled using a linear model, such as Sup-
port Vector Regression (SVR) with `
2
norm for
regularization or Lasso Regression with `
1
norm.
By treating a text globally, these models ignore the
fact that the sentences of a text have diverse con-
tributions to the overall sentiment or to the attitude
towards a specific aspect of an item.
In this paper, we propose a new learning model
which answers the following question: “To what
extent does each part of a text contribute to the
prediction of its overall sentiment or the rating of
a particular aspect?” The model uses multiple-
instance regression (MIR), based on the assump-
tion that not all the parts of a text have the same
contribution to the prediction of the rating. Specif-
ically, a text is seen as a bag of sentences (in-
stances), each of them modeled as a word vector.
The overall challenge is to learn which sentences
refer to a given aspect, and how they contribute to
the text’s attitude towards it, but the model applies
to overall sentiment analysis as well. For instance,
Figure 1 displays a positive global comment on a
TED talk and the weights assigned to two of its
sentences by MIR.
455
Figure 1: Analysis of a comment (bag of sentences
{s
1
, ..., s
j
}) annotated by humans with the maxi-
mal positive sentiment score (5 stars). The weights
assigned by MIR reveal that s
1
has the greatest rel-
evance to the overall sentiment.
Using regularized least squares, we formulate
an optimization objective to jointly assign instance
weights and regression hyperplane weights. Then,
an instance relevance estimation method is used
to predict aspect ratings, or global ones, in previ-
ously unseen texts. The parameters of the model
are learned using an alternating optimization pro-
cedure inspired by Wagstaff and Lane (2007). Our
model requires only text with ratings for training,
with no particular assumption on the word fea-
tures to be extracted, and provides interpretable
explanations of the predicted ratings through the
relevance weights assigned to sentences. We also
show that the model has reasonable computational
demands. The model is evaluated on aspect and
sentiment rating prediction over seven datasets:
five of them contain reviews with aspect labels
about beers, audiobooks and toys (McAuley et al.,
2012), and two contain TED talks with emotion la-
bels, and comments on them with sentiment labels
(Pappas and Popescu-Belis, 2013). Our model
outperforms previous MIR models and two strong
linear models for rating prediction, namely SVR
and Lasso by more than 10% relative in terms of
MSE. The improvement is observed even when the
sophistication of the feature space increases.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
shows how our model innovates with respect to
previous work on MIR and rating prediction. Sec-
tion 3 formulates the problem while Section 4 de-
scribes previous MIR models. Section 5 presents
our MIR model and learning procedure. Section 6
presents the datasets and evaluation methods. Sec-
tion 7 reports our results on rating prediction tasks,
and provides examples of rating explanation.
2 Related Work
2.1 Multiple-Instance Regression
Multiple-instance regression (MIR) belongs to the
class of multiple-instance learning (MIL) prob-
lems for real-valued output, and it is a variant
of multiple regression where each data point may
be described by more than one vectors of values.
Many MIL studies focused on classification (An-
drews et al., 2003; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007;
Settles et al., 2008; Foulds and Frank, 2010; Wang
et al., 2011) while fewer focused on regression
(Ray and Page, 2001; Davis and others, 2007;
Wagstaff et al., 2008; Wagstaff and Lane, 2007).
Related to document analysis, several MIR stud-
ies have focused on news categorization (Zhang
and Zhou, 2008; Zhou et al., 2009) or web-index
recommendation (Zhou et al., 2005) but, to our
knowledge, no study has attempted to use MIR for
aspect rating prediction or sentiment analysis with
real-valued labels.
MIR was firstly introduced by Ray et al. (2001),
proposing an EM algorithm which assumes that
one primary instance per bag is responsible for
its label. Wagstaff and Lane (2007) proposed to
simultaneously learn a regression model and es-
timate instance weights per bag for crop yield
modeling (not applicable to prediction). A simi-
lar method which learns the internal structure of
bags using clustering was proposed by Wagstaff et
al. (2008) for crop yield prediction, and we will
use it for comparison in the present study. Later,
the method was adapted to map bags into a single-
instance feature space by Zhang et al. (2009).
Wang et al. (2008) assumed that each bag is gener-
ated by random noise around a primary instance,
while Wang et al. (2012) represented bag labels
with a probabilistic mixture model. Foulds et
al. (2010) concluded that various assumptions are
differently suited to different tasks, and should be
stated clearly when describing an MIR model.
2.2 Rating Prediction from Text
Sentiment analysis aims at analyzing the polar-
ity of a given text, either with classification (for
discrete labels) or regression (for real-valued la-
bels). Early studies introduced machine learning
techniques for sentiment classification, e.g. Pang
et al. (2002), including unsupervised techniques
based on the notion of semantic orientation of
phrases, e.g. Turney et al. (2002). Other studies
focused on subjectivity detection, i.e. whether a
456
text span expresses opinions or not (Wiebe et al.,
2004). Rating inference was defined by Pang et
al. (2005) as multi-class classification or regres-
sion with respect to rating scales. Pang and Lee
(2008) discusses the large range of features engi-
neered for this task, though several recent stud-
ies focus on feature learning (Maas et al., 2011;
Socher et al., 2011), including the use of a deep
neural network (Socher et al., 2013). In contrast,
we do not make any assumption about the nature
or dimensionality of the feature space.
The fine-grained analysis of opinions regarding
specific aspects or features of items is known as
multi-aspect sentiment analysis. This task usu-
ally requires aspect-related text segmentation, fol-
lowed by prediction or summarization (Hu and
Liu, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2006). Most attempts to
perform this task have engineered various feature
sets, augmenting words with topic or content mod-
els (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008;
Sauper et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2011), or with lin-
guistic features (Pang and Lee, 2005; Baccianella
et al., 2009; Qu et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2012).
Other studies have advocated joint modeling of
multiple aspects (Snyder and Barzilay, 2007) or
multiple reviews for the same product (Li et al.,
2011). McAuley et al. (2012) introduced new cor-
pora of multi-aspect reviews, which we also partly
use here, and proposed models for aspect detec-
tion, sentiment summarization and rating predic-
tion. Lastly, joint aspect identification and senti-
ment classification have been used for aggregating
product review snippets by Sauper at al. (2013).
None of the above studies considers the multiple-
instance property of text in their modeling.
3 MIR Definition
Let us consider a set B of m bags with
numerical labels Y as input data D =
{({b
1j
}
d
n
1
, y
1
), ..., ({b
mj
}
d
n
m
, y
m
)}, where b
ij
?
R
d
(for 1 ? j ? n
i
) and y
i
? R. Each bag
B
i
consists of n
i
data points (called ‘instances’),
hence it is a matrix of n
i
d-dimensional vectors,
e.g. word vectors. The challenge is to infer the
label of the bag given a variable number of in-
stances n
i
. This requires finding a set of bag rep-
resentations X = {x
1
, . . . , x
m
} of size m where
x
i
? R
d
, from which the class labels can be com-
puted. The goal is then to find a mapping from
this representation, noted ? : R
d
? R, which is
able to predict the label of a given bag. Ideally,
assuming that X is the best bag representation for
our task, we look for the optimal regression hyper-
plane ? which minimizes a loss function L plus a
regularization term ? as follows:
? = arg min
?
(
L(Y,X,?)
? ?? ?
loss
+ ?(?)
? ?? ?
reg.
)
(1)
Since the best set of representationsX for a task is
generally unknown, one has to make assumptions
to define it or compute it jointly with the regres-
sion hyperplane ?. Thus, the main difficulty lies
in finding a good assumption for X , as we will
now discuss.
4 Previous MIR Assumptions
We describe here three assumptions frequently
made in past MIR studies, to which we will later
compare our model: aggregating all instances,
keeping them as separate examples, or choosing
the most representative one (Wang et al., 2012).
For each assumption, we will experiment with
two state-of-the-art regression models (noted ab-
stractly as f ), namely SVR (Drucker et al., 1996)
and Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) with respectively the
`
2
and `
1
norms for regularization.
The Aggregated algorithm assumes that each
bag is represented as a single d-dimensional vec-
tor, which is the average of its instances (hence
x
i
? R
d
). Then, a regression model f is trained
on pairs of vectors and class labels, D
agg
=
{(x
i
, y
i
) | i = 1, . . . ,m}, and the predicted class
of an unlabeled bag B
i
= {b
ij
| j = 1, . . . , n
i
} is
computed as follows:
yˆ(B
i
) = f(mean({b
ij
| j = 1, . . . , n
i
})) (2)
In fact, a simple sum can also be used instead of
the mean, and we observed in practice that with an
appropriate regularization there is no difference on
the prediction performance between these options.
This baseline corresponds to the typical approach
for text regression tasks, where each text sample is
represented by a single vector in the feature space
(e.g. BOW with counts or TF-IDF weights).
The Instance algorithm considers each of the in-
stances in a bag as separate examples, by labeling
each of them with the bag’s label. A regression
model f is learned over the training set made of
all vectors of all bags, D
ins
= {(b
ij
, y
i
) | j =
1, . . . , n
i
; i = 1, . . . ,m}, assuming that there are
m labeled bags. To label a new bag B
i
, given that
457
there is no representation x
i
, the method simply
averages the predicted labels of its instances:
yˆ(B
i
) = mean({f(b
ij
) | j = 1, . . . , n
i
}) (3)
Instead of the average, the median value can also
be used, which is more appropriate when the bags
contain outlying instances.
The Prime algorithm assumes that a single in-
stance in each bag is responsible for its label (Ray
and Page, 2001). This instance is called the pri-
mary or prime one. The method is similar to the
previous one, except that only one instance per bag
is used as training data: D
pri
= {(b
p
i
, y
i
) | i =
1, . . . ,m}, where b
p
i
is the prime instance of the
i
th
bag B
i
and m is the number of bags. The
prime instances are discovered through an itera-
tive algorithm which refines the regression model
f . Given an initial model f , in each iteration the
algorithm selects from each bag a prime candidate
which is the instance with the lowest prediction er-
ror. Then, a new model is trained over the selected
prime candidates, until convergence. For a new
bag, the target class is computed as in Eq. 3.
5 Proposed MIR Model
We propose a new MIR model which assigns in-
dividual relevance values (weights) to each in-
stance of a bag, thus making fewer simplifying
assumptions than previous models. We extend
instance-relevance algorithms such as (Wagstaff
and Lane, 2007) by supporting high-dimensional
feature spaces, as required for text regression, and
by predicting both the class label and the con-
tent structure of previously unseen (hence unla-
beled) bags. The former is achieved by minimiz-
ing a regularized least squares loss (RLS) instead
of solving normal equations, which is prohibitive
in large spaces. The latter represents a significant
improvement over Aggregated and Instance algo-
rithms, which are unable to pinpoint the most rel-
evant instances with respect to the label of each
bag, being thus applicable only to bag label pre-
diction. Similarly, Prime only identifies the prime
instance when the bag is already labeled. Instead,
our model learns an optimal method to aggregate
instances, rather than a pre-defined one, and al-
lows more degrees of freedom in the regression
model than previous ones. Moreover, the weight
of an instance is interpreted as its relevance both
in training and prediction.
5.1 Instance Relevance Assumption
Each bag defines a bounded region of a hyper-
plane orthogonal to the y-axis (the envelope of all
its points). The goal is to find a regression hy-
perplane that passes through each bag B
i
and to
predict its label by using at least one data point
x
i
within that bounded region. Thus, the point x
i
is a convex combination of the points in the bag,
in other words B
i
is represented by the weighted
average of its instances b
ij
:
x
i
=
n
i
?
j=1
?
ij
b
ij
, ?
ij
? 0 and
n
i
?
j=1
?
ij
= 1 (4)
where ?
ij
is the weight of the j
th
instance of the
i
th
bag. Each weight ?
ij
indicates the relevance
of an instance j to the prediction of the class y
i
of
the i
th
bag. The constraint forces x
i
to fall within
the bounded region of the points in bag i and guar-
antees that the i
th
bag will influence the regressor.
5.2 Modeling Bag Structure and Labels
Let us consider a set ofm bags, where each bagB
i
is represented by its n
i
d-dimensional instances,
i.e. B
i
= {b
ij
}
d
n
i
along with the set of target class
labels for each bag, Y = {y
i
}
N
, y
i
? R. The
representation set of all B
i
in the feature space,
X = {x
1
, . . . , x
m
}, x
i
? R
d
, is obtained using
the n
i
instance weights associated to each bag B
i
,
?
i
= {?
ij
}
n
i
, ?
ij
? [0, 1] which are initially
unknown. Thus, we look for a linear regression
model f that is able to model the target values us-
ing the regression coefficients ? ? R
d
, where X
and Y are respectively the sets of training bags and
their labels: Y = f(X) = ?
T
X . We define a loss
function according to the least squares objective
dependent on X , Y , ? and the set of weight vec-
tors ? = {?
1
, . . . , ?
m
} using Eq. 4 as follows:
L(Y,X,?,?) = ||Y ? ?

ing `

terms
for each ?

The selection of the `
2
-norm was based on prelim-
inary results showing that it outperforms `
1
-norm.
Other combinations of p-norm regularization can
be explored for f
1
and f
2
, e.g. to learn sparser in-
stance weights and denser regression coefficients
or vice versa.
The above objective is non-convex and difficult
to optimize because the minimization is with re-
spect to all ?
1
, . . . , ?
m
and ? at the same time. As
indicated in Eq. 6 above, we will note f
1
a model
that is learned from the minimization only with re-
spect to ?
1
, . . . , ?
m
and f
2
a model obtained from
the minimization with respect to ? only. In Eq. 6,
we can observe that if one of the two is known or
held fixed, then the other one is convex and can be
learned with the well-known least squares solving
techniques. In Section 5.3, we will describe an al-
gorithm that is able to exploit this observation.
Having computed ?
1
, . . . , ?
m
and ?, we could
predict a label for an unlabeled bag using Eq. 3,
but would not be able to compute the weights
of the instances. Moreover, information that has
been learned about the instances during the train-
ing phase would not be used during prediction.
For these reasons, we introduce a third regression
model f
3
with regression coefficients O ? R
d
as-
suming a `
2
-norm for the regularization with 
3
term, which is trained on the relevance weights
obtained from the Eq. 6, D
w
= {(b
ij
, ?
ij
) | i =
1, ...,m; j = 1, ..., n
i
}. The optimization objec-
tive for the f

model is the following:

(7)
This minimization can be easily performed with
the well-known least squares solving techniques.
The learned model is able to estimate the weights
of the instances of an unlabeled bag during pre-
diction time as:
ˆ
?
i
= f
3
(B

) = ?
T
B
i
. The
ˆ
?
i
weights are estimations which are influenced by
the relevance weights learned in our minimization
objective of Eq. 6 but they are not constrained at
prediction time. To obtain interpretable weights,
we can convert the estimated scores to the [0, 1]
interval as follows:
ˆ
?
i
=
ˆ
?
i
/sum(
ˆ
?
i
). Finally,
the prediction of the label for the i
th
bag using the
estimated instance weights
ˆ
?

is done as follows:
yˆ = f

5.3 Learning with Alternating Projections
Algorithm 1 solves the non-convex optimization
problem of Eq. 6 by using a powerful class of
methods for finding the intersection of convex sets,
namely alternating projections (AP). The prob-
lem is firstly divided into two convex problems,
namely f
1
loss function and f
2
loss function,
which are then solved in an alternating fashion.
Like EM algorithms, AP algorithms do not have
general guarantees on their convergence rate, al-
though, in practice, we found it acceptable at gen-
erally fewer than 20 iterations.

i.e. when there is no more decrease on the training
error, or until a maximum number of iterations has
been reached. The regression model f

is trained
on the weights learned from the previous steps.
5.4 Complexity Analysis
The overall time complexity T of Algorithm 1 in
terms of the input variables, noted h = {m, nˆ, d},
with m being the number of bags, nˆ the average
size of the bags, and d the dimensionality of the
feature space (here, the size of word vectors), is
derived as follows:
T (h) = T
ap
(h) + T
f

)
= O
(

, (9)
where T
ap
and T
f
3
are respectively the time com-
plexity of the AP procedure and of training the f
3
model. Eq. 9 shows that when nˆ  m, the model
complexity is linear with the input bags m and al-
ways quadratic with the number of features d.
Previous works on relevance assignment for
MIR have prohibitive complexity for high-
dimensional feature spaces or numerous bags and
hence they are not most appropriate for text regres-
sion tasks. Wagstaff and Lane (2007) have cubic
time complexity with the average bag size nˆ and
number of features d; Zhou et al. (2009) use ker-
nels, thus their complexity is quadratic with the
number of bags m; and Wang et al. (2011) have
cubic time wrt. d. Our formulation is thus com-
petitive in terms of complexity.
6 Data, Protocol and Metrics
6.1 Aspect Rating Datasets
We use seven datasets summarized in Table 1.
Five publicly available datasets were built for as-
pect prediction by McAuley et al. (2012) – Beer-
Advocate, Ratebeer (ES), RateBeer (FR), Audio-
books and Toys & Games – and have aspect rat-
ings assigned by their creators on the respective
websites. On the set of comments on TED talks
from Pappas and Popescu-Belis (2013), we aim
to predict two things: talk-level emotion dimen-
sions assigned by viewers through voting, and
comment polarity scores assigned by crowdsourc-
ing. The distributions of aspect ratings per dataset
are shown in Figure 3. Five datasets are in En-
glish, one in Spanish (Ratebeer) and one in French
(RateBeer), so our results will also demonstrate
the language-independence of our method.
From every dataset we kept 1,200 texts as bags
of sentences, but we also used three full-size
datasets, namely Ratebeer ES (1,259 labeled re-
views), Ratebeer FR (17,998) and Audiobooks
(10,989). The features for each of them are word
vectors with binary attributes signaling word pres-
ence or absence, in a traditional bag-of-words
model (BOW). The word vectors are provided
with the first five datasets and we generated them
for the latter two, after lowercasing and stopword
removal. Moreover, for TED comments, we com-
puted TF-IDF scores using the same dimension-
ality as with BOW to experiment with a different
feature space. The target class labels were nor-
malized by the maximum rating in their scale, ex-
cept for TED talks where the votes were normal-
ized by the maximum number of votes over all the
emotion classes for each talk, and two emotions,
‘informative’ and ‘ok’, were excluded as they are
neutral ones.
6.2 Evaluation Protocol
We compare the proposed model, noted AP-
Weights, with four baseline ones – Aggre-
gated, Instance, Prime (Section 4) and Clus-

tering (from github.com/garydoranjr/
mcr), which is an instance relevance method pro-
posed by Wagstaff et al. (2008) for aspect rating
prediction. First, for each aspect class, we opti-
mize all methods on a development set of 25%
of the data (300 randomly selected bags). Then,
we perform 5-fold cross-validation for every as-
pect on each entire data set and report the average
error scores using the optimal hyper-parameters
per method. In addition, we report for compar-
ison the scores of AverageRating, which always
predicts the average rating over the training set.
We report standard error metrics for regression,
namely the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the
Mean Squared Error (MSE). The former measures
the average magnitude of errors in a set of predic-
tions while the latter measures the average of their
squares, which are defined over the test set of bags
B
i
respectively as MAE = (
?
k
i=1
|f(B
i
)?y
i
|)/k
and MSE = (
?
k
i=1
(f(B
i
) ? y
i
)
2
)/k. The cross-
validation scores are obtained by averaging the
MAE and MSE scores on each fold.
To find the optimal hyper-parameters for each
model, we perform 3-fold cross-validation on the
development set using exhaustive grid-search over
a fine-grained range of possible values and se-
lect the ones that perform best in terms of MAE.
The hyper-parameters to be optimized for the
baselines (except AverageRating) are the regular-
ization terms ?
2
, ?

of their possible regression
model f , namely SVR which uses the `
2
norm
and Lasso which uses the `
1
norm. As for AP-
Weights, it relies on three regularization terms,
namely 

, 

of the `
2
-norm for f
1
, f
2
and
f

regression models. Lastly, for the Clustering
baseline, we use the f
2
regression model, which
relies on 
2
and the number of clusters k, opti-
mized over {5, ..., 50} with step 5, for its cluster-
ing algorithm, here k-Means. All the regulariza-
tion terms are optimized over the same range of
possible values, noted a · 10
b
with a ? {1, . . . , 9}
and b ? {?4, . . . ,+4}, hence 81 values per term.
For the regression models and evaluation proto-
col, we use the scikit-learn machine learning li-
brary (Pedregosa et al., 2012). Our code and data
are available in the first author’s website.
7 Experimental Results
7.1 Aspect Rating Prediction
The results for aspect rating prediction are given
in Table 2. The proposed APWeights method
outperforms Aggregated (`
2
) and Aggregated (`
1
)
i.e. SVR and Lasso along with all other baselines
on each case. The SVR baseline has on average
11% lower performance than APWeights in terms
of MSE and about 6% in terms of MAE. Simi-
larly, the Lasso baseline has on average 13% lower
MSE and 8% MAE than APWeights. As shown
in Figure 4, APWeights also outperforms them for
each aspect in the five review datasets. The In-
stance method with `
1
performed well on BeerAd-
vocate and Toys & Games (for MSE), and with `
2
performed well on Ratebeer (ES), RateBeer (FR)
and Toys & Games (for MAE). Therefore, the
instance-as-example assumption is quite appropri-
ate for this task, however both options score be-
low APWeights – by about 5% MAE, and 8%/9%
MSE, respectively. The Prime method with `
1
per-
formed well only on the BeerAdvocate dataset and
Prime with `
2
only on the Toys & Games dataset,
always with lower scores than APWeights, namely
about 9% MAE for both and 15%/18% MSE re-
spectively. This suggests that the primary-instance

assumption is not the most appropriate for this
task. Lastly, even though Clustering is an instance
relevance method, it has similar scores to Prime,
presumably because the relevances are assigned
according to the computed clusters and they are
not directly influenced by the task’s objective.
To compare with the state-of-the-art results ob-
tained by McAuley et al. (2012), we experimented
with three of their full-size datasets. Splitting each
dataset in half for training vs. testing, and using
the optimal settings from our experiments above,
we measured the average MSE over all aspects.
APWeights improved over Lasso by 10%, 26%
and 17% MSE respectively on each dataset – the
absolute MSE scores are .038 for Lasso vs. .034
for APWeights on Ratebeer SP; .023 vs. .017 on
Ratebeer FR; .063 vs. .052 on Audiobooks. Sim-
ilarly, when compared to the best SVM baseline
provided by the McAuley et al., our method im-
proved by 32%, 43% and 35% respectively on
each dataset, though it did not use their rating
model. Moreover, the best model proposed by
McAuley et al., which uses a joint rating model
and an aspect-specific text segmenter trained on
hand-labeled data, reaches MSE scores of .03,
.02 and .03, which is comparable to our model
that does not use these features (.034, .017, .052),
though it could benefit from them in the future.
Lastly, as mentioned by the same authors, predic-
tors which use segmented text, for example with
topic models as in (Lu et al., 2011), do not neces-
sarly outperform SVR baselines; instead they have
marginal or even no improvements, therefore, we
did not further experiment with them. Interes-

7.2 Sentiment and Emotion Prediction
Our method is also competitive for sentiment pre-
diction over comments on TED talks, as well as
for talk-level emotion prediction with 12 dimen-
sions from subsets of 10 comments on each talk
(see Table 3). APWeights outperforms SVR and
Lasso, as well as all other methods for each task.
For sentiment prediction, SVR is outperformed by
11% MSE and Lasso by 5%. For emotion pre-

diction (averaged over all 12 aspects), differences
are smaller, at 1.6% and 2.9% respectively. These
smaller differences could be explained by the fact
that among the 10 most recent comments for each
talk, many are not related to the emotion that the
system tries to predict.
As mentioned earlier, the proposed model does
not make any assumption about the feature space.
Thus, we examined whether the improvements it
brings remain present even with a different fea-
ture space, for instance based on TF-IDF instead
of BOW with counts. For sentiment prediction on
TED comments, we found that by changing the
feature space to TF-IDF, strong baselines such as
Aggregated (`
1
) and (`
2
), i.e. SVR and Lasso, im-
prove their performance (16.25 and 16.59 MAE;
4.16 and 3.97 MSE respectively). However, AP-
Weights still outperforms them on both MAE and
MSE scores (15.35 and 3.63), improving over
SVR by 5.5% on MAE and 12.5% on MSE, and
over Lasso by 7.4% on MAE and 8.5% on MSE.
These promising results suggest that improve-
ments with APWeights could be observed also on
more sophisticated feature spaces.
7.3 Interpreting the Relevance Weights
Apart from predicting ratings, the MIR scores as-
signed by our model reflect the contribution of
each sentence to these predictions.
To illustrate the explanatory power of our model
(until a dataset for quantitative analysis becomes
available), we provide examples of predictions
on test data taken from the cross-validation folds
above. Table 5 displays the most relevant com-

that the sentences that convey the most sentiment
are assigned higher scores than sentences with less
sentiment, always with respect to the global polar-

APWeights has more degrees of freedom for inter-
pretation, it is able to assign relevance to parts of
a text (here, sentences) and even to words, while
other models can only consider words. Hence, the
assigned weights might be useful for other NLP
tasks mentioned below.
8 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper introduced a novel MIR model for as-
pect rating prediction from text, which learns in-
stance relevance together with target labels. To the
best of our knowledge, this has not been consid-
ered before. Compared to previous work on MIR,
the proposed model is competitive and more effi-
cient in terms of complexity. Moreover, it is not
only able to assign instance relevances on labeled
bags, but also to predict them on unseen bags.
Compared to previous work on aspect rating
prediction, our model performs significantly bet-
ter than BOW regression baselines (SVR, Lasso)
without using additional knowledge or features.
The improvements persist even when the sophis-
tication of the features increases, suggesting that
our contribution may be orthogonal to feature en-
gineering or learning. Lastly, the qualitative eval-
uation on test examples demonstrates that the pa-
rameters learned by the model are not only useful
for prediction, but they are also interpretable.
In the future, we intend to test our model on sen-
timent classification at the sentence-level, based
only on document-level supervision (T¨ackstr¨om
and McDonald, 2011). Moreover, we will experi-
ment with other model settings, such as regulariza-
tion norms other than `
2
and feature spaces other
than BOW or TF-IDF. In the longer term, we plan
to investigate new methods to estimate instance
weights at prediction time, and to evaluate the im-
pact of assigned weights on sentence ranking, seg-
mentation or summarization.
