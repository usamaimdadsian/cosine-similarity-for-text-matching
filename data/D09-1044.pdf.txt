Abstract
Experiments are reported that investi-
gate the effect of various source docu-
ment representations on the accuracy of
the sentence extraction phase of a multi-
document summarisation task. A novel
representation is introduced based on
generic relation extraction (GRE), which
aims to build systems for relation iden-
tification and characterisation that can be
transferred across domains and tasks with-
out modification of model parameters. Re-
sults demonstrate performance that is sig-
nificantly higher than a non-trivial base-
line that uses tf*idf -weighted words and at
least as good as a comparable but less gen-
eral approach from the literature. Anal-
ysis shows that the representations com-
pared are complementary, suggesting that
extraction performance could be further
improved through system combination.
1 Introduction
The goal of summarisation is to take an informa-
tion source, extract content from it, and present
the most important content in a condensed form
(Mani, 2001). The field of automatic summarisa-
tion (Mani, 2001; Sp¨arck Jones, 2007) aims to cre-
ate tools that address various summarisation tasks
with minimal human intervention. Extractive ap-
proaches to automatic summarisation create rep-
resentations of the source document that are gen-
erally based on an easily identified text sub-unit
such as sentences or paragraphs. These represen-
tations are then used to identify representative or
otherwise important snippets of text to place in the
summary.
Following Sp¨arck Jones (2007), summarisation
systems can be characterised with respect to their
approach to three main sub-tasks: 1) interpreta-
tion, 2) transformation and 3) generation. The
input consists of the source document (or a col-
lection of source documents in the case of multi-
document summarisation). The first step (interpre-
tation) creates a representation of the source doc-
ument by performing some level of interpretation.
A simple approach here represents sentences by
their tokens (i.e., as an unordered bag-of-words).
The next step (transformation) is the compaction
step where the source representation is converted
into the summary representation, e.g. by identify-
ing sentences whose words are most representative
of the full text. Finally, in the last step (genera-
tion), the output summary is created. In the case
of sentence extraction, this includes various opera-
tions to maximise coherence such as ensuring that
entity references are comprehensible and arrang-
ing the sentences in a sensible order.
The current work investigates several represen-
tations of source documents. In particular, an ap-
proach from the literature based on atomic events
(Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004) is compared
to a novel approach based on generic relation ex-
traction (GRE), which aims to build systems for
relation identification and characterisation that can
be transferred across domains and tasks without
modification of model parameters (Hachey, 2009).
The various representations are substituted in the
interpretation phase of a multi-document sum-
marisation task and used as the basis for extract-
ing sentences to be placed in the summary. Sys-
tem summaries are compared by calculating term
overlap with reference summaries created by hu-
man analysts.
2 Motivation
In seminal work on automatic summarisation,
Luhn (1958) introduces a representation based
on content words. These are defined as non-
function words from the source document that are
neither too frequent nor too infrequent. Luhn
uses frequency to weight content words and ex-
420
tracts sentences with the highest combined con-
tent scores to form the summary. Subsequent work
adapted the tf*idf weighting scheme, where term
frequency (tf ) is combined with inverse document
frequency (idf ), an inverse measure of term oc-
currence across documents that serves to down-
weight common words (Sp¨arck Jones, 1972). In
modern work, tf*idf representations are often used
as simple but non-trivial baselines. The problem
is that these shallow features often break down
where underlying linguistic content needs to be
compared rather than just surface structure.
The use of representations based on informa-
tion extraction (IE) has been suggested as one ap-
proach to capturing deeper semantic information.
This is based on the notion that IE definitions of
types for entities, relations and events provide a
level of abstraction that is appropriate for auto-
matic summarisation. Several approaches in the
literature have explored the use of IE-based rep-
resentations for extractive summarisation: McK-
eown et al. (1998) incorporate patient character-
istic templates for matching potential treatments
to specific patients in a medical summarisation
system; White and Cardie (2002) incorporate a
bootstrapped IE system based on Autoslog (Riloff,
1996) for filling event templates; and Harabagiu
and Maiorano (2002) incorporate a hybrid ap-
proach that uses conventional supervised IE tech-
niques for known topics and a more general ap-
proach based on WordNet for unknown topics.
1
The problem with these systems is that they all
use supervised approaches to IE that require that
the IE templates be known in advance and addi-
tionally require significant investment in writing
extraction rules or in annotating data for train-
ing. Where more general techniques are used, they
still require domain-specific resources, e.g. White
and Cardie (2002) bootstrapping approach still re-
quires that the extraction templates be known in
advance and Harabagiu and Maiorano (2002) ap-
proach depends on the WordNet lexical database,
for which coverage is not guaranteed for arbitrary
domains.
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) intro-
duce methods using more general IE represen-
tations that are not based on supervised learn-
ing. Given a named entity recogniser, the rep-
1
Comparable approaches using IE in the context of
abstractive–as opposed to extractive–summarisation include
work by DeJong (1982), Hahn and Reimer (1999), White et
al. (2001) and Saggion and Lapalme (2002).
resentation is automatically derived and consists
of <Ent,Connector, Ent> event triples, where
connectors are verbs or action nouns that occur in
between the two NEs. Thus, the approach aims to
perform a generic IE task that the authors refer to
as atomic event extraction. This representation is
shown to outperform a tf*idf baseline on a multi-
document summarisation task. As we will see in
Section 4.3 below, Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou’s
approach has three main shortcomings. First, it fo-
cuses exclusively on simple atomic events (i.e., en-
tity mention pairs with an intervening verbal con-
nector), meaning that it will not be able to ad-
dress tasks where relations are at least as impor-
tant as events (e.g., biographical summarisation).
Second, it relies on exact matching between con-
nectors, which is not capable of capturing latent
semantic similarities (e.g., between ‘work for’ and
‘employed by’). Third, its performance is subject
to the coverage of WordNet, which is used to iden-
tify action nouns.
Generic relation extraction (GRE) aims to build
systems that can be transferred across domains
and tasks without modification of model param-
eters (Hachey, 2009). For relation identification
(i.e., extraction of relation forming entity mention
pairs), this is achieved by using general rule-based
approaches and, for relation characterisation (i.e.,
assignment of types to relation mentions), this is
achieved by using unsupervised machine learning.
Hachey (2009) introduces a GRE approach that
addresses the shortcomings of the atomic event ap-
proach mentioned above. First, it models a type of
IE that includes relations. Second, it uses a con-
nector model based on latent Dirichlet allocation
(Blei et al., 2003), which provides a mechanism
for capturing latent semantic similarities between
connectors. Third, it does not rely on domain-
specific resource like WordNet. The GRE models
used here do rely on dependency parsing. How-
ever, they still generalise across formal domains
as the relation identification and characterisation
systems, developed on news data, achieve compa-
rable performance when applied directly to a rela-
tion extraction task in the biomedical domain (see
Hachey (2009) for details). Furthermore, gram-
matical relations obtained from dependency pars-
ing provide a means for constraining relation iden-
tification and supplying more linguistically mean-
ingful features for relation characterisation.

proach to automatic summarisation (Filatova and
Hatzivassiloglou, 2004).
3 Algorithm for Set Cover Extraction
For the sake of comparison, the current evaluation
adopts the Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004)
summarisation framework. This defines an extrac-
tion approach based on a mapping between textual
units and concepts. To illustrate, consider the ma-
trix in Table 1 where rows represent textual units
(e.g., sentences, paragraphs) and columns repre-
sent concepts (e.g., words, events, relations) in the
input text. Each concept is either absent or present
in a given textual unit. Additionally, each con-
cept has a weight associated with it. Looking at
the problem in this way makes it natural to for-
mulate it as follows: the summary should select
textual units such that there is maximal coverage
of the salient conceptual units.
2
This is essentially
the maximum coverage problem, which has been
shown to be reducible to the set covering problem,
for which there are approximation algorithms in
the literature that run in polynomial time or better
(Hochbaum, 1997; Bienstock and Iyengar, 2004).
Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou define several
greedy algorithms that can be parametrised in
terms of the general SUMMARISE function in Fig-
ure 1, which takes the text × concept matrix D
and the maximum summary length k as input. The
SUMMARISE function first initialises the summary
S to the empty set. Then it enters a loop that
continues until the summary reaches the desired
length. Within the loop, a text unit is extracted and
added to the summary after which the text × con-
cept matrix is updated The output of the algorithm
is a set S comprising the text units that make up
the summary. For the experiments reported here,
the text units t are sentences and LENGTH(t
i
) re-
2
While not considered in the current experiments, a more
discourse-oriented approach could be derived within the set
cover framework by down-weighting conceptual units that
occur e.g. in portions of the source documents that describe
background information, where text segments containing
background information could be identified using a sentence-
level rhetorical status classifier like that developed by Teufel
and Moens (2002).

The EXTRACT function first
identifies the concept c

not yet covered in the
summary that has the highest overall weight in the
text × concept matrix D. Then it selects the text
unit t
k
with the highest score from among the text
units that contain concept c

The UPDATE function in Figure 2 aims to min-
imise redundancy in the summary by globally
maximising the number of conceptual units cov-
ered in the output. In addition to removing the row
representing the extracted text unit from the text×
concept matrixD, it iterates through the remaining
text units and assigns zero weights to all concepts
that are covered by the extracted text unit.
3
The EXTRACT and UPDATE functions in Figure 2 corre-
spond to Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) modified adap-
tive algorithm and were found in preliminary experiments to
be the better than the simple greedy and adaptive greedy al-
gorithms (see Hachey (2009) for details).

4 Models
Figure 3 contains an example sentence and its rep-
resentations corresponding to the various models
of sentence content explored here.
4
These are de-
scribed in detail in the rest of this section.
4.1 Baseline tf*idf Representation (TF)
The baseline model represents sentences as tf*idf -
weighted bags-of-words (TF). Document frequen-
cies for terms are derived from the same resource
used by Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004)–a
frequency list compiled from a large sample of
web pages. Term weighting is calculated using
tf*idf as:
w(i, j) =
?
(1 + log (tf
i,j
)) ? log
(
N
df
i
)
(2)
where tf
i,j
is the number of times term i occurs in
sentence j and df
i
is the number of documents in
which term i occurs. An example sentence and its
tf*idf representation can be seen in Figure 3.
4
The sentence was selected from document set d47 (from
the data set described in Section 5.1 below), which contains
articles about Neil Bush and his role in the collapse of Sil-
verado Savings and Loan during the U.S. Savings and Loan
crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.
4.2 Event Representation (EV)
We also compare to Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou
(2004) atomic events (EV). This consists of
<Ent
i
, Connector
j
, Ent
k
> event triples, where
connectors are verbs or action nouns (i.e., nouns
that are hyponyms of event or activity in Word-
Net) that occur in between the two entity men-
tions. Given a named entity recogniser and a lex-
ical resource (WordNet), these are derived auto-
matically from the text as follows. In the first step,
all pairs of entity mentions that occur together in a
sentence are identified. Next, the algorithm char-
acterises the entity mention pairs using the con-
nector words from the intervening context and dis-
cards pairs without an intervening connector word.
Event triple weighting is calculated by combin-
ing entity pair and connector weights as:
w
ev
(i, j, k) = w
ne
(i, k) ? w
cn
(j, i, k) (3)
where w
ne
(i, k) is the weight of the entity
pair <i, k> consisting of entities i and k and
w
cn
(j, i, k) is the weight of connector j in the con-
text of entity pair <i, j>. w
ne
(i, k) is calculated
as the normalised entity pair count, i.e.:
w
ne
(i, k) =
C
ne
(< i, k >)
C
ne
(< ?, ? >)
(4)
where C
ne
(<i, k>) is the count of mentions of
entity pair <i, k>
5
and C
ne
(<?, ?>) is the total
count of entity mention pairs. And, w
cn
(j, i, k) is
calculated as the normalised count of connector j
in the context of the entity pair, i.e.:
w
cn
(j, i, k) =
C
<i,k>
cn
(j)
C
<i,k>
cn
(?)
(5)
where C
<i,k>
cn
(j) is the count of occurrences of
connector j in the context of entity pair <i, k>
and C
<i,k>
cn
(?) is the total count of connectors in
the context of entity pair <i, k>. An example
sentence and its event representation can be seen
in Figure 3. Event triples generated include
<PER bush,worked,ORG amoco> and
<PER bush,started,ORG jnb>.
Some erroneous event triples are also generated.
The first error has to do with the fact that entities
5
Coreference between entity mentions is computed by ex-
act string match after removing punctuation, converting to
all lower case, and prefixing the entity type. For example,
the entity mention string “JNB” with type ORGANISATION is
normalised to ORG jnb.
423
include named entities identified in the pre-
processing as well as the ten most frequent nouns
in the document set. In the example sentence from
Figure 3, the most frequent nouns include ‘oil’
but not ‘negotiator’ or ‘company’. Therefore, ‘oil’
is labelled as an entity and extracted in a num-
ber of triples such as <PER bush,worked,
XFN oil> (as opposed to <PER bush,
worked,XFN negotiator>). Another
problem illustrated by the example sentence has
to do with the noisy nature of the surface-level
approach to identifying entity mention pairs and
connectors which tends to generate many false
positive events, e.g. <ORG amoco,started,
ORG jnb>. If the algorithm was constrained
based on the underlying grammatical structure,
it should be able to identity that the arguments
of ‘worked’ are ‘Bush’ and ‘Amoco’ (i.e.,
<PER bush,worked,ORG amoco>) and that
‘worked’ does not describe an event involving
‘Amoco’ and ‘JNB’.
4.3 Relation Representation (RL)
The focus of the current evaluation is a novel rep-
resentation based on generic relation extraction
(GRE). As mentioned above, GRE is a minimally
supervised approach to the relation extraction task
that aims to build systems for relation identifica-
tion and characterisation that can be transferred
across domains and tasks without modification of
model parameters. Relation mentions are identi-
fied by taking pairs of entity mentions that have ei-
ther 1) no more than two intervening words in the
surface order of the sentence or 2) no more than
one edge intervening on the shortest path through
a dependency parse (see Hachey (2009) for details
and experiments comparing different window con-
figurations). This is stricter than the Filatova and
Hatzivassiloglou approach in that entity mentions
have to occur much closer or be connected by a
single dependency relation. At the same time, it
is less strict in the sense that an action- or event-
denoting word is not required in the context, which
makes it a more general model of IE.
Relation connectors are derived from amodel of
relation types based on latent Dirichlet allocation
(Blei et al., 2003) that incorporates word, entity
and dependency path features from the context of
a relation-forming entity mention pair (see Hachey
(2009) for details). This outputs a topic distribu-
tion for each entity mention pair that corresponds
to the type of relation that is described. This rep-
resentation 1) models a type of generic IE that in-
cludes relations, 2) uses a connector model that ab-
stracts away from surface-level event descriptors
used by Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) and
3) does not rely on domain-specific resources like
WordNet.
6
For the purpose of comparison, rela-
tion triples are weighted in the same way as event
triples using Equations 3 and 4 above. However,
the connector pair weighting is modified to use the
distribution over topics given by the LDA output.
7
Relation triples generated for the example
sentence in Figure 3 include <ORG amoco,
rd94,LOC denver> and <ORG amoco,
rd505,LOC denver>, where the connectors
(i.e., rd94 and rd505) are identifiers that index
particular topics from the LDA output. Here,
rd94 and rd505 index topics that correspond
to located-in relations so the respective triples
both describe located-in relations between Amoco
and Denver. Relation triples generated for the
example sentence also include <XFN oil,
rd92,ORG jnb> and <XFN oil,rd712,
ORG jnb>. These are erroneous for the same
reason as some of the event triples above (i.e., due
to the noise inherent in the approach to identifying
nominal entity mentions by identifying the ten
most frequent nouns in the document set).
4.4 Entity Pair Representations (EE, ER)
Finally, we investigate the performance of rep-
resentations that do not model event or re-
lation type information. These are identical
to the EV and RL representations above, ex-
cept they are <Ent,Ent> 2-tuples instead of
<Ent,Connector, Ent> 3-tuples. That is, entity
pairs are included here provided that they meet the
relation mention identification constraints. They
are weighted using the normalised entity pair
count (Equation 4 above). Relation-based entity
pairs generated for the example sentence in Fig-
ure 3 include<LOC denver,ORG amoco> and
<ORG jnb,XFN oil>.
6
The GRE representation here does rely on dependency
parsing, however, Hachey (2009) shows that it is still directly
portable between the news and biomedical domains without
modification of model parameters.
7
Distributions for entity mention pairs tend to have a long
uniform tail and only a few topics with higher probability. In
converting to a weighting scheme, topic representations here
are converted to a sparse representation where all topics in
the uniform tail are removed.
424
5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Data
The experiments here use the multi-document
summarisation data from the 2001 Document Un-
derstanding Conference (DUC),
8
which is the
same data used by Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou
(2004). This comprises 30 test document sets,
each of which include approximately 10 news sto-
ries. Each document set is collected by a human
and focuses on a particular topic. Example topics
include the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the
American Supreme Court, Neil Bush’s role in the
collapse of Silverado Savings and Loan and the
Exxon Valdez oil spill. Gold standard summaries
are provided for each document set for summary
lengths of 50, 100, 200 and 400 words. This helps
to ensure that the systems are not over-tuned to
specific summary lengths. For each summary task
(i.e., all 120 document set× summary length com-
binations), there are three distinct gold standard
summaries created by different human analysts.
Pre-processing includes sentence boundary
identification, segmentation of words (tokenisa-
tion), labelling words with part-of-speech tags,
identification of noninflected base word forms
(lemmatisation) from the LT-TTT tools (Grover et
al., 2000). It also includes dependency parsing us-
ing Minipar (Lin, 1998) and automatic named en-
tity recognition using the C&C tagger (Curran and
Clark, 2003) trained on the data from the MUC-7
shared task (Chinchor, 1998). Weights for the var-
ious IE-based representations are calculated over
each input document set.
5.2 Evaluation
The evaluation uses Rouge
9
to determine which
representation selects content that overlaps most
with human summaries. Rouge estimates the
coverage of appropriate concepts (Lin, 2004) in
a summary by comparing it to several human-
created reference summaries. Rouge-1 does so
by computing recall based on macro-averaged un-
igram overlap. Rouge-SU4 does so by calculating
skip-bigram overlap where bigrams are allowed to
8

duc/index.html
9
Rouge stands for recall-oriented understudy for gisting
evaluations. While current versions also compute precision
and f-score of system summaries, the evaluation here uses
recall alone, which is sufficient when the length of the sum-
maries being compared is the same. Rouge can be obtained
from http://haydn.isi.edu/ROUGE/.

coverage (Lin, 2004), which suggest that Rouge-
1 and Rouge-SU4 with stemming and removal
of stop words are good measures for evaluating
multi-document summarisation tasks, consistently
achieving Pearson’s correlation scores above 0.72
and as high as 0.9 for longer summaries. Paired
Wilcoxon signed ranks tests across document sets
are used to check for significant differences be-
tween systems. The paired Wilcoxon signed ranks
test is a non-parametric analogue of the paired t
test. The null hypothesis is that the two popula-
tions from which the scores are sampled are iden-
tical.
6 Results
Can extractive summarisation be improved us-
ing representations based on generic informa-
tion extraction? Table 2 contains results for
tf*idf (TF), event (EV) and relation (RL) repre-
sentations. Columns contain results for different
lengths of summary (50, 100, 200 and 400 words).
The best representation for each summary length
is in bold and representations that are statistically
distinguishable from the best (i.e., p ? 0.05) are
underlined. The results demonstrate unambigu-
ously that the event and relation representations
outperform the tf*idf representation, with strongly
significant p-values less than 0.001 for both Rouge
measures and all summary lengths. The event and
relation representations are indistinguishable for
both Rouge measures and all summary lengths.

Table 3: Comparison of Rouge scores for entity
pairs based on relations (ER) and events (EE).
How does entity pair identification for generic
relations compare to entity pair identification
for atomic events? Table 3 contains results for
the representations described in Section 4.4. Rows
correspond to entity pair identification for rela-
tions (ER) and events (EE).
10
Results suggest that
the entity pair model based on GRE data out-
performs the entity pair model based on atomic
events, at least for medium sized summaries of
100 and 200 words where ER is significantly better
than EE for both Rouge measures.
How do the event and relation representations
perform with respect to corresponding entity
pair representations? The scores for the entity
pair representations reported in Table 3 are statisti-
cally indistinguishable from those for correspond-
ing relation and event representations in Table 2
above. This appears to be a mixed result for both
the relation representation introduced here and
the Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou event represen-
tation. And, while GRE is shown to have a positive
effect on Rouge scores when compared to atomic
events, the same cannot be said of approaches
to characterising relation and event types. How-
ever, as the correlation analysis (Section 7.1 be-
low) demonstrates, RL and ER do not necessar-
ily perform well on the same document sets. This
suggests that they are actually complementary to
some degree, meaning that a combined system
based on both representations would outperform
RL and ER on their own.
10
In contrast to the results for the tf*idf, relation and event
representations which use the modified adaptive algorithm
described above, results for entity pair representations use a
simplified version of the EXTRACT function that picks the
text unit that has the highest score. This performed signifi-
cantly better than the modified adaptive algorithm (p ? 0.01)
for all summary lengths for ER and was indistinguishable for
EE. See Hachey (2009) for details.
7 Analysis and Comparison
7.1 Complementarity
Figure 4 contains results for a correlation analy-
sis comparing the various representations. This
also includes a comparison to the human upper
bound (HU), computed by leave-one-out cross val-
idation. Cells in the matrix contain the correla-
tions values measured across document set Rouge-
SU4 scores
11
using Spearman’s ? rank correlation
coefficient (r
S
). Here, high values mean that two
representations tend to perform well on the same
document sets such that an ordering of document
sets by Rouge scores is similar for the representa-
tions being compared. In the figure, correlation
strength is represented by shading where light-
toned squares indicate strong correlation (and the
darkest squares indicate weak negative correla-
tion). For example, the upper left cell contains r
S
between the TF and EV representations. The four
squares correspond to r
S
values of -0.085, 0.199,
0.245 and 0.267 respectively for summaries of 50,
100, 200 and 400 words.
The analysis illustrates a number of interest-
ing points. First, it demonstrates that none of
the representations correlate highly with the hu-
man upper bound, meaning that the automatic sys-
tems do not necessarily do well on the document
sets that may be considered easier as measured
by human agreement using Rouge. This suggests
that task difficulty does not need to be considered
as a possible underlying cause of correlation be-
tween the automatic systems. The analysis also
illustrates that there is no clear and consistent re-
lationship between summary length and correla-
tion values. Some cells suggest that correlation
may have a monotonic linear relationship increas-
ing with length (e.g., TF*EV) while others seem
to suggest inverse linear (e.g., TF*RL), quadratic
(e.g., EV*HU) and invariant (e.g., EV*EE) rela-
tionships with length.
Looking at correlation between automatic sys-
tems (i.e., TF, EV, RL, EE and ER), correla-
tion values closer to zero suggest that the sys-
tems do well on different document sets and that
a combined system might therefore be better.
By this reasoning, the largest gains would come
from combining TF with any other representation.
Among the other automatic systems, the relation

gests that ER should not necessarily be consid-

7.2 Error Analysis
Four document sets were considered for error
analysis. These were selected to cover different
relative rankings of representations. Rows in Ta-
ble 4 give the document set ID and list the repre-
sentations in order of their Rouge-SU4 scores. In-
spection of the corresponding document sets sug-
gests that the different approaches compared here
are appropriate for different types of summary
tasks. Specifically, it suggests that relation and
event representations perform poorly on summari-
sation tasks that are oriented towards sentiment,
description or analysis. However, they do well
on document sets that are oriented towards fac-
tual information typical of information extraction
tasks (though current representations do not cap-
ture date, time or numeric information). This sup-
ports the notion from the previous section that the
different representations evaluated here are com-
plementary.
The document set (d06) for the summaries in
Figure 5 illustrates a case where the relation and
event representations perform well with respect
Set Rank 1 Rank 2 Rank 3

to tf*idf. The gold standard summary describes
a beating event, addressing the basic facts of the
Rodney King beating by Los Angeles police as
well as the political aftermath which consists pri-
marily of an investigation and a summary of re-
lated police brutality events. The difference in
performance seems to be due to the fact that re-
lations and events are central to all aspects of
this summary and the relation and event represen-
tations clearly do better than tf*idf at capturing
this information. This summary also illustrates an
unintended side-effect of the relation representa-
tion where the generic relation identification algo-
rithm finds relations between components of lex-
ical compounds or multi-word phrases. The rep-
resentation for the third sentence in the RL sum-
mary, for example, includes a relation between
ORG police and XFN chief in addition to
true positive relations e.g. between ORG police
and PER darylgates and false positive re-
lations e.g. between PER tombradley and
ORG police.

from the community’. [S2] The images of Los Angeles police swinging nightsticks at King as he lay on
the ground, played repeatedly on national news programs, were burned into the national conscience and
led to widespread calls for investigation of police brutality. [S3] Besides recommending that Mr Gates

Mayor Tom Bradley and Police Chief Daryl Gates in the wake of the videotaped beating March 3 of a

The most important of the many cases of police brutality reported in southern California 1989-1992, was
the beating of Rodney King by four Los Angeles officers on March 3, 1991. An investigating commission
outlined steps for improvement of the police department and called for the resignation of Chief Gates.
Gates did not resign until the following year after the acquittal of the four officers caused massive rioting.
Other cases of police brutality arose in Minneapolis, Chicago and Kansas City. Operation Rescue claimed
that its non-violent anti-abortion demonstrators were seriously injured by excessive police tactics in more
than [END] 50 cities.

the DUC 2001 data. However, it uses supervised
machine learning (probabilistic support vector ma-
chines) to derive a salience function while we fo-
cus on unsupervised approaches that can be ported
to new domains and tasks without annotation or
training. Interestingly, Wong et al.’s results sug-
gest that adding events to a word-based feature
set increases the precision of supervised sentence
extraction but reduces the recall. By contrast,
the current results and analysis provide evidence
that word and generic IE-based representations are
complementary when using unsupervised salience
functions for sentence extraction.
The Wong et al. (2008) paper also provides use-
ful results for comparison to state-of-the art. On
the 200 word summarisation task, Wong et al. re-
port Rouge-1 scores of 0.352 and 0.344 respec-
tively for word-based and event-based represen-
tations. On the same task, our unsupervised ap-
proach achieves Rouge-1 scores of 0.174, 0.232,
0.229, 0.241 and 0.253 respectively for the tf*idf,
event, event entity pair, relation and relation en-
tity pair representations. Wong et al.’s best overall
score is 0.396 using a representation that combines
surface, content and relevance features.
8 Conclusion
Experiments were presented that compare the ef-
fect of various source document representations
on the accuracy of automatic summarisation. This
serves as an extrinsic evaluation of generic relation
extraction, a domain-neutral and fully portable ap-
proach to relation identification and characterisa-
tion. Results demonstrate that GRE is an effective
representation for sentence extraction for multi-
document summarisation. Performance for the re-
lation representation is significantly better than a
non-trivial tf*idf baseline across the range of sum-
mary lengths explored. Performance is also at
least as good as a comparable but less general rep-
resentation based on event extraction. Correlation
analysis suggests that different representations are
complementary due to the fact that they perform
well on different document sets. Error analysis
supports this conclusion, suggesting that the rela-
tion and event representations perform poorly on
summarisation tasks that are oriented towards e.g.
sentiment, description or analysis while they per-
form well on tasks that focus on fact-oriented in-
formation.
