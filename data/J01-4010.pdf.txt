This book stems from the Sixth Summer School on Language and Speech Commu- 
nication, held in Barcelona, Spain, in 1998, sponsored by ELSNET (The European 
Network of Excellence in Human Language Technologies) and the EU TMR (Training 
and Mobility of Researchers) program. The summer school, whose special theme was 
"Robustness: Real life applications in language and speech," is the third such summer 
school to give rise to a book in this Kluwer series, following on from edited collections 
by Young and Bloothooft (1997) and van Eynde and Gibbon (2000). 
One slightly odd feature of the book, however, is that only 3 of the 10 courses 
given at the summer school are represented by chapters in the book; the remaining 6
technical chapters are invited contributions from other researchers. The chapter titles 
and authors, with an indication of whether the chapter originated from one of the 
courses, are as follows:

Introduction: Junqua and van Noord 
Acoustic features and distance measure: de Veth, Cranen, and Boves 
Speaker compensation i  automatic speech recognition: Tapias (course: 
"Robust speech recognition") 
Robustness in statistical language modeling: Bellegarda 
Improving robustness by modeling spontaneous speech events: Heeman 
and Allen 
Regular approximation of context-free grammars: Mohri and Nederhof 
Weighted grammar tools: The GRM library: Mohri 
Robust parsing and beyond: Chanod (course: "Finite-state parsing") 
Robust parsing of word graphs: van Noord (course: "Robust efficient 
parsing for spoken dialogue processing") 
Balancing robustness and efficiency: Ros6 and Lavie 
All of the chapters are at an introductory level and should be accessible to a com- 
putational linguistics researcher who is not a specialist in the particular area. Even 
though the material on speech processing requires ome mathematical background

to understand fully, the main formulae are usually glossed and the text is illustrated 
where appropriate with graphs, histograms, and block diagrams o the less mathe- 
matical reader should come away with at least a broad understanding of the most 
important points. Although the book is targeted at the nonspecialist, there is a dif- 
ference in overall style between, roughly, the earlier chapters on speech and those on 
language processing. Thus, chapters 2--4 consist of surveys and empirical comparisons 
of a number of different techniques, whereas the succeeding chapters place more em- 
phasis on the authors' own work and less on comparing and contrasting competing 
approaches. 
The publisher's publicity suggests that the book contains material that could be 
used in graduate or undergraduate courses. Some of the chapters might be suitable, 
but the book would be too expensive for most students. For teaching purposes, it 
might be worth waiting to see if ELSNET starts to sell the book at a discounted price, 
as they have done with the previous two summer school books. 
The book contains very few typos and is in the main well written, except hat 
the English in one chapter is unidiomatic. The chapter by Tapias refers the reader to 
potentially useful ancillary material (proofs and MATLAB programs) on ELSNET Web 
pages, but I was unable to find them there. 
If this were the only recently published book that brought ogether robust language 
and speech processing in an accessible way, then I would have no hesitation i  recom- 
mending it as a convenient reference. However, the book faces stiff competition from 
excellent books by Rayner el al. (2000) and Wahlster (2000), both on speech-to-speech 
translation. Each of these books forms a more coherent and satisfying whole, since 
they describe a single complete application system, making it easier for the reader to 
picture how the various pieces of robust processing technology fit together. Moreover, 
these books are only two-thirds of the price of Junqua and van Noord's, and if I were 
to buy only one book in this area it would be one of them.
