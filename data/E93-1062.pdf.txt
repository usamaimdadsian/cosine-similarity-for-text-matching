The goal of the PANGLOSS projecd is to develop a sys- 
tem which will, from the very beginning, produce high- 
quality translations ofunconstrained text. This can only 
be attained currently by keeping the human in the trans- 
lation loop, in our case via a software module called the 
AUO~R.  The main measure of progress in the de- 
velopment of the Pangloss ystem will therefore be the 
gradual decrease in need for user assistance, as the level 
of automation i creases. 
The analyzer used in the first version of PANGLOSS, PAN- 
GLOSS MARK I, is a version of the ULTRA Spanish analyzer 
from NMSU \[Farwell 1990\], while generation is carried 
out by the PENMAN generator f om ISI \[Mann 1983\]. The 
Translator's Workstation (TWS) provides the user inter- 
face and the integration platform \[Nirenburg 1992\]. This 
paper focuses on this use of TWS as a substrate for PAN- 
GLOSS. 
PANOLOSS operates in the following mode: a) a fully- 
automated translation of each full sentence is attempted; 
if it fails, then b) a fully-automated translation of smaller 
chunks of text is attempted (in the first PANGLOSS con- 
figuration, PANGLOSS MARK I, these were noun phrases); 
c) the material that does not get covered by noun phrases 
is treated in "word-for-word" mode, whereby translation 
suggestions for each word (or phrase) are sought in the 
system's MT lexicons, amachine-readable dictionary, and 
a set of user glossaries; d) The resulting list of trans- 
lated noun phrases and translation suggestions for words 
and phrases is displayed in a special editor window of 
TWS, where the human user finalizes the translation. At 
stages a) and b) there is an option of the user being pre- 
sented by the system with disambiguation questions via 
the AUGMENTOR. We provide an intelligent environment, 
the CMAT (Constituent Machine-Aided Translation) edi- 
tor, for postediting. It allows the user to select, move, 
and delete words and phrases (constituents) quickly and 
easily, using dynamically-changing menus. 
As can be seen in Figure 1, each constituent in the target 
window is surrounded by "<<" and ">>" characters. If the 
user clicks with the mouse anywhere within a constituent 
(between the "<<" and ">>" symbols), a CMAT menu for 
that constituent appears. It contains the word or phrase 
in the source text if available, the functions Move and 
Delete, and alternative translations of the word or phrase 
from the source text if any. Using these popup menus, the 
user moves, replaces, or deletes a constituent with a single 
mouse action, rapidly turning the list of translated words

puling Research Laboratory of New Mexico State University 
(NMSU), and the Information Sciences Institute of the Univer- 
sity of Southern California (IS1).

Figure 1: A typical CMAT menu 
and phrases into a coherent, high:quality arget language 
text. The user is not forced to use the CMAT editor at any 
particular time. Its use can be intermingled with other 
translation activities, according to the user's preferences. 
While the above environment is useful as a substrata 
for a gradual shift to ever more automatic systems, it is 
also useful as a practical translator's tool. Many minor 
improvements of the tool itself are planned that should 
together result in a significant increase in the human trans- 
lator's comfort and efficiency.
