Abstract
Concept taxonomies offer a powerful means 
for organizing knowledge, but this organiza-
tion  must  allow  for  many  overlapping  and 
fine-grained perspectives if a general-purpose 
taxonomy is  to  reflect  concepts  as  they are 
actually employed and reasoned about in ev-
eryday  usage.  We present  here  a  means  of 
bootstrapping  finely-discriminating  tax-
onomies from a variety of different  starting 
points, or seeds, that are acquired from three 
different sources: WordNet, ConceptNet and 
the web at large.  
1 Introduction
Taxonomies  provide  a  natural  and  intuitive 
means of organizing information, from the bio-
logical taxonomies of the Linnaean system to the 
layout of supermarkets and bookstores to the or-
ganizational structure of companies. Taxonomies 
also provide the structural backbone for ontolo-
gies  in  computer  science,  from common-sense 
ontologies like Cyc (Lenat and Guha, 1990) and 
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) to lexical ontolo-
gies like WordNet (Miller  et al., 1990). Each of 
these uses is based on the same root-branch-leaf 
metaphor:  the  broadest  terms  with  the  widest 
scope occupy the highest positions of a taxono-
my, near the root, while specific terms with the 
most local concerns are located lower in the hier-
archy,  nearest  the  leaves.  The  more  interior 
nodes that  a taxonomy possesses,  the finer  the 
conceptual distinctions and the more gradated the 
similarity judgments it can make (e.g., Budanit-
sky and Hirst, 2006).
General-purpose  computational  taxonomies 
are called upon to perform both coarse-grained 
and  fine-grained  judgments.  In  NLP,  for  in-
stance,  the  semantics  of  “eat”  requires  just 
enough  knowledge  to  discriminate  foods  like 
tofu and cheese from non-foods like  wool  and 
steel, while specific applications in the domain of 
cooking  and  recipes  (e.g.,  Hammond’s  (1986) 
CHEF)  require  enough  discrimination  to  know 
that tofu can be replaced with clotted cheese in 
many recipes because each is a soft, white and 
bland food.  
So while much depends on the domain of us-
age, it remains an open question as to how many 
nodes a good taxonomy should possess. Prince-
ton WordNet,  for  instance,  strives for  as many 
nodes as there are word senses in English, yet it 
also contains a substantial number of composite 
nodes  that  are  lexicalized not  as  single  words, 
but as complex phrases. Print dictionaries intend-
ed for human consumption aim for some econo-
my of structure, and typically do not include the 
meaning  of  phrases  that  can  be  understood  as 
straightforward compositions of the meaning of 
their  parts  (Hanks,  2004).  But  WordNet  also 
serves another purpose, as a lexical knowledge-
base  for  computers,  not  humans,  a  context  in 
which concerns about space seem quaint. When 
space is not a issue, there seems no good reason 
to exclude nodes from a concept taxonomy mere-
ly for being composites of other ideas; the real 
test of entry is whether a given node adds value 
to a taxonomy, by increasing its level of internal 
organization through the systematic dissection of 
overly broad categories into finer, more intuitive 
and manageable clusters.
In this paper we describe a means by which 
finely-discriminating  taxonomies  can  be  grown 
from  a  variety  of  different  knowledge  seeds. 
These taxonomies comprise composite categories 
that  can  be  lexicalized  as  phrases  of  the  form 
“ADJ NOUN”, such as Sharp-Instrument, which 
represents the set of all instruments that are typi-
cally considered sharp, such as knives, scissors, 
chisels and can-openers. While WordNet already 
contains  an  equivalent  category,  named  Edge-
835
Tool, which it defines with the gloss “any cutting 
tool  with a sharp cutting edge”,  it  provides  no 
structural basis for inferring that any member of 
this  category can be considered  sharp.  For  the 
most part, if two ideas (word senses) belong to 
the same semantic category X in WordNet, the 
most we can infer is that both possess the trivial 
property  X-ness.  Our  goal  here  is  to  construct 
taxonomies whose form makes explicit the actual 
properties that accrue from membership in a cat-
egory. 
Past work on related approaches to taxonomy 
creation are discussed in section 2, while section 
3  describes  the  different  knowledge  seeds  that 
serve as the starting point for our bootstrapping 
process. In section 4 we describe the bootstrap-
ping process in more detail;  such processes are 
prone to noise, so we also discuss how the ac-
quired categorizations are validated and filtered 
after each bootstrapping cycle. An evaluation of 
the key ideas is then presented in section 5, to 
determine which seed yields the highest quality 
taxonomy once bootstrapping is completed. The 
paper then concludes with some final remarks in 
section 6.
2 Related Work
Simple pattern-matching techniques can be sur-
prisingly effective for the extraction of lexico-se-
mantic relations from text when those relations 
are expressed using relatively stable and unam-
biguous  syntagmatic  patterns  (Ahlswede  and 
Evens, 1988). For instance, the work of Hearst 
(1992) typifies this surgical approach to relation 
extraction,  in  which a system fishes in  a large 
text for particular word sequences that strongly 
suggest  a  semantic  relationship  such  as  hyper-
nymy  or,  in  the  case  of  Charniak and Berland 
(1999), the part-whole relation. Such efforts offer 
high precision but can exhibit low recall on mod-
erate-sized corpora, and extract just a tiny (but 
very useful) subset of the semantic content of a 
text.  The  KnowItAll system  of  Etzioni  et  al. 
(2004)  employs  the  same  generic  patterns  as 
Hearst (e.g., “NPs such as NP1, NP2, …”),  and 
more besides, to extract a whole range of facts 
that can be exploited for web-based question-an-
swering.  Cimiano  and  Wenderoth  (2007)  also 
use a range of Hearst-like patterns to find text se-
quences in web-text that are indicative of the lex-
ico-semantic  properties  of  words;  in  particular, 
these  authors  use  phrases  like  “to  *  a  new 
NOUN” and “the purpose of NOUN is to *” to 
identify the formal (isa), agentive (made by) and 
telic (used for) roles of nouns.
Snow, Jurafsky and Ng (2004) use supervised 
learning techniques to acquire those syntagmatic 
patterns that prove most useful for extracting hy-
pernym relations from text. They train their sys-
tem using pairs of WordNet terms that exemplify 
the hypernym relation; these are used to identify 
specific sentences in corpora that are most likely 
to express the relation in lexical terms. A binary 
classifier is then trained on lexico-syntactic fea-
tures that are extracted from a dependency-struc-
ture  parse  of  these  sentences.  Kashyap  et  al., 
(2005) experiment with a bootstrapping approach 
to  growing concept  taxonomies  in  the  medical 
domain.  A  gold  standard  taxonomy  provides 
terms that are used to retrieve documents which 
are  then  hierarchically  clustered;  cohesiveness 
measures are used to yield a taxonomy of terms 
that can then further drive the retrieval and clus-
tering cycle. Kozareva  et al. (2008) use a boot-
strapping approach that extends the fixed-pattern 
approach  of  Hearst  (1992)  in  two  intriguing 
ways. First, they use a doubly-anchored retrieval 
pattern of the form “NOUNcat such as NOUNexam-
ple and  *”  to  ground the  retrieval  relative  to  a 
known example of hypernymy,  so that any val-
ues extracted for the wildcard * are likely to be 
coordinate terms of  NOUNexample and even more 
likely to be good examples of NOUNcat. Second-
ly, they construct a graph of terms that co-occur 
within this pattern to determine which terms are 
supported by others,  and by how much.  These 
authors also use two kinds of bootstrapping: the 
first  variation,  dubbed  reckless,  uses the candi-
dates extracted from the double-anchored pattern 
(via *) as exemplars (NOUNexample) for successive 
retrieval cycles; the second variation first checks 
whether a candidate is sufficiently supported to 
be used as an exemplar in future retrieval cycles.
The approach we describe here is most similar 
to that of Kozareva  et al. (2008). We too use a 
double-anchored pattern, but place the anchors in 
different  places  to  obtain  the  query  patterns 
“ADJcat NOUNcat such as *” and “ADJcat * such 
as NOUNexample”. As a result, we obtain a finely-
discriminating  taxonomy  based  on  categories 
that are explicitly annotated with the properties 
(ADJcat)  that  they  bequeath  to  their  members. 
These categories have an obvious descriptive and 
organizational  utility,  but  of  a kind that  one is 
unlikely  to  find  in  conventional  resources  like 
WordNet and Wikipedia. Kozareva et al. (2008) 
test their approach on relatively simple and ob-
jective  categories  like  states,  countries (both 
836
closed sets), singers and fish (both open, the for-
mer more so than the latter), but not on complex 
categories in which members are tied both to a 
general category, like food, and to a stereotypical 
property, like  sweet (Veale and Hao, 2007). By 
validating  membership  in  these  complex  cate-
gories  using WordNet-based heuristics,  we  can 
hang these categories and members  on specific 
WordNet senses, and thus enrich WordNet with 
this additional taxonomic structure.
3 Seeds for Taxonomic Growth 
A fine-grained taxonomy can be viewed as a set 
of triples Tijk = <Ci, Dj, Pk>, where Ci denotes a child of the parent term Pk that possesses the dis-
criminating  property  Dj;  in  effect,  each  such 
triple expresses that Ci is a specialization of the 
complex  taxonym  Dj-Pk.  Thus,  the  belief  that 
cola  is  a  carbonated-drink  is  expressed  by the 
triple <cola, carbonated, drink>. From this triple 
we  can  identify  other  categorizations  of  cola 
(such as treat and refreshment) via the web query 
“carbonated * such as cola”, or we can identify 
other similarly fizzy drinks via the query “car-
bonated  drinks  such  as  *”.  So  this  web-based 
bootstrapping  of  fine-grained  category  hierar-
chies requires that we already possess a collec-
tion  of  fine-grained  distinctions  of  a  relatively 
high-quality.  We  now  consider  three  different 
starting points for this bootstrapping process, as 
extracted from three different resources:  Word-
Net, ConceptNet and the web at large.
3.1 WordNet 
The noun-sense taxonomy of WordNet makes a 
number  of  fine-grained  distinctions  that  prove 
useful in clustering entities into smaller and more 
natural groupings. For instance, WordNet differ-
entiates  {feline,  felid} into  the  sub-categories 
{true_cat,  cat} and  {big_cat,  cat},  the  former 
serving  to  group  domesticated  cats  with  other 
cats of a similar size, the latter serving to cluster 
cats  that  are  larger,  wilder  and  more  exotic. 
However, such fine-grained distinctions are the 
exception rather than the norm in WordNet, and 
not  one of  the  60+ words  of  the  form  Xess in 
WordNet that denote a person (such as huntress,  
waitress, Jewess, etc.) express the defining prop-
erty  female in  explicit  taxonomic  terms. 
Nonetheless, the free-text glosses associated with 
WordNet sense-entries often do state the kind of 
distinctions we would wish to find expressed as 
explicit  taxonyms.  A  shallow  parse  of  these 
glosses  thus  yields  a  sizable  number  of  fine-
grained  distinctions,  such  as  <lioness,  female,  
lion>,   <espresso,  strong,  coffee>  and  both 
<messiah, awaited, king> and <messiah, expect-
ed, deliverer>. 
3.2 ConceptNet 
Despite  its  taxonomic  organization,  WordNet 
owes much to the centralized and authority-pre-
serving  craft  of  traditional  lexicography.  Con-
ceptNet (Liu and Singh, 2004), in contrast, is a 
far less authoritative knowledge-source, one that 
owes more to the workings of the WWW than to 
conventional print dictionaries. Comprising fac-
toids culled from the template-structured contri-
butions of thousands of web users,  ConceptNet 
expresses many relationships that accurately re-
flect  a  public,  common-sense  view on a  given 
topic (from vampires to dentists) and many more 
that are simply bizarre or ill-formed. Looking to 
the relation that interests us here, the IsA rela-
tion,  ConceptNet  tells  us  that  an  espresso is  a 
strong coffee (correctly, like WordNet) but that a 
bagel is a Jewish word (confusing use with men-
tion). Likewise, we find that expressionism is an 
artistic style (correct, though WordNet deems it 
an  artistic movement) but that an  explosion is a 
suicide attack (confusing formal and telic roles). 
Since we cannot trust the content of ConceptNet 
directly, lest we bootstrap from a highly unreli-
able starting point, we use WordNet as a simple 
filter.  While  the  concise  form  of  ConceptNet 
contains over 30,000 IsA propositions, we con-
sider as our seed collection only those that define 
a noun concept (such as “espresso”) in terms of a 
binary  compound  (e.g.,  “strong coffee”)  where 
the head of the latter (e.g.,  “coffee”) denotes a 
WordNet hypernym of some sense of the former. 
This  yields  triples  such  as  <Wyoming,  great,  
state>,  <wreck,  serious,  accident>  and  <wolf,  
wild, animal>.
3.3 Web-derived Stereotypes 
Veale and Hao (2007) also use the observations 
of web-users to acquire common perceptions of 
oft-mentioned ideas, but do so by harvesting sim-
ile expressions of the form “as ADJ as a NOUN” 
directly from the web.  Their approach hinges on 
the fact that similes exploit stereotypes to draw 
out the salient properties of a target, thereby al-
lowing rich  descriptions of those stereotypes to 
be easily acquired, e.g., that snowflakes are pure 
and unique, acrobats are agile and nimble, knifes 
are  sharp and dangerous,  viruses  are  malicious 
and infectious, and so on. However, because they 
find that almost 15% of their web-harvested sim-
837
iles are ironic (e.g., “as subtle as a rock”, “as bul-
letproof as a sponge-cake”, etc.), they filter irony 
from these associations by hand, to yield a siz-
able  database  of  stereotypical  attributions  that 
describes over 6000 noun concepts in terms of 
over  2000  adjectival  properties.  However,  be-
cause Veale and Hao’s data directly maps stereo-
typical properties to simile vehicles, it does not 
provide  a  parent  category  for  these  vehicles. 
Thus, the seed triples derived from this data are 
only partially instantiated;  for  instance,  we ob-
tain <surgeon, skilful, ?>, <virus, malicious, ?> 
and <dog, loyal, ?>.  This does not prove to be a 
serious  impediment,  however,  as  the  missing 
field  of  each triple  is  quickly identified during 
the first cycle of bootstrapping.
3.4 Overview of Seed Resources 
Neither of these three seeds is an entirely useful 
knowledge-base in its own right. The WordNet-
based seed is clearly a representation of conve-
nience,  since  it  contains  only  those  properties 
that can be acquired from the glosses that happen 
to be amenable  to a simple  shallow-parse.  The 
ConceptNet seed is likewise a small collection of 
low-hanging fruit, made smaller still by the use 
of WordNet as a coarse but very necessary noise-
filter.  And while the simile-derived distinctions 
obtained from Veale and Hao paint a richly de-
tailed  picture  of  the  most  frequent  objects  of 
comparison, this seed offers no coverage for the 
majority of concepts that are insufficiently note-
worthy to be found in web similes. A quantita-
tive comparison of all three seeds is provided in 
Table 1 below.

tures 2305 550 1172
Table 1:  The size of seed collections yielded from 
different sources. 
We can see that WordNet-derived seed is clearly 
the largest and apparently the most comprehen-
sive knowledge-source of the  three:  it  contains 
the most terms (concepts), the most features (dis-
criminating properties of those concepts), and the 
most triples (which situate those concepts in par-
ent  categories  that  are  further  specialized  by 
these  discriminating  features).  But  size  is  only 
weakly suggestive of quality, and as we shall see 
in  the  next  section,  even such  dramatic  differ-
ences in scale can disappear after several cycles 
of bootstrapping. In section 5 we will then con-
sider  which  of  these  seeds  yields  the  highest 
quality taxonomies after bootstrapping has been 
applied. 
4 Bootstrapping from Seeds
The seeds of the previous section each represent 
a different starting collection of triples. It is the 
goal of the bootstrapping process to grow these 
collections  of  triples,  to  capture  more  of  the 
terms – and more of the distinctions – that a tax-
onomy is expected to know about. The expansion 
set  of  a  triple  Tijk =  <Ci,  Dj,  Pk> is  the  set  of 
triples that can be acquired from the web using 
the  following  query  expansions  (*  is  a  search 
wildcard):
1. “Dj * such as Ci”
2. “Dj Pk such as *”
In the first query, a noun is sought to yield anoth-
er categorization of Ci, while in the second, other 
members of the fine-grained category Dj-Pk are 
sought to accompany Ci. In parsing the text snip-
pets  returned by these  queries,  we also exploit 
text sequences that match the following patterns:
3. “* and Dj Pk such as *”
4. “* and Dj * such as Ci”
These last two patterns allow us to learn new dis-
criminating  features  by  noting  how  these  dis-
criminators are combined to reinforce each other 
in  some  ad-hoc  category  formulations.  For  in-
stance, the phrase “cold and refreshing beverages 
such  as  lemonade”  allows  us  to  acquire  the 
triples <lemonade, cold, beverage> and <lemon-
ade, refreshing, beverage>. This pattern is neces-
sary if the bootstrapping process is to expand be-
yond  the  limited  vocabulary  of  discriminating 
features  (Dj)  found in  the  original  seed collec-
tions of triples.
We denote the mapping from a triple T to the 
set of additional triples that can be acquired from 
the web using the above queries/patterns as  ex-
pand(T').  We currently implement this function 
using  the  Google  search  API.  Our  experiences 
with each query suggest  that  200 snippets is  a 
good search range for the first query, while 50 is 
usually more than adequate for the second. 
838
We can now denote the knowledge that is ac-
quired when starting from a given seed collection 
S after t cycles of bootstrapping as KtS. Thus, 
K 0S=S
K 1S=K 0S ?
{T ? T '?S ? T?expand ?T ' ?}
K t?1S =K tS ?
{T ? T '?K tS ? T?expand ?T ' ?}
Web queries, and the small snippets of text that 
they return, offer just a keyhole view of language 
as it is used in real documents.  Unsurprisingly, 
the  new triples  acquired from the  web via  ex-
pand(T') are likely to be very noisy indeed. Fol-
lowing Kozareva et al. (2008), we can either in-
dulge  in  reckless  bootstrapping,  which  ignores 
the  question  of  noise  until  all  bootstrapping  is 
finished, or we can apply a noise filter after each 
incremental step.  The latter approach has the ad-
ditional advantage of keeping the search-space as 
small as possible, which is a major consideration 
when bootstrapping from sizable seeds. We use a 
simple WordNet-based filter called near-miss:  a 
new triple <Ci,  Dj,  Pk> is accepted if WordNet 
contains  a  sense  of  Ci that  is  a  descendant  of 
some sense of Pk (a hit), or a sense of Ci that is a 
descendant of the direct hypernym of some sense 
of Pk (a near-miss). This allows the bootstrapping 
process to acquire structures that are not simply a 
decorated version of the basic WordNet taxono-
my,  but  to acquire hierarchical  relations whose 
undifferentiated forms are not in WordNet (yet 
are largely compatible with WordNet). This non-
reckless bootstrapping process can be expressed 
as follows:
K t?1S =K tS ? {T ? T '?K tS ?
T? filter near?miss?expand ?T ' ??}
Figure 1 and figure 2 below illustrate the rate of 
growth  of  triple-sets  from  each  of  our  three 
seeds.
Referring again to table 1, we note that while 
the ConceptNet collection is by far the smallest 
of  the three seeds – more  that  7 times smaller 
than the simile-derived seed, and almost 40 times 
smaller than the WordNet seed – this difference 
is  size  shrinks  considerably over  the  course  of 
five  bootstrapping  cycles.  The  WordNet  near-
miss filter ensures that the large body of triples 
grown from each  seed  are  broadly  sound,  and 
that  we  are  not  simply  generating  comparable 
quantities of nonsense in each case.
Figure 1: Growth in the number of acquired triples, 
over 5 cycles of bootstrapping from different seeds.
Figure 2: Growth in the number of terms described by 
the acquired triples, over 5 cycles of bootstrapping 
from different seeds.
4.1 An  Example
Consider cola, for which the simile seed has one 
triple: <cola, refreshing, beverage>. After a sin-
gle cycle of bootstrapping, we find that cola can 
now be described as an effervescent beverage, a 
sweet  beverage,  a  nonalcoholic  beverage and 
more. After a second cycle, we find it described 
as a sugary food, a fizzy drink and a dark mixer. 
After a third cycle, it is found to be a  sensitive 
beverage, an  everyday beverage and a  common 
drink. After a fourth cycle, it is also found to be 
an  irritating food and an  unhealthy drink. After 
the  fifth  cycle,  it  is  found to  be  a  stimulating 
drink, a toxic food and a corrosive substance. In 
all, the single cola triple in the simile seed yields 
14 triples after 1 cycle, 43 triples after 2 cycles, 
72 after 3 cycles, 93 after 4 cycles, and 102 after 
5 cycles. During these bootstrapping cycles, the 
description  refreshing beverage additionally be-
comes  associated  with  the  terms  champagne, 
lemonade and beer.

5 Empirical Evaluation
The WordNet  near-miss filter thus ensures that 
the parent field (Pk) of every triple contains a val-
ue  that  is  sensible  for  the  given  child  concept 
(Ci), but does not ensure that the discriminating 
property  (Dj)  in  each  triple  is  equally  sensible 
and apropos.  To see  whether the bootstrapping 
process  is  simply  padding  the  seed  taxonomy 
with large quantities of noise,  or whether the ac-
quired Dj values do indeed mark out the implicit 
essence of the Ci terms they describe, we need an 
evaluation framework that can quantify the onto-
logical usefulness of these Dj values. For this, we 
use  the  experimental  setup  of  Almuhareb  and 
Poesio  (2005),  who  use  information  extraction 
from the web to acquire attribute values for dif-
ferent terms/concepts, and who then compare the 
taxonomy that can be induced by clustering these 
values  with the  taxonomic  backbone  of  Word-
Net. 
Almuhareb and Poesio first created a balanced 
set  of  402  nouns  from  21  different  semantic 
classes in WordNet. They then acquired attested 
attribute values for these nouns (such as  hot for 
coffee,  red for car, etc.) using the query "(a|an|
the) * Ci  (is|was)" to find corresponding Dj val-
ues for each Ci. Unlike our work, these authors 
did  not seek to acquire hypernyms  for each Ci 
during this search, and did not try to link the ac-
quired attribute values to a particular branching 
point  (Pk) in the taxonomy (they did,  however, 
seek matching attributes for these values, such as 
Temperature for  hot, but that aspect is not rele-
vant here). They acquired 94,989 attribute values 
in all for the 402 test nouns. These values were 
then used as features of the corresponding nouns 
in  a  clustering  experiment,  using  the  CLUTO 
system of Karypis (2002). By using attribute val-
ues  as  a  basis  for  partitioning  the  set  of  402 
nouns  into  21  different  categories,  Almuhareb 
and Poesio attempted to reconstruct the original 
21  WordNet  categories  from which  the  nouns 
were drawn. The more accurate the match to the 
original WordNet clustering, the more these at-
tribute values can be seen (and used) as a repre-
sentation of conceptual structure. In their first at-
tempt, they achieved just a 56.7% clustering ac-
curacy against the original human-assigned cate-
gories of WordNet. But after using a noise-filter 
to remove almost  half of the web-harvested at-
tribute values, they achieve a higher cluster accu-
racy of 62.7%. More specifically, Poesio and Al-
muhareb achieve a cluster purity of 0.627 and a 
cluster entropy of 0.338 using 51,345 features to 
describe and cluster the 402 nouns.1
We replicate the above experiments using the 
same 402 nouns, and assess the clustering accur­
acy   (again  using  WordNet   as   a   gold­standard) 
after each bootstrapping cycle. Recall that we use 
only the Dj fields of each triple as features for the 
clustering  process,   so   the  comparison  with   the 
WordNet gold­standard is still a fair one. Once 
again, the goal is to determine how much like the 
human­crafted   WordNet   taxonomy   is   the   tax­
onomy  that   is  clustered automatically  from the 
discriminating words Dj only. The clustering ac­
curacy for all three seeds are shown in Tables 2, 
3 and 4.

Table 4: Clustering accuracy using the Simile seed

The test-set of 402 nouns contains some low-fre-
quency words, such as casuarina,  cinchona,  do-
decahedron, and  concavity, and Almuhareb and 
1 We use cluster purity as a reflection of clustering accu-
racy. We express accuracy as a percentage; hence a pu-
rity of 0.627 is seen as an accuracy of 62.7%.

Poesio note that one third of their data-set has a 
low-frequency of between 5-100 occurrences in 
the British National Corpus. Looking to the cov-
erage  column  of  each  table,  we  thus  see  that 
there  are  words  in  the  Poesio  and  Almuhareb 
data set for which no triples can be acquired in 5 
cycles  of  bootstrapping.  Interestingly,  though 
each seed is quite different in origin and size (see 
again Table 1), all reach similar levels of cover-
age (~82%) after  5 bootstrapping cycles.   Test 
nouns for which all three seeds fail to reach a de-
scription  include  yesteryear,  nonce (very rare), 
salient (more typically an adjective), jag, droop,  
fluting,  fete,  throb,  poundage,  stinging,  rouble,  
rupee,  riel,  drachma,  escudo,  dinar,  dirham,  
lira, dispensation,  hoard,  airstream (not typical-
ly a solid compound), riverside and curling. Fig-
ures 3 and 4 summarize the key findings in the 
above tables: while bootstrapping from all three 
seeds converges to the same level of coverage, 
the simile seed clearly produces the highest qual-
ity taxonomy. 
Figure 3: Growth in the coverage from different 
seed sources. 
Figure 4: Divergence in the clustering Purity 
achieved using different seed sources. The results of 
Poesio and Almuhareb are shown as the straight line: 
y = 0.627.
Both  the  WordNet  and  ConceptNet  seeds 
achieve comparable accuracies of 68% and 67% 
respectively  after  5  cycles  of  bootstrapping, 
which compares well with the accuracy of 62.7% 
achieved  by  Poesio  and  Almuhareb.  However, 
the simile seed clearly yields the best accuracy of 
84.3%,  which  also  exceeds  the  accuracy  of 
66.4% achieved by Poesio and Almuhareb when 
using both values  and attributes (such as  Tem-
perature, Color, etc.) for clustering, or the accu-
racy of 70.9% they achieve when using attributes 
alone. Furthermore, bootstrapping from the simi-
le seed yields higher cluster accuracy on the 402-
noun data-set than Veale and Hao (2008) them-
selves achieve with their simile data on the same 
test-set (69.85%). 
But most striking of all is the concision of the 
representations that are acquired using bootstrap-
ping. The simile seed yields a high cluster accu-
racy using a pool of just 2,614 fine discrimina-
tors,  while  Poesio  and  Almuhareb  use  51,345 
features even after their feature-set has been fil-
tered  for  noise.  Though starting  from different 
initial scales, each seed converges toward a fea-
ture-set that is roughly twenty times smaller than 
that used by Poesio and Almuhareb. 
6 Conclusions
These experiments reveal that seed knowledge of 
different authoritativeness, quality and size will 
tend to converge toward roughly the same num-
ber  of  finely  discriminating  properties  and  to-
ward much the same coverage after 5 or so cy-
cles of bootstrapping. Nonetheless, quality wins 
out,  and  the  simile-derived  seed  knowledge 
shows itself to be a clearly superior basis for rea-
soning  about  the  structure  and  organization  of 
conceptual  categories.  Bootstrapping  from  the 
simile  seed yields  a slightly smaller  set of  dis-
criminating features than bootstrapping from the 
WordNet  seed,  one that  is  many times  smaller 
than the Poesio and Almuhareb feature set. What 
matters is that they are the right features to dis-
criminate with. 
There appears to be a number of reasons for 
this  significant  difference  in  quality.  For  one, 
Veale and Hao (2007) show that similes express 
highly  stereotypical  beliefs  that  strongly  influ-
ence the affective disposition of a term/concept; 
negatively  perceived  concepts  are  commonly 
used to exemplify negative properties in similes, 
while  positively perceived  concepts  are  widely 
used to exemplify positive properties. Veale and 
Hao (2008) go on to argue that similes offer a 
very concise snapshot of those widely-held be-
liefs that are the cornerstone of everyday reason-

ing, and which should thus be the corner-stone of 
any general-purpose taxonomy.  In addition, be-
liefs expressed via the “as Dj as Ci” form of simi-
les  appear  to  lend  themselves  to  re-expression 
via the “Dj Pk such as  Ci” form; in each case, a 
concept Ci is held up as an exemplar of a salient 
property  Dj.  Since  the  “such  as”  bootstrapping 
pattern seeks out  expressions of  prototypicality 
on the web, a simile-derived seed set is likely the 
best starting point for this search.
All three seeds appear to suffer the same cov-
erage limitations,  topping out  at  about  82% of 
the words in the Poesio and Almuhareb data-set. 
Indeed,  after  5  bootstrapping  cycles,  all  three 
seeds give rise to taxonomies that overlap on 328 
words from the 402-noun test-set, accounting for 
81.59% of the test-set. In effect then, bootstrap-
ping stumbles over the same core of hard words 
in each case, no matter the seed that is used. As 
such, the problem of coverage lies not in the seed 
collection, but in the queries used to perform the 
bootstrapping.  The  same  coverage  limitations 
will thus apply to other bootstrapping approaches 
to  knowledge acquisition,  such as  Kozareva  et  
al. (2008), which rely on much the same stock 
patterns.  So  while  bootstrapping may not  be  a 
general  solution  for  acquiring  all  aspects  of  a 
general-purpose taxonomy, it is clearly useful in 
acquiring large swathes  of  such a  taxonomy if 
given  a  sufficiently  high-quality  seed  to  start 
from.
