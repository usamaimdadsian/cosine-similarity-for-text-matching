Abstract 
Is it possible to specify a grammatical 
representation (descriptors and their ap- 
plication guidelines) to such a degree 
that it can be consistently applied by 
different grammarians e.g. for producing 
a benchmark corpus for p.arser evalua- 
tion? Arguments for and against have 
been given, but very little empirical ev- 
idence. In this article we report on a 
double-blind experiment with a surface- 
oriented morphosyntactic grammatical 
representation used in a large-scale En- 
glish parser. We argue that a consis- 
tently applicable representation for mor- 
phology and also shallow syntax can be 
specified. A grammatical representation 
with a near-100% coverage of running 
text can be specified with a reasonable 
effort, especially if the representation is 
based on structural distinctions (i.e. it is 
structurally resolvable). 
1 Introduction 
The central task of a parser is to assign gram- 
matical descriptions onto input sentences. Eval- 
uating a parser's output (as well as designing a 
computational lexicon and grammar) presupposes 
a predefined, parser-independent specification of 
the grammatical representation. 
Perhaps surprisingly, the possibility of specify- 
ing a workable grammatical representation is a 
matter of controversy, even at lower levels of anal- 
ysis, e.g. morphology (incl. parts of speech). 
Consider the following setting (the double-blind 
experiment). Two linguists trained to apply a tag 
set to running text according to application guide- 
lines (a "style sheet") are to analyse a given data 
individually. The results are then automatically 
compared, and the differences are jointly exam- 
ined by these linguists to see whether the differ- 
ences are due to inattention, or whether they are 
intentional (i.e. there is a genuine difference in 
analysis). - How many percentage points of all 
words in running text are retain a different anal- 
ysis after the differences due to inattention have 
been omitted? The higher this percentage, the 
more susceptible seems the possibility of specify- 
ing a workable grammatical representation. 
According to a pessimistic view (e.g. Church 
1992), the part of speech of several percentage 
points of words in running text is impossible to 
agree on by different judges, even after negotia- 
tions. A more optimistic view can be found in 
(Leech and Eyes 1993, p. 39; Marcus et al. 1993, 
p. 328); they argue that a near-100% interjudge 
agreement is possible, provided the part-of-speech 
annotation is done carefully by experts. Unfortu- 
nately, they give very little empirical evidence for 
their position e.g. in terms of double-blind exper- 
iments. 
Supposing defining these lower levels of gram- 
matical representation is so problematic, the more 
distinctive levels should be even more difficult. If 
specifying the task of the parser - what the parser 
is supposed to do - turns out to be so problematic, 
one could even question the rationality of natu- 
ral language parser design as a whole. In other 
words, the controversy regarding the specifiability 
of a grammatical representation is a fundamental 
issue. 
In this article we report on a double-blind ex- 
periment with a surface-oriented morphosyntactic 
grammatical representation used by a large-scale 
English parser. We show that defining a gram- 
matical representation is possible, even relatively 
straightforward. We present results from part-of- 
speech annotation and shallow syntactic analysis. 
Our three main findings are: 
1. A practically 100% interjudge agreement can 
be reached at the level of morphological (incl. 
part-of-speech) analysis provided that (i) the 
grammatical representation is based on struc- 
tural distinctions and (ii) the individual de- 
scriptive practices of the most frequent 'prob- 
lem cases' are properly documented. 
2. A shallow dependency-oriented functional 
syntax can be defined, very much like a mor- 
phological representation. The only substan- 
210 
tial difference seems to be that somewhat 
more effort for documenting the individual 
solution is needed at the level of syntax. 
3. A grammatical representation (morphosyn- 
tactic descriptors and their application guide- 
lines) can be specified with a reasonable f- 
fort. In addition to general descriptive prin- 
ciples, only a few dozen construction-specific 
entries seem necessary for reaching a high 
coverage of running text. 
In short: In this paper we give empirical evi- 
dence for the possibility of specifying a grammati- 
cal representation in enough detail to make it (al- 
most) consistently applicable. What we are less 
specific about here is the exact formal properties 
that make a representation easy to specify; this 
topic remains open for future investigation. 
2 Grammatical representation i  
English Constraint Grammar 
In the experiment to be reported in Section 3, we 
employed the grammatical representation that de- 
fines the descriptive task of the English Constraint 
Grammar Parser ENGCG (Karlsson et al. (eds.) 
1995). 1
2.1 Morpho logy  
The morpholexical component in ENGCG em- 
ploys 139 morphological tags for part of speech, 
inflection, derivation and certain syntactic prop- 
erties (e.g. verb classification). Each morpholog- 
ical analysis usually consists of several tags, and 
many words get several analyses as alternatives. 
The following analysis of the sentence That round 
table might collapse is a rather extreme xample: 
"<*that>" 
"that" 
"that" 
"that" 
"that" 
"that" 
"<round>" 
"round"

The morphological analyser produces about 
180 different ag combinations. To compare the 
ENGCG morphological description with another 
well-known tag set, the Brown Corpus tag set: 
ENGCG is more distinctive in that the part of 
speech distinction is spelled out in the description 
of determiner-pronoun, preposition-conjunction, 
and determiner-adverb-pronoun homographs, as 
well as uninflected verb forms, which are repre- 
sented as ambiguous due to the subjunctive, im- 
perative, infinitive and present ense readings. On 
the other hand, ENGCG does not spell out part- 
of-speech ambiguity in the description of -ing and 
nonfinite -ed forms, noun-adjective homographs 
when the core meanings of the adjective and noun 
readings are similar, nor abbreviations vs. proper 
vs. common nouns. Generally, the ENGCG mor- 
phological tag set avoids the introduction of struc- 
turally unjustified istinctions. 
2.2 Syntax  
ENGCG syntax employs 30 dependency-oriented 
functional tags that indicate the surface-syntactic 
roles of nominal heads (subject, object, preposi- 
tion complement, apposition, etc.) and modifiers 
(premodifiers, postmodifiers). The shallow struc- 
ture of verb chains is also given - the tag set distin- 
guishes between auxiliaries and main verbs, finite 
and nonfinite. Also the structure of adverbials 
as well as prepositional and adjective phrases is 
given, though some of the attachments of adver- 
bials is left underspecified.

Syntactic tags are flanked with the @-sign; 2 
morphological tags and the base form are given 
to the left of the syntactic tags. 
3 The exper iment 
This section reports on an experiment on part- 
of-speech and syntactic disambiguation by human 
experts (the authors of this article). Three 2,000- 
word texts were successively used: a software 
manual, a scientific magazine, and a newspaper. 
3.1 Sett ing 
The experiment was conducted as follows. 
1. The text was morphologically analysed us- 
ing the ENGCG morphological nalyser. For 
the analysis of unrecognised words, we used 
a rule-based heuristic omponent that assigns 
morphological nalyses, one or more, to each 
word not represented in the lexicon of the sys- 
tem. 
2. Two experts in the ENGCG grammaticalrep- 
resentation i dependently marked the correct 
alternative analyses in the .ambiguous input, 
using mainly structural, but in some struc- 
turally unresolvable cases also higher-level, 
information. The corpora consisted of con- 
tinuous text rather than isolated sentences; 
this made the use of textual knowledge possi- 
ble in the selection of the correct alternative. 
In the rare cases where two analyses were re- 
garded as equally legitimate, both could be 
marked. The judges were encouraged to con- 
sult the documentation of the grammatical 
representation. 
3. These tagged versions were compared to each 
other using the Unix sdiff program. 
4. The differences were jointly examined by the 
judges in order to see whether they were due 
to (i) inattention, (ii) incomplete specifica- 
tion of the grammatical representation r (iii) 
an undecidable analysis. 
5. A 'consensus' version of the tagged corpus 
was prepared. Usually only a unique analysis 
was given. However, there were three situa- 
tions where a multiple analysis was accepted: 
 When the judges disagree about the cor- 
rect analysis even after negotiations. In 
this case, comments were added to dis- 
tinguish it from the other two types. 
 Neutralisation: both analyses were re- 
garded as equivalent. (This often indi- 
cates a redundancy in the lexicon.) 
2,,@DN>, represents determiners; "@AN>" rep- 
resents premodifying adjectives; "@SUB J" represents 
subjects; "@+FAUXV" represents finite auxiliaries; 
and "@-FMAINV" represents nonfinite m~in verbs. 
 Global ambiguity: the sentence was 
agreed to be globally ambiguous. 
6. Whenever an undefined construction was de- 
tected during the joint examination, the 
grammar definition manual was updated. 
7. The preparation of the syntactic version was 
the next main step. For each contextually 
appropriate morphological reading, all syn- 
tactic tags were introduced with a mapping 
program. An example: 3 
"<*that>" 
" that"  <*> DET CENTRAL DEM SG @DN> 
"<r ouzld>" 
"round" A ABS @AN> 
"<table>" 
"table" N NOM SG @NPHR ~SUBJ @OBJ 
@I-OBJ @PCOMPL-S @PCOMPL-0 
@APP @NN> @<P @O-ADVL 
"<might>" 
"might" V AUXMOD VFIN @+FAUXV 
"<collapse>" 
"collapse" <SVO> V INF @-FMAINV 
@<P-FMAINV @<NOM-FMAINV 
-<$.>,, 
8. Steps 2-6 were applied to these syntactic am- 
biguities. 
This procedure was successively applied to the 
three texts to see how much previous updates of 
the grammar definition manual decreased the need 
for further updates and how much the interjudge 
agreement might increase ven after the first me- 
chanical comparison (cf. Step 3). 
3.2 Results  
The results are given in Figure 1 (next page). 
Some comments are in order, first about mor- 
phology. 
 The initial consistency rate was constantly 
above 99%. 
 After negotiations, the judges agreed about 
the correct analysis or analyses in all cases. 
The vast majority of the initial differences 
were due to inattention, and the remaining 
few to incomplete specification of the mor- 
phological representation. Some representa- 
tive examples about these jointly examined

"@OBJ" represents objects; "@I-OBJ" represents 
indirect objects; "@PCOMPL-S" represents ub- 
ject complements; "@PCOMPL-O" represents ob- 
ject complements; "@APP" represents appositions; 
"@NN>" represents premodifying nouns (and non- 
final noun parts in compounds); "@<P" represents 
nominal preposition complements; "@O-ADVL" rep- 
resents nominal adverbials; "@<P-FMAINV" repre- 
sents nonfinite m~in verbs as preposition comple- 
ments; and "@<NOM-FMAINV" represents post- 
modifying nonfinite main verbs.

 Only three ulSdates were needed to the mor- 
phological part of the manual. 
4Before an "of" phrase, the pronoun/numeral dis- 
tinction of "one" was regarded as neutralised. This 
observation was also added to the morphology manual. 
 Though multiple analyses were considered ac- 
ceptable in the case of (even semantically) un- 
decidable situations, very few were actually 
needed: only 3 words out of 6,071 received 
two analyses (for example, it was agreed that 
more could be analysed both as an adverb 
and as a pronoun in .. free trade will mean 
you destroy more.). 
Next, some observations about syntax. 
 At the level of syntax, most of the initial dif- 
ferences were identified as obvious mistakes, 
e.g.: 
- He was (@+PMAINV/@÷FA UXV) ad- 
dressing his hosts .. 
 Sometimes, however, there was a need to dis- 
cuss the descriptive policies. Consider the fol- 
lowing sentence fragment: 5 
- that managers'(@GN>) keeping 
?@-FMAINV / @SUB J ) in(@ADVL / 
@<NOM) touch with employees en- 
hances communication .. 
In principle, managers'could be described as 
a subject in a nonfinite clause, and keeping 
accordingly as a nonfinite main verb. How- 
ever, the ENGCG syntactic representation 
does not recognise the subject category in 
nonfinite clauses; therefore, in the name of 
consistency, keeping in the above example 
should be assigned a nominal rather than a 
verbal function - finite clause subject, in this 
case .  
 Initially, the syntactic representation was less 
completely specified than the morphological 
representation. The grammar definition man- 
ual initially comprised twelve entries for syn- 
tactic functions; seven additions were made 
s"@GN>" represents genitival premoditlers, and 
"~<NOM" represents postmodifiers. 
213 
during the experiment. This had a positive 
effect: the initial disagreements decreased 
from 4.2% to 2.6% during the three rounds. 
 The entries in the syntax manual can be clas- 
sifted into three types: 
1. Two or more alternatives are struc- 
turally plausible, but one is to be con- 
sistently preferred; e.g. A number that 
occurs after a proper noun and is sur- 
rounded by commas is a postmodifier 
(rather than an apposition) 
2. Elimination of a distinction in certain 
contexts; e.g. Premodifying -ing forms 
are to be analysed as adjectives (rather 
than as nouns) 
3. An unorthodox policy is adopted; e.g. In 
sentences with a formal subject, what is 
usually regarded as a notional subject is 
here analysedas a subject complement. 
 Multiple analyses were given to 32 words 
(0.5% of all words). PP attachment, in par- 
ticular the distinction between clause level 
(@ADVL) and postmodifying (@<NOM) 
functions, proved to be the most difficult syn- 
tactic phenomenon to define uniquely; often 
the analyses remained somewhat indetermi- 
nate. With the first sample, 5.7% of all 
prepositions were initially annotated iffer- 
ently; even with the last sample, 4.5% of the 
initial analyses differed. Unsurprisingly, a fre- 
quent agreement in the analysis of these cases 
was to accept both alternatives as legitimate. 
 Some further examples are in order. These 
examples how some possible structural am- 
biguities in which text-level semantic infor- 
mation was needed to decide upon the pre- 
ferred analysis Y over less plausible alterna- 
tive X. Note that the adopted decision often 
determines the correct analysis of one or more 
subsequent i ems (the "domino effect"). 
1. . .  his priority was (@÷FA UXV 
/ @+FMAINV) keeping his country's 
biotechnology industry free .. 
2. Germany wants the heads of European 
governments and perhaps Japan (@OBJ

minded par~ies". 
3. We were (@-FMAINV / @+FAUXV)

with (@<NOM / @ADVL) the report. 
The last type was recurrent because the 
ENGCG morphology offers only a past participle 
reading to -ed-forms. We prefer the verbal reading 
and predicative -ed-forms are listed as exceptions 
in the coding manual. 
4 Conclusion 
A satisfactory definition of the grammatical rep- 
resentation appears possible, not only at the level 
of morphology, but also at the level of shallow 
dependency-oriented functional syntax. In our 
experiments, a practically 100% consensus was 
reached at both these levels during the joint exam- 
ination. Our results agree, at least at the level of 
morphology, with (Leech and Eyes 1993; Marcus 
et al. 1993). In our experiment, he main differ- 
ences between morphology and syntax were that 
(i) specifying the syntactic representation takes a 
few more pages in the definition manual, and (it) 
there seem to be more cases in syntax where mul- 
tiple analyses have to be accepted - but relatively 
few even then. 
The grammatical representation should employ 
intuitively clear grammatical descriptors that (i) 
represent all constructions in the language and 
(it) reflect distributional distinctions. Proposing 
a too fine-grained classification of e.g. -ing forms, 
as may be the case in the tagged Brown Corpus, 
can make the principled selection of the appro- 
priate analysis very difficult, even with detailed 
manuals. 
As a minor point we may add that errors due to 
inattention tend to occur in the preparation of e.g. 
benchmark corpora; however, almost all of them 
can be eliminated using the double-blind method.
