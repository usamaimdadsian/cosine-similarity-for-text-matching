Abstract
This paper presents a paraphrase acquisition
method that uncovers and exploits generali-
ties underlying paraphrases: paraphrase pat-
terns are first induced and then used to col-
lect novel instances. Unlike existing methods,
ours uses both bilingual parallel and monolin-
gual corpora. While the former are regarded as
a source of high-quality seed paraphrases, the
latter are searched for paraphrases that match
patterns learned from the seed paraphrases.
We show how one can use monolingual cor-
pora, which are far more numerous and larger
than bilingual corpora, to obtain paraphrases
that rival in quality those derived directly from
bilingual corpora. In our experiments, the
number of paraphrase pairs obtained in this
way from monolingual corpora was a large
multiple of the number of seed paraphrases.
Human evaluation through a paraphrase sub-
stitution test demonstrated that the newly ac-
quired paraphrase pairs are of reasonable qual-
ity. Remaining noise can be further reduced
by filtering seed paraphrases.
1 Introduction
Paraphrases are semantically equivalent expressions
in the same language. Because “equivalence” is the
most fundamental semantic relationship, techniques
for generating and recognizing paraphrases play an
important role in a wide range of natural language
processing tasks (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).
In the last decade, automatic acquisition of knowl-
edge about paraphrases from corpora has been draw-
ing the attention of many researchers. Typically, the
acquired knowledge is simply represented as pairs of
semantically equivalent sub-sentential expressions
as in (1).
(1) a. look like ? resemble
b. control system ? controller
The challenge in acquiring paraphrases is to ensure
good coverage of the targeted classes of paraphrases
along with a low proportion of incorrect pairs. How-
ever, no matter what type of resource has been used,
it has proven difficult to acquire paraphrase pairs
with both high recall and high precision.
Among various types of corpora, monolingual
corpora can be considered the best source for high-
coverage paraphrase acquisition, because there is
far more monolingual than bilingual text avail-
able. Most methods that exploit monolingual cor-
pora rely on the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris,
1968): expressions that appear in similar contexts
are expected to have similar meaning. However,
if one uses purely distributional criteria, it is dif-
ficult to distinguish real paraphrases from pairs of
expressions that are related in other ways, such as
antonyms and cousin words.
In contrast, since the work in (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005), bilingual parallel corpora
have been acknowledged as a good source of high-
quality paraphrases: paraphrases are obtained by
putting together expressions that receive the same
translation in the other language (pivot language).
Because translation expresses a specific meaning
more directly than context in the aforementioned ap-
proach, pairs of expressions acquired in this manner
tend to be correct paraphrases. However, the cov-
erage problem remains: there is much less bilingual
parallel than monolingual text available.
Our objective in this paper is to obtain para-
phrases that have high quality (like those extracted
from bilingual parallel corpora via pivoting) but can
be generated in large quantity (like those extracted
631
from monolingual corpora via contextual similar-
ity). To achieve this, we propose a method that ex-
ploits general patterns underlying paraphrases and
uses both bilingual parallel and monolingual sources
of information. Given a relatively high-quality set of
paraphrases obtained from a bilingual parallel cor-
pus, a set of paraphrase patterns is first induced.
Then, appropriate instances of such patterns, i.e.,
potential paraphrases, are harvested from a mono-
lingual corpus.
After reviewing existing methods in Section 2,
our method is presented in Section 3. Section 4
describes our experiments in acquiring paraphrases
and presents statistics summarizing the coverage of
our method. Section 5 describes a human evaluation
of the quality of the acquired paraphrases. Finally,
Section 6 concludes this paper.
2 Literature on Paraphrase Acquisition
This section summarizes existing corpus-based
methods for paraphrase acquisition, following the
classification in (Hashimoto et al., 2011): similarity-
based and alignment-based methods.
2.1 Similarity-based Methods
Techniques that use monolingual (non-parallel) cor-
pora mostly rely on the Distributional Hypothesis
(Harris, 1968). Because a large quantity of mono-
lingual data is available for many languages, a large
number of paraphrase candidates can be acquired
(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pas¸ca and Dienes, 2005; Bha-
gat and Ravichandran, 2008, etc.). The recipes pro-
posed so far are based on three main ingredients, i.e.,
features used for representing context of target ex-
pression (contextual features), criteria for weighting
and filtering features, and aggregation functions.
A drawback of relying only on contextual simi-
larity is that it tends to give high scores to semanti-
cally related but non-equivalent expressions, such as
antonyms and cousin words. To enhance the preci-
sion of the results, filtering mechanisms need to be
introduced (Marton et al., 2011).
2.2 Alignment-based Methods
Pairs of expressions that get translated to the same
expression in a different language can be regarded as
paraphrases. On the basis of this hypothesis, Barzi-
lay and McKeown (2001) and Pang et al. (2003)
created monolingual parallel corpora from multiple
human translations of the same source. Then, they
extracted corresponding parts of such parallel sen-
tences as sub-sentential paraphrases.
Leveraging recent advances in statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT), Bannard and Callison-
Burch (2005) proposed a method for acquiring sub-
sentential paraphrases from bilingual parallel cor-
pora. As in SMT, a translation table is first built on
the basis of alignments between expressions, such as
words, phrases, and subtrees, across a parallel sen-
tence pair. Then, pairs of expressions (e1, e2) in the
same language that are aligned with the same ex-
pressions in the other language (pivot language) are
extracted as paraphrases. The likelihood of e2 being
a paraphrase of e1 is given by
p(e2|e1) =
?
f?Tr(e1,e2)
p(e2|f)p(f |e1), (1)
where Tr(e1, e2) stands for the set of shared trans-
lations of e1 and e2. Each factor p(e|f) and p(f |e)
is estimated from the number of times e and f are
aligned and the number of occurrences of each ex-
pression in each language. Kok and Brockett (2010)
showed how one can discover paraphrases that do
not share any translation in one language by travers-
ing a graph created from multiple translation tables,
each corresponding to a bilingual parallel corpus.
This approach, however, suffers from a cover-
age problem, because both monolingual parallel and
bilingual parallel corpora tend to be significantly
smaller than monolingual non-parallel corpora. The
acquired pairs of expressions include some non-
paraphrases as well. Many of these come from er-
roneous alignments, which are particularly frequent
when the given corpus is small.
Monolingual comparable corpora have also been
exploited as sources of paraphrases using alignment-
based methods. For instance, multiple news arti-
cles covering the same event (Shinyama et al., 2002;
Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004; Wubben
et al., 2009) have been used. Such corpora have
also been created manually through crowdsourcing
(Chen and Dolan, 2011). However, the availabil-
ity of monolingual comparable corpora is very lim-
ited for most languages; thus, approaches relying
on these corpora have typically produced only very
632
small collections of paraphrases. Hashimoto et al.
(2011) found a way around this limitation by collect-
ing sentences that constitute explicit definitions of
particular words or phrases from monolingual non-
parallel Web documents, pairing sentences that de-
fine the same noun phrase, and then finding corre-
sponding phrases in each sentence pair. One limita-
tion of this approach is that it requires a considerable
amount of labeled data for both the corpus construc-
tion and the paraphrase extraction steps.
2.3 Summary
Existing methods have investigated one of the fol-
lowing four types of corpora as their principal re-
source1: monolingual non-parallel corpora, mono-
lingual parallel corpora, monolingual comparable
corpora, and bilingual parallel corpora. No matter
what type of resource has been used, however, it
has proven difficult to acquire paraphrases with both
high recall and precision, with the possible excep-
tion of the method in (Hashimoto et al., 2011) which
requires large amounts of labeled data.
3 Proposed Method
While most existing methods deal with expressions
only at the surface level, ours exploits generalities
underlying paraphrases to achieve better coverage
while retaining high precision. Furthermore, unlike
existing methods, ours uses both bilingual parallel
and monolingual non-parallel corpora as sources for
acquiring paraphrases.
The process is illustrated in Figure 1. First, a
set of high-quality seed paraphrases, PSeed , is ac-
quired from bilingual parallel corpora by using an
alignment-based method. Then, our method collects
further paraphrases through the following two steps.
Generalization (Step 2): Paraphrase patterns are
learned from the seed paraphrases, PSeed .
Instantiation (Step 3): A novel set of paraphrase
pairs, PHvst , is finally harvested from mono-
lingual non-parallel corpora using the learned
patterns; each newly acquired paraphrase pair
is assessed by contextual similarity.
1Chan et al. (2011) used monolingual corpora only for re-
ranking paraphrases obtained from bilingual parallel corpora.
To the best of our knowledge, bilingual comparable corpora
have never been used as sources for acquiring paraphrases.

3.1 Step 1. Seed Paraphrase Acquisition
The goal of the first step is to obtain a set of high-
quality paraphrase pairs, PSeed .
For this purpose, alignment-based methods with
bilingual or monolingual parallel corpora are prefer-
able to similarity-based methods applied to non-
parallel corpora. Among various options, in this pa-
per, we start from the standard technique proposed
by Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) with bilin-
gual parallel corpora (see also Section 2.2). In par-
ticular, we assume the phrase-based SMT frame-
work (Koehn et al., 2003). Then, we purify the re-
sults with several filtering methods.
The phrase pair extraction process of phrase-
based SMT systems aims at high recall for increased
robustness of the translation process. As a result,
a naive application of the paraphrase acquisition
method produces pairs of expressions that are not
exact paraphrases. For instance, the algorithm ex-
plained in Koehn (2009, p.134) extracts both “dass”
and “, dass” as counterparts of “that” from the sen-
tence pair. To reduce that kind of noise, we apply
some filtering techniques to the candidate translation
pairs. First, statistically unreliable translation pairs
(Johnson et al., 2007) are filtered out. Then, we also
filter out phrases made up entirely of stop words (in-
cluding punctuation marks), both in the language of
interest and in the pivot language.
Let PRaw be the initial set of paraphrase pairs ex-
tracted from the sanitized translation table. We first

discard pairs whose difference comprises only stop
words, such as “the schools” ? “schools and”. We
also remove pairs containing only singular-plural
differences, such as “family unit” ? “family units”.
Depending on the language of interest, other types of
morphological variants, such as those shown in (2),
may also be ignored.
(2) a. “europe´enne” ? “europe´en”
(Gender in French)
b. “guten Lo¨sungen” ? “gute Lo¨sungen”
(Case in German)
We further filter out less reliable pairs, such as
those shown with dotted lines in Figures 2 and 3.
This is carried out by comparing the right-hand side
(RHS) phrases of each left-hand side (LHS) phrase,
and vice versa2. Given a set of paraphrase pairs,
RHS phrases corresponding to the same LHS phrase
lp are compared. A RHS phrase rp is not licensed iff
lp has another RHS phrase rp? (?= rp) which satis-
fies the following two conditions (see also Figure 2).
• rp? is a word sub-sequence of rp
• rp? is a more likely paraphrase than rp,
i.e., p(rp ?|lp) > p(rp|lp)
LHS phrases for each RHS phrase rp are also com-
pared in a similar manner, i.e., a LHS phrase lp is
not qualified as a legitimate source of rp iff rp has
another LHS phrase lp? (?= lp) which satisfies the
following conditions (see also Figure 3).
• lp? is a word sub-sequence of lp
• lp? is a more likely source than lp,
i.e., p(lp ?|rp) > p(lp|rp)
The two directions of filtering are separately applied
and the intersection of their results is retained.
2cf. Denkowski and Lavie (2011); they only compared each
RHS phrase to its corresponding LHS phrase.
Candidate pairs are finally filtered on the basis
of their reliability score. Traditionally, a threshold
(thp) on the conditional probability given by Eq. (1)
is used (Du et al., 2010; Max, 2010; Denkowski
and Lavie, 2011, etc.). Furthermore, we also re-
quire that LHS and RHS phrases exceed a thresh-
old (ths ) on their contextual similarity in a mono-
lingual corpus. This paper neither proposes a spe-
cific recipe nor makes a comprehensive comparison
of existing recipes for computing contextual simi-
larity, although one particular recipe is used in our
experiments (see Section 4.1).
3.2 Step 2. Paraphrase Pattern Induction
From a set of seed paraphrases, PSeed , paraphrase
patterns are induced. For instance, from paraphrases
in (3), we induce paraphrase patterns in (4).
(3) a. “restraint system” ? “restraint apparatus”
b. “movement against racism”
? “anti-racism movement”
c. “middle eastern countries”
? “countries in the middle east”
(4) a. “X system” ? “X apparatus”
b. “X against Y ” ? “anti-Y X”
c. “X eastern Y ” ? “Y in the X east”
Word pairs of LHS and RHS phrases will be re-
placed with variable slots iff they are fully identi-
cal or singular-plural variants. Note that stop words
are retained. While a deeper level of lexical cor-
respondences, such as “eastern” and “east” in (3c)
and “system” and “apparatus” in (3a), could be cap-
tured, this would require the use of rich language
resources, thereby making the method less portable
to resource-poor languages.
634
Note that our aim is to automatically capture gen-
eral paraphrase patterns of the kind that have some-
times been manually described (Jacquemin, 1999;
Fujita et al., 2007). This is different from ap-
proaches that attach variable slots to paraphrases for
calculating their similarity (Lin and Pantel, 2001;
Szpektor and Dagan, 2008) or for constraining
the context in which they are regarded legitimate
(Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009).
3.3 Step 3. Paraphrase Instance Acquisition
Given a set of paraphrase patterns, such as those
shown in (4), a set of novel instances, i.e., novel
paraphrases, PHvst , will now be harvested from
monolingual non-parallel corpora. In other words,
a set of appropriate slot-fillers will be extracted.
First, expressions that match both elements of
the pattern, except stop words, are collected from
a given monolingual corpus. Pattern matching alone
may generate inappropriate pairs, so we then assess
the legitimacy of each collected slot-filler.
Let LHS (w) and RHS (w) be the expressions
generated by instantiating the k variable slots in
LHS and RHS phrases of the pattern with a k-tuple
of slot-fillers w (= w1, . . . , wk), respectively. We
estimate how likelyRHS (w) is to be a paraphrase of
LHS (w) based on the contextual similarity between
them using a monolingual corpus; a pair of phrases
is discarded if they are used in substantially dissim-
ilar contexts. We use the same recipe and threshold
value for ths with Step 1 in our experiments.
Contextual similarity of antonyms and cousin
words can also be high, as they are often used in sim-
ilar contexts. However, this is not a problem in our
framework, because semantic equivalence between
LHS (w) and RHS (w) is almost entirely guaran-
teed as a result of the way the corresponding patterns
were learned from a bilingual parallel corpus.
3.4 Characteristics
In terms of coverage, PHvst is expected to be greatly
larger than PSeed , although it will not cover to-
tally different pairs of paraphrases, such as those
shown in (1). On the other hand, the quality of
PHvst depends on that of PSeed . Unlike in the pure
similarity-based method, PHvst is constrained by the
paraphrase patterns derived from the set of high-
quality paraphrases, PSeed , and will therefore gen-
erally exclude the kind of semantically similar but
non-equivalent pairs that contextual similarity alone
tends to extract alongside real paraphrases.
As mentioned in Section 3.1, other types of meth-
ods can be used for obtaining high-quality seed
paraphrases, PSeed . For instance, the supervised
method proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2011) uses
the existence of shared words as a feature to deter-
mine whether the given pair of expressions are para-
phrases, and thereby extracts many pairs sharing the
same words. Thus, their output has a high potential
to be used as an alternative seed for our method.
Another advantage of our method is that it does
not require any labeled data, unlike the super-
vised methods proposed by Zhao et al. (2009) and
Hashimoto et al. (2011).
4 Quantitative Impact
4.1 Experimental Settings
Two different sets of corpora were used as data
sources; in both settings, we acquired English para-
phrases.
Europarl: The English-French version of the Eu-
roparl Parallel Corpus3 consisting of 1.8M sen-
tence pairs (51M words in English and 56M
words in French) was used as a bilingual par-
allel corpus, while its English side and the En-
glish side of the 109 French-English corpus4
consisting of 23.8M sentences (649M words)
were used as monolingual data.
Patent: The Japanese-English Patent Translation
data (Fujii et al., 2010) consisting of 3.2M sen-
tence pairs (122M morphemes in Japanese and
106Mwords in English) was used as a bilingual
parallel corpus, while its English side and the
30.0M sentences (626M words) from the 2007
chapter of NTCIR unaligned patent documents
were used as monolingual data.
To study the behavior of our method for different
amounts of bilingual parallel data, we carried out
learning curve experiments.
We used our in-house tokenizer for segmentation
of English and French sentences and MeCab5 for
Japanese sentences.

Figure 4: # of paraphrase pairs in PSeed (left: Europarl, right: Patent).
Stop word lists for sanitizing translation pairs and
paraphrase pairs were manually compiled: we enu-
merated 442 English words, 193 French words, and
149 Japanese morphemes, respectively.
From a bilingual parallel corpus, a translation ta-
ble was created by our in-house phrase-based SMT
system, PORTAGE (Sadat et al., 2005). Phrase
alignments of each sentence pair were identified by
the heuristic “grow-diag-final”6 with a maximum
phrase length 8. The resulting translation pairs were
then filtered with the significance pruning technique
of (Johnson et al., 2007), using ? + ? as threshold.
As contextual features for computing similarity
of each paraphrase pair, all of the 1- to 4-grams of
words adjacent to each occurrence of a phrase were
counted. This is a compromise between less expen-
sive but noisier approaches, such as bag-of-words,
and more accurate but more expensive approaches
that incorporate syntactic features (Lin and Pantel,
2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2003;
Szpektor and Dagan, 2008). Contextual similarity is
finally measured by taking cosine between two fea-
ture vectors.
4.2 Statistics on Acquired Paraphrases
Seed Paraphrases (PSeed )
Figure 4 shows the number of paraphrase pairs
PSeed obtained from the bilingual parallel corpora.
The general trend is simply that the larger the cor-
pus is, the more paraphrases are acquired.
Given the initial set of paraphrases, PRaw (“×”),
our filtering techniques (“
2
”) discarded a large por-
tion (63-75% in Europarl and 43-64% in Patent) of
them. Pairs with zero similarity were also filtered
out, i.e., ths = ?. This suggests that many incorrect
6http://statmt.org/moses/?n=FactoredTraining.AlignWords
and/or relatively useless pairs, such as those shown
in Figures 2 and 3, had originally been acquired.
Lines with “?” show the results based on a
widely-used threshold value on the conditional prob-
ability in Eq. (1), i.e., thp = 0.01 (Du et al., 2010;
Max, 2010; Denkowski and Lavie, 2011, etc.). The
percentage of paraphrase pairs thereby discarded
varied greatly depending on the corpus size (17-78%
in Europarl and 31-82% in Patent), suggesting that
the threshold value should be determined depending
on the given corpus. In the following experiment,
however, we conform to the convention thp = 0.01
(“?”) to ensure the quality of PSeed that we will be
using for inducing paraphrase patterns, even though
this results in discarding some less frequent but cor-
rect paraphrase pairs, such as “control apparatus”
? “controlling device” in Figure 2.
Paraphrase Patterns
Figures 5 and 6 show the number of paraphrase
patterns that our method induced and their cover-
age against PSeed , respectively. Due to their rather
rigid form, the patterns covered no more than 15%
of PSeed in Europarl. In contrast, a higher propor-
tion of PSeed in Patent was generalized into patterns.
We speculate it is because the patent domain con-
tains many expressions, including technical terms,
that have similar variations of constructions.
The acquired patterns were mostly one-variable
patterns: 88-93% and 80-91% of total patterns for
different variants of the Europarl and Patent set-
tings, respectively. Given that there are far more
one-variable patterns than other types, and that one-
variable patterns are the simplest type, we hence-
forth focus on them. More complex patterns, includ-
ing two-variable patterns (7-11% and 8-17% in each
setting), will be investigated in our future work.

Novel Paraphrases (PHvst )
Using the paraphrase patterns, novel paraphrase
pairs, PHvst , were harvested from the monolingual
non-parallel corpora. In this experiment, we only
retained one-variable patterns and regarded only sin-
gle words as slot-fillers for them. Nevertheless, we
managed to acquire a large number of paraphrase
pairs as depicted in Figure 7, where pairs having
zero similarity were excluded. For instance, when
the full size of bilingual parallel corpus in Patent was
used, we acquired 1.41M pairs of seed paraphrases,
PSeed , and 28.7M pairs of novel paraphrases, PHvst .
In other words, our method expanded PSeed by about
21 times. The number of unique LHS phrases that
PHvst covers was also significantly larger than that
of PSeed .
Figure 8 highlights the remarkably large ratio of
PHvst to PSeed in terms of the number of paraphrase
pairs and the number of unique LHS phrases. The
smaller the bilingual corpus is, the higher the ratio
is, except when there is only a very small amount of
Europarl data. This demonstrates that our method is
quite powerful, given a minimum amount of data.
Another striking difference between PSeed and
PHvst is the average number of RHS phrases per
unique LHS phrase, i.e., their relative yield. As
displayed in Figure 9, the yield for PHvst increased
rapidly with the scaling up of the bilingual cor-
pus, while that of PSeed only grew slowly. The
alignment-based method with bilingual corpora can-
not produce very many RHS phrases per unique
LHS phrase due to its reliance on conditional prob-
ability and the surface level processing. In con-
trast, our method does not limit the number of RHS
phrases: each RHS phrase is separately assessed by
its similarity to the corresponding LHS phrase. One
limitation of our method is that it cannot achieve
high yield for PHvst whenever only a small num-
ber of paraphrase patterns can be extracted from the
bilingual corpus (see also Figure 5).
Both the ratio of PHvst to PSeed and the relative
yield could probably be increased by scaling up the
monolingual corpus. For instance, in the patent do-
main, monolingual documents 10 times larger than
the one used in the above experiments are avail-
able at the NTCIR project7. It would be interesting
to compare the relative gains brought by in-domain
versus general-purpose corpora.

(left: probability-based (0.01 ? thp ? 0.9, ths = ?), right: similarity-based (? ? ths ? 0.9, thp = 0.01))
Finally, we investigated how the number of para-
phrase pairs varies depending on the values for the
two thresholds, i.e., thp on the conditional probabil-
ity and ths on the contextual similarity, respectively.
Figure 10 shows the results when the full sizes of
bilingual corpora are used. When the pairs were fil-
tered only with thp , the number of paraphrase pairs
in PHvst decreased more slowly than that of PSeed
according to the increase of the threshold value. This
is a benefit from our generalization and instantiation
method. The same paraphrase pattern is often in-
duced from more than one paraphrase pair in PSeed .
Thus, as long as at least one of them has a proba-
bility higher than the given threshold value, corre-
sponding novel paraphrases can be harvested.
On the other hand, as a results of assessing each
individual paraphrase pair by the contextual similar-
ity, many pairs in PHvst , which are supposed to be
incorrect instances of their corresponding pattern,
are filtered out by a larger threshold value for ths .
In contrast, many pairs in PSeed have a relatively
high similarity, e.g., 40% of all pairs have similarity
higher than 0.4. This indicates the quality of PSeed
is highly guaranteed by the shared translations.
5 Human Evaluation of Quality
To confirm that the quality of PHvst is sufficiently
high, we carried out a substitution test.
First, by substituting sub-sentential paraphrases
to existing sentences in a given test corpus, pairs
of slightly different sentences were automatically
generated. For instance, by applying “looks like”
? “resembles” to (5), (6) was generated.
(5) The roof looks like a prehistoric lizard’s spine.
(6) The roof resembles a prehistoric lizard’s spine.
Human evaluators were then asked to score each
pair of an original sentence and a paraphrased sen-
tence with the following two 5-point scale grades
proposed by Callison-Burch (2008):
Grammaticality: whether the paraphrased sen-
tence is grammatical (1: horrible, 5: perfect)
Meaning: whether the meaning of the original sen-
tence is properly retained by the paraphrased
sentence (1: totally different, 5: equivalent)
To make results more consistent and reduce the
human labor, evaluators were asked to rate at the
same time several paraphrases for the same source
phrase. For instance, given a source sentence (5), the
638
evaluators might be given the following sentences in
addition to a paraphrased sentence (6).
(7) The roof seems like a prehistoric lizard’s spine.
(8) The roofwould look like a prehistoric lizard’s spine.
In this experiment, we showed five paraphrases
per source phrase, assuming that evaluators would
get confused if too large a number of paraphrase
candidates were presented at the same time.
5.1 Data for Evaluation
As in previous work (Callison-Burch, 2008; Chan
et al., 2011), we evaluated paraphrases acquired
from the Europarl corpus on news sentences. Para-
phrase examples were automatically generated from
the English part ofWMT 2008-2011 “newstest” data
(10,050 unique sentences) by applying the union of
PSeed and PHvst of the Europarl setting (19.3M para-
phrases for 5.95M phrases).
On the other hand, paraphrases acquired from
patent documents are much more difficult to eval-
uate due to the following reasons. First, they may
be too domain-specific to be of any use in general
areas such as news sentences. However, conduct-
ing an in-domain evaluation would be difficult with-
out enrolling domain experts. We expect that para-
phrases from a domain can be used safely in that
domain. Nevertheless, deciding under what circum-
stances they can be used safely in another domain is
an interesting research question.
To reduce the human labor for the evaluation, sen-
tences were restricted to those with moderate length:
10-30 words, which are expected to provide suf-
ficient but succinct context. To propose multiple
paraphrase candidates at the same time, we also re-
stricted phrases to be paraphrased (LHS phrases) to
those having at least five paraphrases including ones
from PHvst . This resulted in 60,421 paraphrases for
988 phrase tokens (353 unique phrases).
Finally, we randomly sampled 80 unique phrase
tokens and five unique paraphrases for each phrase
token (400 examples in total), and asked six people
having a high level of English proficiency to evalu-
ate them. Inter-evaluator agreement was calculated
from five different pairs of evaluators, each judging
the same 10 examples. The remaining 350 exam-
ples were divided into six chunks of slightly unequal
length, with each chunk being judged by one of the
six evaluators.
5-point Binary
n G M G M Both
PSeed 55 4.60 4.35 0.85 0.93 0.78
PHvst 295 4.22 3.35 0.74 0.67 0.55
Total 350 4.28 3.50 0.76 0.71 0.58
Table 1: Avg. score and precision of binary classification.
5.2 Results
Table 1 shows the average of the original 5-point
scale scores and the percentage of examples that
are judged correct based on a binary judgment
(Callison-Burch, 2008): an example is considered to
be correct iff the grammaticality score is 4 or above
and/or the meaning score is 3 or above. Paraphrases
based on PSeed achieved a quite high performance
in both grammaticality (“G”) and meaning (“M”) in
part because of the effectiveness of our filtering tech-
niques. The performance of paraphrases drawn from
PHvst was reasonably high and similar to the scores
0.68 for grammaticality, 0.61 for meaning, and 0.55
for both, of the best model reported in (Callison-
Burch, 2008), although it was inferior to PSeed .
Despite the fact that all of our evaluators had a
high-level command of English, the agreement was
not very high. This was true even when the col-
lected scores were mapped into binary classes. In
this case, the ? values (Cohen, 1960) for each crite-
rion were 0.45 and 0.45, respectively, which indicate
the agreement was “fair”. To obtain a better ? value,
the criteria for grading will need to be improved.
However, we think that was not too low either8.
The most promising way for improving the qual-
ity of PHvst is to ensure that paraphrase patterns
cover only legitimate paraphrases. We investigated
this by filtering the manually scored paraphrase ex-
amples with two thresholds for cleaning seed para-
phrases PSeed : thp on the conditional probability es-
timated using the bilingual parallel corpus and ths
on the contextual similarity in the monolingual non-
parallel corpus. Figure 11 shows the average score
of the examples whose corresponding paraphrase is
obtainable with the given threshold values. Note that
the points in the figure with higher threshold values
are less reliable than the others, because filtering re-
duces the number of the manually scored examples
8Note that Callison-Burch (2008) might possibly underesti-
mate the chance agreement and overestimate the ? values, be-
cause the distribution of human scores would not be uniform.

used to calculate scores. Nevertheless, it indicates
that better filtering of PSeed with higher threshold
values is likely to produce a better-quality set of
paraphrases PHvst . For instance, an inappropriate
paraphrase pattern (9a) was excluded with thp = 0.1
or ths = 0.1, while correct ones (9b) and (9c) re-
mained even when a large threshold value is used.

Kendall’s correlation coefficient ?B (Kendall,
1938) between the contextual similarity and each of
the human scores were 0.24 for grammaticality and
0.21 for meaning, respectively. Although they are ri-
valing the best results reported in (Chan et al., 2011),
i.e., 0.24 and 0.21, similarity metrics should be fur-
ther investigated to realize a more accurate filtering.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we exploited general patterns under-
lying paraphrases to acquire automatically a large
number of high-quality paraphrase pairs using both
bilingual parallel and monolingual non-parallel cor-
pora. Experiments using two sets of corpora demon-
strated that our method is able to leverage informa-
tion in a relatively small bilingual parallel corpus
to exploit large amounts of information in a rela-
tively large monolingual non-parallel corpus. Hu-
man evaluation through a paraphrase substitution
test revealed that the acquired paraphrases are gen-
erally of reasonable quality. Our original objective
was to extract from monolingual corpora a large
quantity of paraphrases whose quality is as high as
that of paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora.
We have met the quantity part of the objective, and
have come close to meeting the quality part.
There are three main directions for our future
work. First, we intend to carry out in-depth anal-
yses of the proposed method. For instance, while
we showed that the performance of phrase substi-
tution could be improved by removing noisy seed
paraphrases, this also strongly affected the quan-
tity. We will therefore investigate similarity metrics
in our future work. Other interesting questions re-
lated to the work presented here are, as mentioned in
Section 4.2, exploitation of patterns with more than
one variable, learning curve experiments with dif-
ferent amounts of monolingual data, and compari-
son of in-domain and general-purpose monolingual
corpora. Second, we have an interest in exploiting
sophisticated paraphrase patterns; for instance, by
inducing patterns hierarchically (recursively) and in-
corporating lexical resources such as those exempli-
fied in (4). Finally, the developed paraphrase col-
lection will be attested through applications, such
as sentence compression (Cohn and Lapata, 2008;
Ganitkevitch et al., 2011) and machine translation
(Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Marton et al., 2009).
