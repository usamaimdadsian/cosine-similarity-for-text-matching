Abstract
Much attention has been given to the
impact of informativeness and similar-
ity measures on distributional thesauri.
We investigate the effects of context fil-
ters on thesaurus quality and propose the
use of cooccurrence frequency as a sim-
ple and inexpensive criterion. For eval-
uation, we measure thesaurus agreement
with WordNet and performance in answer-
ing TOEFL-like questions. Results illus-
trate the sensitivity of distributional the-
sauri to filters.
1 Introduction
Large-scale distributional thesauri created auto-
matically from corpora (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin,
1998; Weeds et al., 2004; Ferret, 2012) are an
inexpensive and fast alternative for representing
semantic relatedness between words, when man-
ually constructed resources like WordNet (Fell-
baum, 1998) are unavailable or lack coverage. To
construct a distributional thesaurus, the (colloca-
tional or syntactic) contexts in which a target word
occurs are used as the basis for calculating its sim-
ilarity with other words. That is, two words are
similar if they share a large proportion of contexts.
Much attention has been devoted to refin-
ing thesaurus quality, improving informativeness
and similarity measures (Lin, 1998; Curran and
Moens, 2002; Ferret, 2010), identifying and de-
moting bad neighbors (Ferret, 2013), or using
more relevant contexts (Broda et al., 2009; Bie-
mann and Riedl, 2013). For the latter in particular,
as words vary in their collocational tendencies, it
is difficult to determine how informative a given
context is. To remove uninformative and noisy
contexts, filters have often been applied like point-
wise mutual information (PMI), lexicographer’s
mutual information (LMI) (Biemann and Riedl,
2013), t-score (Piasecki et al., 2007) and z-score
(Broda et al., 2009). However, the selection of a
measure and of a threshold value for these filters
is generally empirically determined. We argue that
these filtering parameters have a great influence on
the quality of the generated thesauri.
The goal of this paper is to quantify the im-
pact of context filters on distributional thesauri.
We experiment with different filter methods and
measures to assess context significance. We pro-
pose the use of simple cooccurrence frequency as
a filter and show that it leads to better results than
more expensive measures such as LMI or PMI.
Thus we propose a cheap and effective way of fil-
tering contexts while maintaining quality.
This paper is organized as follows: in §2 we
discuss evaluation of distributional thesauri. The
methodology adopted in the work and the results
are discussed in §3 and §4. We finish with some
conclusions and discussion of future work.
2 Related Work
In a nutshell, the standard approach to build a dis-
tributional thesaurus consists of: (i) the extraction
of contexts for the target words from corpora, (ii)
the application of an informativeness measure to
represent these contexts and (iii) the application of
a similarity measure to compare sets of contexts.
The contexts in which a target word appears can
be extracted in terms of a window of cooccurring
(content) words surrounding the target (Freitag et
al., 2005; Ferret, 2012; Erk and Pado, 2010) or in
terms of the syntactic dependencies in which the
target appears (Lin, 1998; McCarthy et al., 2003;
Weeds et al., 2004). The informativeness of each
context is calculated using measures like PMI, and
t-test while the similarity between contexts is cal-
culated using measures like Lin’s (1998), cosine,
Jensen-Shannon divergence, Dice or Jaccard.
Evaluation of the quality of distributional the-
sauri is a well know problem in the area (Lin,
419
1998; Curran and Moens, 2002). For instance, for
intrinsic evaluation, the agreement between the-
sauri has been examined, looking at the average
similarity of a word in the thesauri (Lin, 1998),
and at the overlap and rank agreement between the
thesauri for target words like nouns (Weeds et al.,
2004). Although much attention has been given to
the evaluation of various informativeness and sim-
ilarity measures, a careful assessment of the ef-
fects of filtering on the resulting thesauri is also
needed. For instance, Biemann and Riedl (2013)
found that filtering a subset of contexts based on
LMI increased the similarity of a thesaurus with
WordNet. In this work, we compare the impact of
using different types of filters in terms of thesaurus
agreement with WordNet, focusing on a distribu-
tional thesaurus of English verbs. We also propose
a frequency-based saliency measure to rank and
filter contexts and compare it with PMI and LMI.
Extrinsic evaluation of distributional thesauri
has been carried out for tasks such as En-
glish lexical substitution (McCarthy and Navigli,
2009), phrasal verb compositionality detection
(McCarthy et al., 2003) and the WordNet-based
synonymy test (WBST) (Freitag et al., 2005). For
comparative purposes in this work we adopt the
latter.
3 Methodology
We focus on thesauri of English verbs constructed
from the BNC (Burnard, 2007)
1
. Contexts are ex-
tracted from syntactic dependencies generated by
RASP (Briscoe et al., 2006), using nouns (heads
of NPs) which have subject and direct object rela-
tions with the target verb. Thus, each target verb
is represented by a set of triples containing (i) the
verb itself, (ii) a context noun and (iii) a syntac-
tic relation (object, subject). The thesauri were
constructed using Lin’s (1998) method. Lin’s ver-
sion of the distributional hypothesis states that two
words (verbs v
1
and v
2
in our case) are similar if
they share a large proportion of contexts weighted
by their information content, assessed with PMI
(Bansal et al., 2012; Turney, 2013).
In the literature, little attention is paid to context
filters. To investigate their impact, we compare
two kinds of filters, and before calculating similar-
ity using Lin’s measure, we apply them to remove

tional carefully constructed corpus with representative sam-
ples of written English to control the quality of the thesaurus.
potentially noisy triples:
• Threshold (th): we remove triples that oc-
cur less than a threshold th. Threshold values
vary from 1 to 50 counts per triple.
• Relevance (p): we keep only the top p most
relevant contexts for each verb, were rele-
vance is defined according to the following
measures: (a) frequency, (b) PMI, and (c)
LMI (Biemann and Riedl, 2013). Values of
p vary between 10 and 1000.
In this work, we want to answer two ques-
tions: (a) Do more selective filters improve intrin-
sic evaluation of thesaurus? and (b) Do they also
help in extrinsic evaluation?
For intrinsic evaluation, we determine agree-
ment between a distributional thesaurus and Word-
Net as the path similarities for the first k distri-
butional neighbors of a verb. A single score is
obtained by averaging the similarities of all verbs
with their k first neighbors. The higher this score
is, the closer the neighbors are to the target in
WordNet, and the better the thesaurus. Several
values of k were tested and the results showed ex-
actly the same curve shapes for all values, with
WordNet similarity decreasing linearly with k. For
the remainder of the paper we adopt k = 10, as it
is widely used in the literature.
For extrinsic evaluation, we use the WBST set
for verbs (Freitag et al., 2005) with 7,398 ques-
tions and an average polysemy of 10.4. The task
consists of choosing the most suitable synonym
for a word among a set of four options. The the-
saurus is used to rank the candidate answers by
similarity scores, and select the first one as the
correct synonym. As discussed by Freitag et al.
(2005), the upper bound reached by English na-
tive speakers is 88.4% accuracy, and simple lower
bounds are 25% (random choice) and 34.5% (al-
ways choosing the most frequent option).

of WordNet path. Confidence interval is arround ± 0.002 in all cases.
When using a threshold filter (Figure 1 left),
high values lead to better performance for mid-
and low-frequency verbs. This is because, for high
th values, there are few low and mid-frequency
verbs left, since a verb that occurs less has less
chances to be seen often in the same context. The
similarity for verbs with no contexts over the fre-
quency threshold cannot be assessed and as a con-
sequence those verbs are not included in the fi-
nal thesaurus. As Figure 2 shows, the number
of verbs decreases much faster for low and mid
frequency verbs when th increases.
3
For exam-
ple, for th = 50, there are only 7 remaining low-
frequency verbs in the thesaurus and these tend
to be idiosyncratic multiword expressions. One
example is wreak, and the only triple contain-
ing this verb that appeared more than 50 times is
wreak havoc (71 occurrences). The neighbors of
this verb are cause and play, which yield a good
similarity score in WordNet. Therefore, although
higher thresholds result in higher similarities for
low and mid-frequency verbs, this comes at a cost,
as the number of verbs included in the thesaurus
decreases considerably.

vary and is the same shown in Figure 2 for th = 1 (no filter).

As expected, the best performance is obtained
for high-frequency verbs and no filter, since it re-
sults in more context information per verb. In-
creasing th decreases similarity due to the removal
of some of these contexts. In average, higher th
values lead to better overall similarity among the
frequency ranges (from 0.148 with th = 1 to
0.164 with th = 50). The higher the threshold,
the more high-frequency verbs will prevail in the
thesauri, for which the WordNet path similarities
are higher.

filter of keeping the p most relevant contexts for
each verb (Figure 1 right), we obtain similar re-
sults, but more stable thesauri. The number of
verbs remains constant, since we keep a fixed
number of contexts for each verb and verbs are not
removed when the threshold is modified. Word-
Net similarity increases as more contexts are taken
into account, for all frequency ranges. There is a
maximum around p = 200, though larger values
do not lead to a drastic drop in quality. This sug-
gests that the noise introduced by low-frequency
contexts is compensated by the increase of infor-
mativeness for other contexts. An ideal balance
is reached by the lowest possible p that maintains
high WordNet similarity, since the lower the p the
faster the thesaurus construction.
In terms of saliency measure, when keeping
only the p most relevant contexts, sorting them
with PMI leads to much worse results than LMI
or frequency, as PMI gives too much weight to
infrequent combinations. This is consistent with
results of Biemann and Riedl (2013). Regarding
LMI versus frequency, the results using the latter
are slightly better (or with no significant differ-
ence, depending on the frequency range). The ad-
vantage of using frequency instead of LMI is that
it makes the process simpler and faster while lead-
ing to equal or better performance in all frequency
ranges. Therefore for the extrinsic evaluation us-
ing WBST task, we use frequency to select the
p most relevant contexts and then compute Lin’s
similarity using only those contexts.
Figure 3 shows the performance of the thesauri
in the WBST task in terms of precision, recall and

Filters based on LMI and PMI were also tested with the
texts occurring less than th times, but, this also
leads to poor recall, since many verbs are left out
of the thesauri and their WSBT questions cannot
be answered. On the other hand, keeping the most
relevant p contexts leads to more stable results and
when p is high (right plot), they are similar to those
shown in the left plot of Figure 3.
4.1 Discussion
The answer to our questions in Section 3 is yes,
more selective filters improve intrinsic and extrin-
sic thesaurus quality. The use of both filtering
methods results in thesauri in which the neighbors
of target verbs are closer in WordNet and get better
scores in TOEFL-like tests. However, the fact that
filtering contexts with frequency under th removes
verbs in the final thesaurus is a drawback, as high-
lighted in the extrinsic evaluation on the WBST
task.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that competitive
results can be obtained keeping only the p most
relevant contexts per verb. On the one hand, this
method leads to much more stable thesauri, with
the same verbs for all values of p. On the other
hand, it is important to highlight that the best re-
sults to assess the relevance of the contexts are ob-
tained using frequency while more sophisticated
filters such as LMI do not improve thesaurus qual-
ity. Although an LMI filter is relatively fast com-
pared to dimensionality reduction techniques such
as singular value decomposition (Landauer and
Dumais, 1997), it is still considerably more expen-
sive than a simple frequency filter.
In short, our experiments indicate that a reason-
same results as intrinsic evaluation: sorting contexts by fre-
quency leads to better results.
422
able trade-off between noise, coverage and com-
putational efficiency is obtained for p = 200 most
frequent contexts, as confirmed by intrinsic and
extrinsic evaluation. Frequency threshold th is
not recommended: it degrades recall because the
contexts for many verbs are not frequent enough.
This result is useful for extracting distributional
thesauri from very large corpora like the UKWaC
(Ferraresi et al., 2008) by proposing an alterna-
tive that minimizes the required computational re-
sources while efficiently removing a significant
amount of noise.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we addressed the impact of filters
on the quality of distributional thesauri, evaluat-
ing a set of standard thesauri and different filtering
methods. The results suggest that the use of fil-
ters and their parameters greatly affect the thesauri
generated. We show that it is better to use a filter
that selects the most relevant contexts for a verb
than to simply remove rare contexts. Furthermore,
the best performance was obtained with the sim-
plest method: frequency was found to be a simple
and inexpensive measure of context salience. This
is especially important when dealing with large
amounts of data, since computing LMI for all con-
texts would be computationally costly. With our
proposal to keep just the p most frequent contexts
per verb, a great deal of contexts are cheaply re-
moved and thus the computational power required
for assessing similarity is drastically reduced.
As future work, we plan to use these filters to
build thesauri from larger corpora. We would like
to generalize our findings to other syntactic con-
figurations (e.g. noun-adjective) as well as to other
similarity and informativeness measures. For in-
stance, ongoing experiments indicate that the same
parameters apply when Lin’s similarity is replaced
by cosine. Finally, we would like to compare the
proposed heuristics with more sophisticated filter-
ing strategies like singular value decomposition
(Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and non-negative
matrix factorization (Van de Cruys, 2009).
