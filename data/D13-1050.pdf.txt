Abstract 
This paper proposes a novel approach that uti-
lizes a machine learning method to improve 
pivot-based statistical machine translation 
(SMT). For language pairs with few bilingual 
data, a possible solution in pivot-based SMT 
using another language as a "bridge" to gen-
erate source-target translation. However, one 
of the weaknesses is that some useful source-
target translations cannot be generated if the 
corresponding source phrase and target phrase 
connect to different pivot phrases. To allevi-
ate the problem, we utilize Markov random 
walks to connect possible translation phrases 
between source and target language. Experi-
mental results on European Parliament data, 
spoken language data and web data show that 
our method leads to significant improvements 
on all the tasks over the baseline system. 
1 Introduction 
Statistical machine translation (SMT) uses bilin-
gual corpora to build translation models. The 
amount and the quality of the bilingual data 
strongly affect the performance of SMT systems. 
For resource-rich language pairs, such as Chinese-
English, it is easy to collect large amounts of bi-
lingual corpus. However, for resource-poor lan-
guage pairs, such as Chinese-Spanish, it is difficult 
to build a high-performance SMT system with the 
small scale bilingual data available.  
The pivot language approach, which performs 
translation through a third language, provides a 
possible solution to the problem. The triangulation 
method (Wu and Wang, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 
2007) is a representative work for pivot-based ma-
chine translation. With a triangulation pivot ap-
proach, a source-target phrase table can be 
obtained by combining the source-pivot phrase 
table and the pivot-target phrase table. However, 
one of the weaknesses is that some corresponding 
source and target phrase pairs cannot be generated, 
because they are connected to different pivot 
phrases (Cui et al., 2013). As illustrated in Figure 
1, since there is no direct translation between “?
?? henkekou” and “really delicious”, the trian-
gulation method is unable to establish a relation 
between “??? henkekou” and the two Spanish 
phrases. 
To solve this problem, we apply a Markov ran-
dom walk method to pivot-based SMT system. 
Random walk has been widely used. For example, 
Brin and Page (1998) used random walk to dis-
cover potential relations between queries and doc-
uments for link analysis in information retrieval. 
Analogous to link analysis, the aim of pivot-based 
translation is to discover potential translations be-
tween source and target language via the pivot 
language.  
524
The goal of this paper is to extend the previous 
triangulation approach by exploring implicit trans-
lation relations using random walk method. We 
evaluated our approach in several translation tasks, 
including translations between European lan-
guages; Chinese-Spanish spoken language transla-
tion and Chinese-Japanese translation with English 
as the pivot language. Experimental results show 
that our approach achieves significant improve-
ments over the conventional pivot-based method, 
triangulation method. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In section 2, we describe the related work. 
We review the triangulation method for pivot-
based machine translation in section 3. Section 4 
describes the random walk models. In section 5 
and section 6, we describe the experiments and 
analyze the performance, respectively. Section 7 
gives a conclusion of the paper. 
2 Related Work 
Several methods have been proposed for pivot-
based translation. Typically, they can be classified 
into 3 kinds of methods: 
Transfer Method: Within the transfer frame-
work (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wang et al., 
2008; Costa-jussà et al., 2011), a source sentence 
is first translated to n pivot sentences via a source-
pivot translation system, and then each pivot sen-
tence is translated to m target sentences via a piv-
ot-target translation system. At each step (source 
to pivot and pivot to target), multiple translation 
outputs will be generated, thus a minimum Bayes-
risk system combination method is often used to 
select the optimal sentence (González-Rubio et al., 
2011; Duh et al., 2011). A problem with the trans-
fer method is that it needs to decode twice. On one 
hand, the time cost is doubled; on the other hand, 
the translation error of the source-pivot translation 
system will be transferred to the pivot-target trans-
lation. 
Synthetic Method: A synthetic method creates 
a synthetic source-target corpus using source-pivot 
translation model or pivot-target translation model 
(Utiyama et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2009). For 
example, we can translate each pivot sentence in 
the pivot-target corpus to source language with a 
pivot-source model, and then combine the translat-
ed source sentence with the target sentence to ob-
tain a synthetic source-target corpus, and vice 
versa. However, it is difficult to build a high quali-
ty translation system with a corpus created by a 
machine translation system. 
Triangulation Method: The triangulation 
method obtains source-target model by combining 
source-pivot and pivot-target translation models 
(Wu and Wang, 2007; Cohn and Lapata 2007), 
which has been shown to work better than the oth-
er pivot approaches (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007). 
As we mentioned earlier, the weakness of triangu-
lation is that the corresponding source and target 
phrase pairs cannot be connected in the case that 
they connect to different pivot phrases. 
3 The Triangulation Method 
In this section, we review the triangulation method 
for pivot-based translation. 
With the two additional bilingual corpora, the 
source-pivot and pivot-target translation models 
can be trained. Thus, a pivot model can be ob-
tained by merging these two models. In the trans-
lation model, the phrase translation probability and 
the lexical weight are language dependent, which 
will be introduced in the next two sub-sections.

3.1 Phrase Translation Probability 
The triangulation method assumes that there exist 
translations between phrases s  and phrase p  in 
source and pivot languages, and between phrase 
p  and phrase t  in pivot and target languages. 
The phrase translation probability ?  between 
source and target languages is determined by the 
following model: 
( | ) ( | , ) ( | )
          ( | ) ( | )
p
p
s t s p t p t
s p p t
? ? ?
? ?
=
=
?
?
       (1) 
3.2 Lexical Weight 
Given a phrase pair ( , )s t and a word alignment 
a  between the source word positions 1, ,i n= ?  
and the target word positions 0,1, ,j m= ? , the 
lexical weight of phrase pair ( , )s t  can be calcu-
lated with the following formula (Koehn et al. 
2003) : 
( , )1
1
( | , ) ( | )
{ | ( , ) }
n
i j
i j ai
p s t a s t
j i j a?
?
? ?=
=
? ?? (2) 
In formula 2, the lexical translation probability 
distribution ( | )s t?  between source word s  and 
target word t  can be estimated with formula 3. 
'
'
( , )
( | )
( , )
s
count s t
s t
count s t
? =
?
            (3) 
Thus the alignment a  between the source 
phrase s  and target phrase t  via pivot phrase p  
is needed for computing the lexical weight. The 
alignment a  can be obtained as follows: 
1 2{( , ) | : ( , ) & ( , ) }a s t p s p a p t a= ? ? ?    (4) 
where 1a  and 2a  indicate the word alignment be-
tween the phrase pair ( , )s p  and ( , )p t , respec-
tively. 
The triangulation method requires that both the 
source and target phrases connect to the same piv-
ot phrase. Otherwise, the source-target phrase pair 
cannot be discovered. As a result, some useful 
translation relations will be lost. In order to allevi-
ate this problem, we propose a random walk model, 
to discover the implicit relations among the source, 
pivot and target phrases. 
4 Random Walks on Translation Graph 
For phrase-based SMT, all source-target phrase 
pairs are stored in a phrase table. In our random 
walk approach, we first build a translation graph 
according to the phrase table. A translation graph 
contains two types of nodes: source phrase and 
target phrase. A source phrase s  and a target 
phrase t  are connected if exists a phrase pair 
( , )s t  in the phrase table. The edge can be 
weighted according to translation probabilities or 
alignments in the phrase table. For the pivot-based 
translation, the translation graph can be derived 
from the source-pivot phrase table and pivot-target 
phrase table.  
Our random walk model is inspired by two 
works (Szummer and Jaakkola, 2002; Craswell 
and Szummer,2007). The general process of ran-
dom walk can be described as follows: 
Let ( , )G V E= be a directed graph with n  ver-
tices and m  edges. For a vertex v V? , ( )v?  de-
notes the set of neighbors of v  in G . A random 
walk on G  follows the following process: start at 
a vertex 0v , chose and walk along a random 
neighbor 1v , with 1 0( )v v?? . At the second step, 
start from 1v  and chose a random neighbor 2v , and 
so on. 
Let S be the set of source phrases, and P be the 
set of pivot phrases. Then the nodes V are the un-
ion of S and P. The edges E correspond to the rela-
tions between phrase pairs.  
Let R represent the binary relations between 
source phrases and pivot phrases. Then the 1-step 
translation ikR from node i to node k can be direct-
ly obtained in the phrase table. 
Define operator ?  to denote the calculation of 
relation R. Then 2-step translation ijR  from node i 
to node j can be obtained with the following for-
mula.  
ij ik kjR R R= ?                           (4) 
We use |0 ( | )tR k i  to denote a t-step translation 
relation from node i to node k. In order to calculate 
the translation relations efficiently, we use a ma-
trix A to represent the graph. A t step translation 
probability can be denoted with the following for-
mula. 
526
|0 ( | ) [ ]
t
t ikP k i A=                         (5) 
where A is a matrix whose i,k-th element is ikR . 
4.1 Framework of Random Walk Approach 
The overall framework of random walk for pivot-
based machine translation is shown in Figure 2. 
Before using random walk model, we have two 
phrase tables: source-pivot phrase table (SP phrase 
table) and pivot-target phrase table (PT phrase ta-
ble). After applying the random walk approach, we 
can achieve two extended phrase table: extended 
source-pivot phrase table (S’P’ phrase table) and 
extended pivot-target phrase table (P’T’ phrase 
table). The goal of pivot-based SMT is to get a 
source-target phrase table (ST phrase table) via SP 
phrase table and PT phrase table.  
Our random walk was applied on SP phrase ta-
ble or PT phrase table separately. In next 2 sub-
sections, we will explain how the phrase transla-
tion probabilities and lexical weight are obtained 
with random walk model on the phrase table. 
Figure 3 shows some possible decoding pro-
cesses of random walk based pivot approach. In 
figure 3-a, the possible source-target phrase pair 
can be obtained directly via a pivot phrase, so it 
does not need a random walk model. In figure 3-b 
and figure 3-c, one candidate source-target phrase 
pair can be obtained by random walks on source-
pivot side or pivot-target side. Figure 3-d shows 
that the possible source-target can only by ob-
tained by random walks on source-pivot side and 
pivot-target side. 
4.2 Phrase Translation Probabilities 
For the translation probabilities, the binary relation 
R is the translation probabilities in the phrase table. 
The operator ?  is multiplication. According to 
formula 5, the random walk sums up the probabili-
ties of all paths of length t between the node i and 
k. 
Figure 2: Framework of random walk based pivot translation. The ST phrase table was generated by combin-
ing SP and PT phrase table through triangulation method. The phrase table with superscript “’” means that it 
was enlarged by random walk.

For the 3 steps example, each step performs a 
translation process in the form of matrix’s self-
multiplication.  
1. The first step means the translation from 
source language to pivot language. The matrix 
A is derived from the phrase table directly and 
each element in the graph indicates a transla-
tion rule in the phrase table.  
2. The second step demonstrates a procedure: S-
P-S’. With 2 steps random walks, we can find 
the synonymous phrases, and this procedure is 
analogous to paraphrasing (Bannard and 
Callison-Burch, 2005). For the example shown 
in  figure 1 as an example, the hidden relation 
between “??? henkekou” and “????
feichanghaochi” can be found through Step 2. 
3. The third step describes the following proce-
dure: S-P-S’-P’. An extended source-pivot 
phrase table is generated by 3-step random 
walks. Compared with the initial phrase table 
in Step1, although the number of phrases is 
not increased, the relations between phrase 
pairs are increased and more translation rules 
can be obtained. Still for the example in Fig-
ure 1 , the hidden relation between “???
henkekou” and “really delicious” can be gen-
erated in Step 3. 
4.3 Lexical Weights 
To build a translation graph, the two sets of phrase 
translation probabilities are represented in the 
phrase tables. However, the two lexical weights 
are not presented in the graph directly. To deal 
with this, we should conduct a word alignment 
random walk model to obtain a new alignment a 
after t steps. For the computation of lexical 
weights, the relation R can be expressed as the 
word alignment in the phrase table. The operator 
?  can be induced with the following formula. 
1 2{( , ) | : ( , ) & ( , ) }a x y p x z a z y a= ? ? ?         (8) 
where a1 and a2 represent the word alignment 
information inside the phrase pairs ( , )x y  and 
( , )y z respectively. An example of word 
alignment inducing is shown in Figure 4. With a 
new word alignment, the two lexical weights can 
be calculated by formula 2 and formula 3.

5 Experiments 
5.1 Translation System and Evaluation Met-
ric 
In our experiments, the word alignment was ob-
tained by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) and the 
heuristics “grow-diag-final” refinement rule. 
(Koehn et al., 2003). Our translation system is an 
in-house phrase-based system using a log-linear 
framework including a phrase translation model, a 
language model, a lexicalized reordering model, a 
word penalty model and a phrase penalty model, 
which is analogous to Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). 
The baseline system is the triangulation method 
based pivot approach (Wu and Wang, 2007).  
To evaluate the translation quality, we used 
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as our evaluation 
metric. The statistical significance using 95% con-
fidence intervals were measured with paired boot-
strap resampling (Koehn, 2004). 
5.2 Experiments on Europarl 
5.2.1. Data sets 
We mainly test our approach on Europarl1
We perform our experiments on different trans-
lation directions and via different pivot languages. 
As a most widely used language in the world 
(Mydans, 2011), English was used as the pivot 
language for granted when carrying out experi-
ments on different translation directions. For trans-
lating Portuguese to Swedish, we also tried to 
perform our experiments via different pivot lan-
 corpus, 
which is a multi-lingual corpus including 21 Euro-
pean languages. Due to the size of the data, we 
only select 11 languages which were added to 
Europarl from 04/1996 or 01/1997, including Dan-
ish (da), German (de), Greek (el), English (en), 
Spanish (es), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Italian (it) 
Dutch (nl) Portuguese (pt) and Swedish (sv). In 
order to avoid a trilingual scenario, we split the 
training corpus into 2 parts by the year of the data: 
the data released in odd years were used for train-
ing source-pivot model and the data released in 
even years were used for training pivot-target 
model.

Several test sets have been released for the 
Europarl corpus. In our experiments, we used 
WMT20062, WMT20073 and WMT20084 as our 
test data. The original test data includes 4 lan-
guages and extended versions with 11 languages

Directions 
  
project. Table 3 shows the test sets. 
We build 180 pivot translation systems6
The baseline system was built following the tra-
ditional triangulation pivot approach. Table 4 lists 
the results on Europarl training data. Limited by 
 (including 
90 baseline systems and 90 random walk based 
systems) using 10 source/target languages and 1 
pivot language (English).

be build to cover the translation between each language.  
the length of the paper, we only show the results 
on WMT08, the tendency of the results on 
WMT06 and WMT07 is similar to WMT08. 
Several observations can be made from the table.  
1. In all 90 language pairs, our method achieves 
general improvements over the baseline system.  
2. Among 90 language pairs, random walk 
based approach is significantly better than the 
baseline system in 75 language pairs. 
3. The improvements of our approach are not 
equal in different translation directions. The im-
provement ranges from 0.06 (it-es) to 1.21 (pt-da). 
One possible reason is that the performance is re-
lated with the source and target language. For ex-
ample, when using Finnish as the target language, 
the improvement is significant over the baseline. 
This may be caused by the great divergence be-
tween Uralic language (Finnish) and Indo-
European language (the other European language 
in Table4). From the table we can find that the 
translation between languages in different lan-
guage family is worse than that in some language 
family. But our random walk approach can im-

prove the performance of translations between dif-
ferent language families. 
5.2.3. Experiments via Different Pivot Lan-
guages 
In addition to using English as the pivot language, 
we also try some other languages as the pivot 
language. In this sub-section, experiments were 
carried out from translating Portuguese to Swedish 
via different pivot languages.  
Table 5 summarizes the BLEU% scores of dif-
ferent pivot language when translating from Por-
tuguese to Swedish. Similar to Table 4, our 
approach still achieves general improvements over 
the baseline system even if the pivot language has 
been changed. From the table we can see that for 
most of the pivot language, the random walk based 
approach gains more than 1 BLEU score over the 
baseline. But when using Finnish as the pivot lan-
guage, the improvement is only 0.02 BLEU scores 
on WMT08. This phenomenon shows that the piv-
ot language can also influence the performance of 
random walk approach. One possible reason for 
the poor performance of using Finnish as the pivot 
language is that Finnish belongs to Uralic lan-
guage family, and the other languages belong to 
Indo-European family. The divergence between 
different language families led to a poor perfor-
mance. Thus how to select a best pivot language is 
our future work. 
The problem with random walk is that it will 
lead to a larger phrase table with noises. In this 
sub-section, a pre-pruning (before random walk) 
and a post-pruning (after random walk) method 
were introduced to deal with this problem.  
We used a naive pruning method which selects 
the top N phrase pairs in the phrase table. In our 
experiments, we set N to 20. For pre-pruning, we 
prune the SP phrase table and PT phrase table be-
fore applying random walks. Post-pruning means 
that we prune the ST phrase table after random 
walks. For the baseline system, we also apply a 
pruning method before combine the SP and PT 
phrase table. We test our pruning method on pt-en-
sv translation task. Table 6 shows the results. 
With a pre- and post-pruning method, the ran-
dom walk approach is able to achieve further im-
provements. Our approach achieved BLEU scores 
of 25.11, 24.69 and 24.34 on WMT06, WMT07 
and WMT08 respectively, which is much better 
than the baseline and the random walk approach 
with pruning.  Moreover, the size of the phrase 
table is about half of the no-pruning method. 
When adopting a post-pruning method, the per-
formance of translation did not improved signifi-
cantly over the pre-pruning, but the scale of the 
phrase table dropped to 69M, which is only about 
2 times larger than the triangulation method. 
Phrase table pruning is a key work to improve 
the performance of random walk. We plan to ex-
plore more approaches for phrase table pruning. 
E.g. using significance test (Johnson et al., 2007) 
or monolingual key phrases (He et al., 2009) to 
filter the phrase table.

5.3 Experiments on Spoken Language 
The European languages show various degrees of 
similarity to one another. In this sub-section, we 
consider translation from Chinese to Spanish with 
English as the pivot language. Chinese belongs to 
Sino-Tibetan Languages and English/Spanish be-
longs to Indo-European Languages, the gap be-
tween two languages is wide. 
A pivot task was included in IWSLT 2008 in 
which the participants need to translate Chinese to 
Spanish via English. A Chinese-English and an 
English-Spanish data were supplied to carry out 
the experiments. The entire training corpus was 
tokenized and lowercased. Table 7 and Table 8 
summarize the training data and test data. 
Table 9 shows the similar tendency with Table 4. 
The random walk models achieved BLEU% scores 
32.09, which achieved an absolute improvement of 
2.08 percentages points on BLEU over the base-
line.

5.4 Experiments on Web Data 
The setting with Europarl data is quite artificial as 
the training data for directly translating between 
source and target actually exists in the original 
data sets. The IWSLT data set is too small to rep-
resent the real scenario. Thus we try our experi-
ment on a more realistic scenario: translating from 
Chinese to Japanese via English with web crawled 
data. 
All the training data were crawled on the web. 
The scale of Chinese-English and English-
Japanese is 10 million respectively. The test set 
was built in house with 1,000 sentences and 4 ref-
erences.

Table10. Results on Web Data 
 
Table 10 lists the results on web data. From the 
table we can find that the random walk model can 
achieve an absolute improvement of 0.75 percent-
ages points on BLEU over the baseline.  
In this subsection, the training data contains 
parallel sentences with different domains. And the 
two training corpora (Chinese-English and Eng-
lish-Japanese) are typically very different. It 
means that our random walk approach is robust in 
the realistic scenario. 
6 Discussions 
The random walk approach mainly improves the 
performance of pivot translation in two aspects: 
reduces the OOVs and provides more hypothesis 
phrases for decoding.  
6.1 OOV 
Out-of-vocabulary (OOV 7
We count the OOVs when decoding with trian-
gulation model and random walk model on 
IWSLT2008 data. The statistics shows that when 
using triangulation model, there are 11% OOVs 
when using triangulation model, compared with 
9.6% when using random walk model. Less OOV 
often lead to a better result. 
) terms cause serious 
problems for machine translation systems (Zhang 
et al., 2005). The random walk model can reduce 
the OOVs. As illustrated in Figure 1, the Chinese 
phrase “???henkekou” cannot be connected to 
any Spanish phrase, thus it is a OOV term.  
                                                          
7 OOV refer to phrases here. 
532
6.2 Hypothesis Phrases 
To illustrate how the random walk method helps 
improve the performance of machine translation, 
we illustrate an example as follows: 
 
- Source: ? ? ? ?? 
              wo xiang yao zhentou 
- Baseline trans: Quiero almohada 
- Random Walk trans: Quiero una almohada 
 
For translating a Chinese sentence “?????
wo xiang yao zhentou” to Spanish, we can get two 
candidate translations. In this case, the random 
walk translation is better than the baseline system. 
The key phrase in this sentence is “?? zhentou”, 
figure 5 shows the extension process. In this case, 
the article “a” is hidden in the source-pivot phrase 
table. The same situation often occurs in articles 
and prepositions. Random walk is able to discover 
the hidden relations (hypothesis phrases) among 
source, pivot and target phrases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we proposed a random walk method 
to improve pivot-based statistical machine transla-
tion. The random walk method can find implicit 
relations between phrases in the source and target 
languages. Therefore, more source-target phrase 
pairs can be obtained than conventional pivot-
based method. Experimental results show that our 
method achieves significant improvements over 
the baseline on Europarl corpus, spoken language 
data and the web data.  
A critical problem in the approach is the noise 
that may bring in. In this paper, we used a simple 
filtering to reduce the noise. Although the filtering 
method is effective, other method may work better. 
In the future, we plan to explore more approaches 
for phrase table pruning.
