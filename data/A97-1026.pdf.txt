Abstract 
This paper describes a prceXype for automatically 
scoring College Board Advanced Placement (AP) 
Biology essays. I. The scoring technique used in 
this study was based on a previous method used to 
score sentence-length responses (Burstein, et al, 
1996). One hundred training essays were used to 
build an example-based lexicon and concept 
granunars. The prototype accesses information 
from the lexicon and concept grammars to score 
essays by assigning a classification ofExcellent or 
Poor based on the number of points assigned 
during scoring. Final computer-based ssay scores 
are based on the system's recognition of conceptual 
information i  the essays. Conceptual analysis in 
essays is essential to provide a classification based 
on the essay content. In addition, computer- 
generated information about essay content can be 
used to produce diagnostic feedback. The set of 
essays used in this study had been scored by human 
raters. The results reported in the paper show 94% 
agreement on exact or adjacent scores between 
human rater scores and computer-hased scores for 
105 test essays. The methods underlying this 
application could be used in a number of 
applications involving rapid semantic analysis of 
textual materials, especially with regard to 
scientific or other technical text.

Educational Testing Service (ETS) is currently 
developing computer-based scoring tools for 
automatic scoring of natural language constructed- 
responses - responses that are written, such as a 
short-answer o  an essay. The purpose of this work 
is to develop computer-based methods for scoring 
so that computer-administered natural language 
constructed-response it ms can be used on 
standardized tests and scored efficiently with 
regard to time and cost. 
Until recently, ETS's automated scoring efforts 
were primarily devoted to the development of 
computer programs used to score short-answer 
constructed-responses of up to 15 words (Burstein 
and Kaplan, 1995 and Burstein et al., 1996). In 
this study a classification of Excellent or Poor was 
automatically assigned to an AP Biology essay. 
Our initial goal in this study was to develop a 
prototype scoring system that could reliably assign 
a classification ofExcellent to a set of AP Biology 
essays. For the evaluation of the scoring method, 
a small sample of Poor essays were also scored to 
compare the results. 2
Human rater scoring of AP Biology essays is based 
on a highly constrained scoring key, called a 
rubric, that specifies the criteria human raters use 
to assign scores to essays. Accordingly, for the test 
question studied here, the criteria for point

classification. It was used in this study to 
distinguish t e Excellent essays with scores of 
9 and l0 from essays with lower end scores in the 
0 - 3 range. 
assignment are highly constrained. Essentially, the 
essay can be treated as a sequence of short-answer 
responses. Given our preliminary successes with 
test questions that elicit multiple responses from 
examinees, imilar scoring methods were applied 
for scoring AP Biology essay. The results show 
87% agreement for exact scores between human 
rater and computer scores, and 94% agreement for 
exact or adjacent scores between human rater and 
computer scores. 
This work is also applicable for other types of 
assessment as well, such as for employee training 
courses in corporate and government settings. 
Since the methods discussed in this paper describe 
techniques for analysis of semantic information i  
text, presumably this application could be extended 
to public informational settings, in which people 
might key in "requests for information" in a 
number of domains. In particular, these methods 
could be successfully applied to the analysis of 
natural language responses for highly constrained 
domains, such as exist in scientific or technical 
fields. 
SYSTEM TRAINING 
One hundred Excellent essays from the original 
200 essays were selected to train the scoring 
system. The original 200 essays were divided into a 
training set and test set, selected arbitrarily from 
the lowest examinee identification number. Only 
85 of the original 100 in the test set were included 
in the study due to illegibility, or use of diagrams 
instead of text to respond to the question. For 
convenience during training, and later, for scoring, 
essays were divided up by section, as specified in 
the scoring guide (see Figure 1), and stored in 
directories by essay section. Specifically, the Part 
A's of the essays were stored in a separate 
directory, as were Part B's, and Part C's. 
Examinees typically partitioned the essay into 
sections that corresponded tothe scoring uide. 
System training involved the following steps that 
are discussed in subsequent sections: a) manual 
lexicon development, b) automatic generation of 
concept-structure representation (CSR), c) manual 
creation of a computer-based rubric, d) manual 
CSR "fine-tuning", e) automatic rule generation, 
and f) evaluation of training process. 
Lexicon Development 
Example-based approaches to lexicon development 
have been shown to effectively exemplify word 
meaning within a domain (Richardson, et al., 
1993, and Tsutsumi 1992). It has been further 
pointed out by Wilks, et al, 1992, that word senses 
can be effectively captured on the basis of textual 
material, The lexic, on dw¢lopcd for this study used 
an example-based approach to compile a list of 
lexical items that characterized the content 
vocabulary used in the domain of the test question 
(i.e., gel electrophoresis). The lexicon is composed 
of words and terms from the relevant vocabulary of 
the essays used for training. 
To build the lexicon, all words and terms 
considered to contribute to the core meaning of 
each relevant sentence in an essay, were included 
in the lexicon. The decision with regard to 
whether or not a sentence was relevant was based 
on information provided in the scoring guide (in 
Figure 1). For instance, in the sentence, "Smaller 
DNA fragments mave faster than larger ones.", the 
terms Smaller, DNA, fragments, move, faster, 
larger are considered to be the most meaningful 
terms in the sentence. This is based on the criteria 
for a correct response for the Rate/Size category in 
the scoring guide. 
Each lexical entry contained a superordinate 
concept and an associated list of metonyms. 
Metonyms are words or terms which are acceptable 
substitutions for a given word or term (Gerstl, 
1991). Metonyms for concepts in the domain of 
this test question were selected from the example 
responses in the training data This paradigm was 
used to identify word similarity in the domain of 
the essays. For instance, the scoring program 
needed to recognize that sentences, uch as Smaller 
DNA fragments move faster than larger ones and 
The smaller segments of DNA will travel more 
quickly than the bi~.~er ones, contain alternate 
words with similar meanings in the test question 
domain. To determine alternate words with 
similar meanings, metonyms for words, such as 
fragments and move were established in the 
175 
lexicon so that the system could identify which 
words had similar meanings in the test item 
domain. The example lexical entries in (1) 
illustrate that the words fragment and segment are  
metonyms in this domain, as well as the words 
move and travel. In (1), FRAGMENT and MOVE 
are the higher level lexical concepts. The 
associated metonymsfor FRAGMENT and MOVE 
are in adjacent lists illustrated in (1). 
(1). Sample Lexical Entries 
wouM be digested only once, leaving 2 pieces.", 
and "The DNA fragment wouM only have 2 
segments," the phrases DATA segment and DNA 
fragment are paraphrases of each other, and 2 
pieces and 2 segments are paraphrases of each 
other. These sentences are represented bythe CSR 
in (2a) and in (2b). 
(2)a. NP: \[DNA,FRAGMENT\] 
NP: \[TWO,FRAGMENT\] 
FRAGMENT \[fragment particle segment...\] 
MOVE \[ move travel pass pull repel attract ...\] 
In the final version of the CSR, phrasal 
constituents are reduced to a general XP node, as is 
illustrated in 
Concept-Structure Representations (CSR) 
Obviously, no two essays will be identical, and it is 
unlikely that two sentences in two different essays 
will be worded exactly alike. Therefore, scoring 
systems must be able to recognize paraphrased 
information in sentences across essay responses.. 
To identify paraphrased information in sentences, 
the scoring system must be able to identify similar 
words in consistent syntactic patterns. As, 
Montemagni and Vanderwende (1993) have also 
pointed out, structural patterns are more desirable 
than string patterns for capturing semantic 
information from text. We have implemented a 
concept-extraction program for preprocessing of 
essay data that outputs conceptual information as it 
exists in the structure of a sentence. The program 
reads in a parse tree generated by MicrosoR's 
Natural Language Processing Tools (MSNLP) for 
each sentence in an essay) The program 
substitutes words in the parse tree with 
superordinate concepts from the lexicon, and 
extracts the phrasal nodes containing these 
concepts. (Words in the phrasal node which do not 
match a lexical concept are not included in the set 
of extracted phrasal nodes.) The resulting 
structures are CSRs. Each CSR represents a
sentence according to conceptual content and 
phra~l constituent structure. CSRs characterize 
paraphrased information in sentences. For 
example, in the sentences "The DNA segment 
(2)b..XP: \[DNA,FRAGMENT\] 
XP: ITWO,FRAGMENTI 
Since phrasal category does not have to be 
specified, the use of a generalized XP node 
minimizes the number of required lexical entries, 
as well as the number of concept grammar ules 
needed for the scoring process. 
The Computer Rubric 
Recall that a rubric is a scoring key. Rubric 
categories are the criteria that determine a correct 
response. A computer-based rubric was manually 
created for the purpose of classifying sentences in 
essays by rubric category during the automated 
scoring process. Computer ubric categories are 
created for the bulleted categories listed in the 
human rater scoring guide illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Scoring Guide Excerpt 
Accordingly, the computer-rubric categories were 
the following. For Part A, the categories were 
Electricity, Charge, Rate~size, Calibration, 
Resolution, and Apparatus. For Part B the 
categories were, Treatment I, Treatment 2, 
Treatment 3, and Treatment IV. For Part C1, the 
categories were: Recognition, Cutting, Alternate, 
and Detail Point. For Part C2, the categories were 
Change in l, Change in II, Alternate, and Detail 
Point. Each computer-rubric category exists as an 
electronic file and contains the related concept 
grammar ules used during the scoring process. 
The concept grammar rules are described later in 
the paper. 
Fine-Tuning CSRs 
CSRs were generated for all sentences in an essay. 
During training, the CSRs of relevant sentences 
from the training set were placed into computer- 
rubric category files. Relevant sentences in essays 
were sentences identified in the scoring guide as 
containing information relevant to a rubric 
category. For example, the representation for the 
sentence, "The DNA fragment would only have 2 
segments," was placed in the computer ubric 
category file for Treatment II.
Typically, CSRs are generated with extraneous 
concepts that do not contribute to the core meaning 
of the response. For the purpose of concept 
grammar rule generation, each CSR from the 
training data must contain only concepts which 
denote the core meaning of the sentence. 
Extraneous concepts had to be removed before the 
rule generation process, so that the concept- 
structure information i the concept grammar rules 
would be precise. 
The process of removing extraneous concepts from 
the CSRs is currently done manually. For this 
study, all concepts in the CSR that were considered 
to be extraneous to the core meaning of the 
sentence were removed by hand. For example, in 
the sentence, The DNA segment would be digested 
only once, leaving 2 pieces, the CSR in (3) was 
generated. For Treatment \]I, the scoring guide 
indicates that if the sentence makes a reference to 2 
fragments that it should receive one point. (The 
word, piece, is a metonym for the concept, 
fragment, so these two words may be used 
interchangably.) The CSR in (3) was generated by 
the concept-extraction program. The CSR in (4) 
(in which XP:\[DNA,FRAGMENT\] was removed) 
illustrates the fine-tuned version of the CSR in (3). 
The CSR in (4) was then used for the rule 
generation process, described in the next section. 
177 
(3) XP:\[DNA,FRAGMENT\] 
XP:\[TWO,FRAGMENT\] 
(4) XP:\[TWO,FRAGMENT\] 
Concept Grammar Rule Generation 
At this point in the process, each computer rubric 
categow is an electronic file which contains fine- 
tuned, CSRs. The CSRs in the computer rubric 
categories exemplify the information required to 
receive credit for a sentence in a response. We 
have developed a program that automatically 
generates rules from CSP.s by generating 
permutations of each CSR The example rules in 
(5) were generated from the CSR in (4). The rules 
in (5) were used during automated scoring 
(described in the following section). 
which looks for matches between CSRs and/or 
subsets of CSRs, and concept grammar ules in 
rubric categories associated with each essay part. 
Recall that CSRs often have extraneous concepts 
that do not contribute to the core meaning of the 
sentence. Therefore, the scoring program looks for 
matches between concept grammar rules and 
subsets of CSRs, if no direct match can be found 
for the complete set of concepts in a CSR. The 
scoring program assigns points to an essay as rule 
matches are found, according to the scoring guide 
(see Figure 1). A total number of points is 
assigned to the essay after the program has looked 
at all sentences in an essay. Essays receiving a 
total of at least 9 points are classified as Excellent, 
essays with 3 points or less are classified as Poor, 
and essays with 4 - 8 points are classified as "Not 
Excellent." The example output in Appendix 1 
illustrates matches found between sentences in the 
essay and the rubric rules from an Excellent essay. 
(5)a. XP:\[TWO, FRAGMENT\] 
b. XP:\[FRAGMENT,TWO\] 
The trade-off or generating rules automatically in 
this manner is rule overgeneration, but this does 
not appear to be problematic for the automated 
scoring process. Automated rule generation is 
significantly faster and more accurate than writing 
the rules by hand. We estimate that it would have 
taken two people about two weeks of full-time 
work to manually create the rules. Inevitably, 
there would have been typographical errors and 
other kinds of "human error". It takes 
approximately 3 minutes to automatically generate 
the rules. 
AUTOMATED SCORING 
The 85 remaining Excellent test essays and a set of 
20 Poor essays used in this study were scored. 
First, all sentences in Parts A, B and C of each 
essay were parsed using MSNLP. Next, 
inflectional suffixes were automatically removed 
from the words in the parsed sentences, since 
inflectional suffixed forms are not included in the 
lexicon. CSRs were automatically generated for all 
sentences in each essay. For each part of the essay, 
the scoring program uses a searching algorithm 
RESULTS 
Table 1 shows the results of using the automatic 
scoring prototype to score 85 Excellent test essays, 
and 20 Poor test essays. Coverage (Cov) illustrates 
how many essays were assigned a score. Accuracy 
(Acc) indicates percentage of agreement between 
the computer-based score and the human rater 
score. Accuracy within 1 (w/i 1) or 2 points (w/i 2) 
shows the amount of agreement between the 
computer scores and human raters cores, within 1 
or 2 points of human rater scores, respectively. For 
Excellent essays computer-based scores would be 1 
or 2 points below the 9 point minimum, and for 
Poor essays, they would be 1 or 2 points above the 
3 point maximum.

ERROR ANALYSIS 
An error analysis of the data indicated the 
following two error categories that reflected a 
methodological problem: a) Lexicon Deficiency 
and b) Concept Grammar Rule Deficiency. These 
error categories are discussed briefly below. Both 
error types could be resolved in future research. 
Scoring errors can be linked to data entry errors, 
morphological stripping errors, parser errors, and 
erroneous rules generated ue to misinterpretations 
of the scoring guide. These errors, however, are 
peripheral to the underlying methods applied in 
this study. 
Lexical Deficiency 
Recall that the lexicon in this study was built from 
relevant vocabulary in the set of 100 training 
essays. Therefore, vocabulary which occurs in the 
test data, but not in the training data was ignored 
during the process of concept-extraction. This 
yielded incomplete CSRs, and degraded scoring 
resulted. For instance, while the core concept of 
the commonly occurring phrase one band is more 
often than not expressed as one band, or one 
fragment, other equivalent expressions existed in 
the test data some of which did not occur in the 
training data. From our 185 essays we extracted 
possible substitutions of the term one fragment. 
These are: one spot, one band, one inclusive line, 
one probe, one group, one bond, one segment, one 
length o f  nucleotides, one marking, one strand, 
one solid clump, in one piece, one bar, one mass, 
one stripe, one bar, and one blot. An even larger 
sample of essays could contain more alternate word 
or phrase substitutions than those are listed here. 
Perhaps, increased coverage for the test data can be 
achieved ff additional standard ictionary sources 
are used to create a lexicon, in conjunction with 
the example based method used in this study 
(Richardson et al., 1993). Corpus-based techniques 
using domain-specific texts (e.g., Biology 
textbooks) might also be helpful (Church and 
Hanks, 1990). 
Concept Grammar Rule Deficiency 
In our error analysis, we found cases in which 
information in a test essay was expressed in a 
novel way that is not represented in the set of 
concept grammar ules. In these cases, essay 
scores were degraded. For example, the sentence, 
"The action o f  this mutation would nullify the 
effect o f  the site, so the enzyme Y would not affect 
the site o f  the mutation. " is expressed uniquely, as 
compared to its paraphrases in the training set. 
This response says in a somewhat roundabout way 
that due to the mutation, the enzyme will not 
recognize the site and will not cut the DNA at this 
point. No rule was found to match the CSR 
generated for this test response. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
This prototype scoring system for AP Biology 
essays uccessfully scored the Excellent and Poor 
essays with 87% exact agreement with human 
grader scores. For the same set of essays, there 
was 94% agreement between the computer scores 
and human rater scores for exact or adjacent 
scores. The preprocessing steps required for 
automated scoring are mostly automated. Manual 
processes, such as lexicon development could be 
automated in the future using standard context- 
based, word distribution methods (Smadja, 1993), 
or other corpus-based techniques. The error 
analysis from this study suggests that dictionary- 
based methods, combined with our current 
example-based approach, might effectively help to 
expand the lexicon). Such methods could broaden 
the lexicon and reduce the dependencies on 
training data vocabulary. The automation of the 
fine-tuned CSRs will require more research. A 
fully automated process would be optimal with 
regard to time and cost savings. Work at the 
discourse level will have to be done to deal with 
more sophisticated responses which are currently 
treated as falling outside of the norm. 
Perhaps the most attractive feature of this system 
in a testing environment is that it is defensible. 
The representation used in the system denotes the 
content of essay responses based on lexical 
meanings and their relationship to syntactic 
structure. The computer-based scores reflect the 
computer-based analysis of the response content, 
and how it compares to the scoring guide 
developed by human experts. Information 
generated by the system which denotes response 
179 
content can be used to generate useful diagnostic 
feedback to examinees. 
Since our methods explicitly analyze the content of 
text, these or similar methods could be applied in a 
variety of testing, training or information retrieval 
tasks. For instance, these natural language 
processing techniques could be used for World 
Wide Web-based queries, especially with regard to 
scientific subject matter or other material 
producing constrained natural language t xt.
