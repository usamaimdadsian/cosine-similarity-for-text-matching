Abstract
This paper presents an exploratory data
analysis in lexical acquisition for adjec-
tive classes using clustering techniques.
From a theoretical point of view, this
approach provides large-scale empiri-
cal evidence for a sound classification.
From a computational point of view, it
helps develop a reliable automatic sub-
classification method.
Results show that the features used in
theoretical work can be successfully
modelled in terms of shallow cues. The
resulting clusters parallel to a large ex-
tent with proposals in the literature,
which indicates that automatic acquisi-
tion of adjective classes for large-scale
lexicons is possible.
1 Introduction
This paper reports on experiments applying clus-
tering techniques to explore the behaviour of Cata-
lan adjectives in running text. The objectives of
the exploratory data analysis were twofold: from
a theoretical point of view, to get large-scale em-
pirical insight in order to develop a sound classi-
fication; and from a practical perspective, to test
whether the features mentioned in the literature
could be successfully modelled in terms of shal-
low cues, which would allow an automatic classi-
fication.
A sound classification of adjectives should al-
low one to predict morphological, syntactic and
semantic properties of particular items. This pre-
dictive power can be exploited in several NLP
tasks (see Section 3).
Bootstrapping techniques have been recently
applied to German adjective class acquisition
(Bohnet et al., 2002). In contrast, we have taken an
unsupervised approach in order to test the classes
proposed in the literature and investigate their
properties (see Section 2). Clustering is suitable
for linguistic investigation in classification tasks
(Pereira et al., 1993), and has been specially ap-
plied in the lexical domain, where no consensus
on classification criteria has been reached yet (see
Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002) and Merlo
and Stevenson (2001) on verb classes and Hatzi-
vassiloglou and McKeown (1993) on adjectival
scales). Clustering can be used as an exploratory
technique that provides insight into the organiza-
tion of such domains, by finding classes of ho-
mogeneous objects and the features that crucially
characterise them.
The initial hypothesis was a three-way classifi-
cation based on proposals in the literature (Section
2). Features discussed in theoretical work were
modelled in terms of shallow cues (Section 4) and
a series of clustering experiments were performed
over more than 3500 lemmata from a tagged cor-
pus (Section 5). The results obtained support the
initial hypothesis, with caveats (Section 6).
2 Catalan Adjective Classes
After a review of the literature on adjective clas-
sification (Hamann, 1991; Bouillon and Viegas,
1999; Demonte, 1999; Picallo, 2002), a three-way
9
classification was tested, similar to the ones estab-
lished in resources such as MikroKosmos (Raskin
and Nirenburg, 1995) and WordNet (Miller, 1998)
for several Indoeuropean languages. These three
classes can be roughly characterised as follows
(terms follow Picallo (2002) and Kamp (1975) for
nonpredicatives):
Qualitative adjectives (drunk, serious, rich)
• syntax: they occur as predicates in copu-
lar sentences (my taylor is rich) and in pred-
icative constructions (I saw her drunk). In
Catalan, they usually appear after the nomi-
nal head but can occasionally appear before.
• semantics: they are gradable and compara-
ble: richer, more serious, very drunk. Grad-
ability can be observed in Catalan (in ad-
dition to adverbial modification) in regular
derivational degree and diminutive suffixes,
such as -1ssim (petit: little, petitissim: very
little).
• denotation: they are said to denote attributes
or properties of their referents.
Relational adjectives (thoracic, neurological)
• morphology: they are usually morphologi-
cally complex, either denominal or deverbal:
thoracic, from thorax.
• syntax: they only appear as attributes of cop-
ular verbs under constrained conditions: *the
evolution of the patient is neurological, but
the problem of the patient is neurological. In
Catalan, they cannot occur before the nomi-
nal head.
• semantics: they are neither gradable nor
comparable.
• denotation: they relate the referent of the
noun to an external entity (Demonte, 1999).
Nonpredicative adjectives (mere, alleged)
• syntax: in Catalan, nonpredicative adjectives
only appear before the nominal head and can-
not occur as predicates in copular sentences.
• semantics: they are nongradable and non-
comparable.
• denotation: they do not denote properties
but properties of properties, so they are non-
intersective (Hamann, 1991).
In addition to the differences explained so far,
there is a major syntactic argument for adopt-
ing this classification: adjectives belonging to the
same class coordinate when modifying the same
noun, but adjectives from different classes do not:
*A serious and neurological problem vs. a serious
neurological problem, *A mere and rich taylor vs.
a mere rich taylor. When co-occuring, relational
adjectives are always nearer to the nominal head
than qualitative ones, and qualitative nearer than
nonpredicative ones.
3 Adjective classification: motivation
and challenges
Identifying adjective subclasses is useful for sev-
eral tasks in NLP, at different levels of linguistic
description. For example, in Catalan, if an ad-
jective is qualitative, it can bear a regular grade
morpheme (issim), so this information can help
broaden the morphological coverage of computa-
tional lexicons. As for syntax, coordination and
adjective order can be exploited to disambiguate
lexical items which are ambiguous between noun
and adjective, one of the most pervasive ambigui-
ties in POS-tagging for many Romance languages.
Finally, class information could help predict and
detect potential shifts in meaning.
However, it is very difficult to establish a sharp
line between the classes proposed. Adjective clas-
sification, being a matter involving lexical seman-
tics, is hampered by polysemy. The main problem
in this case is class-associated polysemy: many
adjectives exhibit mixed behaviour between qual-
itative and nonpredicative, on the one hand, or re-
lational and qualitative, on the other.
As an example of the qualitative-nonpredicative
polysemy, take an adjective such as English poor.
It has at least two meanings associated to differ-
ent classes: poor man means 'not rich' (qualitative
reading) and 'pitiable' (nonpredicative reading).
The difference can be observed when translated
into Catalan: the usual translation of poor is pobre,
but when used as qualitative it will follow the noun
(home pobre) and when used as a nonpredicative

it will precede it (pobre home). As for relational-
qualitative polysemy, Catalan económic has two
meanings which can be translated as economic (re-
lational) and cheap (qualitative), so that econamic
can modify a noun like pantalons trousers').
Both kinds of polysemy are regular (Apresjan,
1974); moreover, we believe that all relational ad-
jectives could be potentially used as qualitative,
and all qualitative adjectives could eventually de-
velop a nonpredicative use. Why posit different
classes, then?
There are at least two answers to that question.
One the one hand, not all adjectives actually have
readings corresponding to both classes. For in-
stance, it is difficult to find an appropriate context
where thoracic can be used as qualitative.
On the other hand, as discussed in Section 2,
each class presents a different set of linguistic
properties. Therefore, even those adjectives which
are ambiguous exhibit the properties of one sin-
gle class in each particular context. For instance,
as nonpredicatives cannot be used in copular sen-
tences, poor is unambiguously qualitative in such
contexts: the man is poor is not synonymous
with the man is pitiable. Conversely, econômic
is gradable when used as qualitative: pantalons
molt economics ('very cheap trousers'). It is there-
fore useful to draw a distinction between the three
classes, even if a particular adjective does not nec-
essarily belong to one single class.
4 Modelling the Data
4.1 Corpus and tools
The corpus used was a fragment of CTILC (Cor-
pus Textual Informatitzat de la Llengua Cata-
lana), collected by the Institute for Catalan Studies
(IEC). The fragment contains 8.5 million words of
Catalan written texts from 1970 onwards, belong-
ing to a formal register.
The corpus had previously been automatically
tagged and hand-corrected, with information on
lemma, part-of-speech and other morphological
information (following the EAGLES standard). It
was additionally parsed with CATCG, a shallow
parser for Catalan developed at GLICOM (Alsina
et al., 2002). This shallow parser provides each
word with a tag indicating its syntactic funcion
(main verb, subject, etc.).
In order to minimise problems due to data
sparseness, only adjectives occuring more than 10
times in the corpus were taken into account, to-
talling 3522 adjective lemmata.
4.2 Shallow cues
The features used to model the adjectives were
features detectable in the annotated text itself
with no external knowledge sources, because we
wanted to model the linguistic behaviour of adjec-
tives using no previous lexical knowledge. There-
fore, information on derivational morphology was
not used at this stage (but it was for analysis; see
Section 5.3).
The values for each feature were set as true per-
centages, that is, the number of times a feature is
detected for a given adjective, divided by the num-
ber of occurrences of that adjective in the corpus.
The lemmata were modelled using features of
two kinds. On the one hand, shallow textual cor-
relates were defined for some of the parameters
discussed in Section 2. Table l lists these theoret-
ically motivated features, together with their mean
and standard deviation values, as well as the shal-
low cues that were defined as textual correlates of
the features.
On the other hand, and in order to test the
11

• number of clusters: 2 to 7 for each dataset, to
find the most informative granularity level
5.2 Attribute Sets
strengths and weaknesses of the starting hypoth-
esis, a relatively unbiased description of adjetives
was also provided: each lemma was described
by distributional features, the POS of a five-word
window (two at each side), as seen in Table 2.

word -2 Det 0.39 0.20

word -2 Prep 0.13 0.09
Table 2: Distributional features used for describing adjec-
tives for clustering. Of the 36 features, only the 10 with high-
est standard deviation are shown here.
It can be argued that some theoretically moti-
vated features, like comparability or gradability,
should not be modelled with percentages, because
they do not convey relative properties, but rather
absolute ones. However, by assigning these fea-
tures percentages we hope to distinguish adjec-
tives belonging to more than one class from unam-
biguous ones. It is reasonable to hypothesise that
ambiguous adjectives will have different values
in these features than unambiguous ones, which
might yield differences in clustering results.
5 Experiments
5.1 Clustering Parameters
A number of clustering experiments were carried
out using CLUTO (Karypis, 2002). CLUTO is
a stand-alone clustering tool that provides infor-
mation for analysing the characteristics of the ob-
tained clusters, by means of a list of descriptive
and discriminating features of each cluster.
The clustering parameters of CLUTO were held
constant throughout the whole set of experiments,
so as to focus on the effects of variations in the fea-
tures used, that is, in the description of the objects.
The clustering parameters used were:
• clustering algorithm: partitioning, based on
the clustering criterion H2, a combination
of cluster-internal similarity and inter-cluster
dissimilarity (Zhao and Karypis, 2002)
The 3522 adjectives were clustered with three dif-
ferent subsets of the features described in Section
4.2: distributional features, textual correlates of
theoretically motivated features, and both distri-
butional and theoretically motivated.
After a series of experiments, the following dis-
tributional attributes were found to perturb classi-
fication and were left out of adjective description:
• word -2 is determiner and word -1 is noun
present a very high correlation coefficient
(0.8), which strengthens their discriminating
power. Since they characterise the default
adjectival context in Catalan, solutions using
these features group more than half of the ad-
jectives in one cluster. If not used, less dis-
criminating features yield finer distinctions.
• followed by preposition and word +2 is de-
terminer are very discriminating features, but
they distinguish adjectives by their subcate-
gorisation behaviour, which is not related to
the targeted classification.
• followed by punctuation is also very discrim-
inating, but the classes characterised by this
feature are meaningless.
5.3 Analysis Procedure
Of the six clustering solutions obtained for the
three approaches, ranging from 2 to 7 clusters, 5-
cluster solutions were studied in detail, because
they presented the best joint values for cluster
quality (see Figure 1).
Due to the high number of objects that were
clustered, the qualitative analysis of the obtained
solutions was problematic. Since a comprehen-
sive hand-made judgement of the solutions was
almost impossible, two alternative strategies were
adopted: a comparison of the distribution of adjec-
tive classes in clusters with a classification built by
human judges and with a morphology-based clas-
sification; and a cluster-internal analysis via ex-
amination of their characterising features and the
objects that prototypically represent them.

Figure 1: Quality of 2- to 7-cluster solutions with theoret-
ically motivated features, measured by average cluster inter-
nal similarity, cluster tightness (internal similarity divided by
standard deviation) and distinguishibility (internal similarity
divided by external similarity).
In order to analyse the distribution of adjec-
tive classes in clusters, two a-priori classifications
were built. First, 4 human judges classified a
subset of 102 adjectives. 100 adjectives were
randomly chosen, and two nonpredicatives (mer
'mere' and presumpte ' alleged'), were included so
that this class, not found by random selection, was
also represented. Judges assigned each of the ad-
jectives to one of the hypothesised classes (Sec-
tion 2): nonpredicative, qualitative or relational,
or to two additional classes in order to account
for polysemy: ambiguous between nonpredicative
and qualitative or ambiguous between qualitative
and relational.
The kappa measure for agreement between
judges ranged from 0.52 to 0.64, with a confidence
interval at 95% of +1-0.14. According to Landis
and Koch, (1977) these figures indicate moderate
(< 0.61) to substantial (> 0.61) agreement, but
Carletta (1996) considers that values below 0.67
are too low to be significant for linguistic tasks.
The agreement among judges is thus relatively
poor, which is a clear indicator of the difficulty
of the task. In spite of that, a consensus classifica-
tion of the subset was established as a comparison
ground for clustering solutions.
However, this evaluation only considered 2% of
the objects in the dataset. To avoid low represen-
tativity, a large-scale classification was performed
using derivational morphology. Some derivational
suffixes yield either qualitative or relational ad-
jectives: for instance, the denominal suffix Os,
roughly denoting 'bearing N' and thus a kind of
property, forms qualitative adjectives such as ver-
gonyas ('shy', from vergonya, 'shyness').
Adjectives formed by derivational processes
were classified according to the suffix they bear,
using a list of 54 adjective forming suffixes de-
tected by pattern matching. Morphologically sim-
ple adjectives and very ambiguous suffixes, as
far as adjective classes are concerned, were not
classified. No information could be gathered for
nonpredicative adjectives, because there are no
nonpredicative-forming suffixes.
With this procedure, 2132 adjectives (59% of
the whole set) were classified. In spite of the
fact that pattern matching is very error prone, and
that morphological processes are not fully regular,
this classification shows general tendencies for the
distribution of relational and qualitative adjectives
across clusters, as shown by the kappa coefficient
with the manually annotated set (0.45, close to the
lowest agreement between human judges, 0.52).
Figure 2 shows the distribution of adjectives
across clusters in the approaches with distribu-
tional and with theoretically motivated attributes.
As a second analysis strategy, the characteris-
tics of the clusters as such were explored, based on
the list of features that CLUTO provides as most
descriptive for the resulting clusters (see Section
5.1). Moreover, cluster centroids were also exam-
ined in order to obtain an example-based, human-
friendly idea of the content of the clusters. An
adjective was considered a centroid for a cluster
when its values for descriptive features were very
close to the mean value of that feature within the
cluster. A summary is presented in Table 3.
6 Results and discussion
As can be seen in Figure 2, results in both ap-
proaches coincide to a large extent, with a kappa
coefficient of 0.45. Kappa agreement was calcu-
lated between equivalent clusters for every pair of
solutions, considering that cluster equivalence cor-
responded to sharing a majority of objects.
High statistical correlation coefficients were
found between some theoretically motivated fea-
tures and some distributional ones, as can be seen
in Table 4.
This correlation is motivated by the fact that the
theoretically motivated features are represented in
terms of distributional properties. Remarkably,
though, from the 31 distributional features used,

cally motivated features and some distributional ones.
those ellicited as most discriminating by cluster-
ing coincide to a large extent with those that are
most highly correlated with the theoretically mo-
tivated features. This provides empirical support
for the theoretically motivated features chosen for
the experiments.
Table 3 shows the most discriminating features
for each of the clusters in the three approaches.
In both approaches there are two clusters contain-
ing mainly relational adjectives and three contain-
ing mainly qualitatives. Also, the two nonpredica-
tive adjectives are grouped together, but in a clus-
ter also containing many qualitatives. The features
used are not discriminating enough to differentiate
nonpredicative adjectives from qualitative ones.
As for polysemous adjectives, they are scattered
through all the clusters also in both approaches.
A possible explanation for that is polysemous ad-
jectives do not present a homogeneous behaviour:
ambiguous adjectives such as irônic 'ironic' are
used more as qualitatives than as relationals, and
are clustered accordingly together with qualita-
fives. The reverse is true for adjectives such as
alemany ' German'.
Three sets of clusters containing qualitative ad-
jectives are consistently distinguished in the three
solutions, which in Table 3 bear the labels grad-
able, attributive and non-intersective. Focusing
on theoretical features, the first cluster is charac-
terized by gradability and comparativity, the sec-
ond one by attributivity and predicativity, and the
third one by non-intersectivity. This variation
seems to indicate that qualitative adjectives do not
have an homogeneous behaviour.
However, it has to be taken into account that the
three clusters are described in the solutions pro-
vided by CLUTO by the same descriptive features,
only with different discriminating strength in the
different clusters. It can be concluded, then, that
qualitatives are not distinguished categorically, but
gradually.
As for relationals, in the solution using theo-
retically motivated features they are characterised
positively by positional features. In the distribu-
tional approach, however, they are defined almost
negatively, as lacking all of the features that de-
scribe the other clusters. The lack of any strong,
distinctive feature for these groups of adjectives
can be explained by the fact that relationals are

The label in the last column summarizes the main characteristic of the clusters across solutions.
distributionally unmarked in Catalan (recall that
the attributes representing the default context were
not used; see Section 5.2).
In the solution using theoretically motivated
features, cluster first adj. is characterised by oc-
curring in the first position when combined with
other adjectives. As suggested by the discussion
in Section 2, relationals occur closer to the noun
than qualitatives, so this result is consistent with
the initial hypothesis.
Surprisingly, though, cluster last adj. also con-
tains mainly relational adjectives, even though it
has as main characteristic the fact that the adjec-
tives occur in the last position when combined
with other adjectives. This cluster contains many
nationality-denoting adjectives, which have been
classified as relational or ambiguous between re-
lational and qualitative in the manually annotated
corpus. When co-occurring with other relational
adjectives, they appear further from the nominal
head: English empiricist philosopher. This solu-
tion, thus, indicates that a finer-grained classifica-
tion might be needed for relational adjectives.
Since theoretically motivated and distributional
features provide comparable solutions, the combi-
nation of the two should strengthen the tendencies
already noted when used separately. Indeed, when
adjectives are described by the union of these two
sets of features, clusters are more neatly defined,
as can be seen in Figure 3. The distribution of
clusters is totally comparable to the one sketched
above. As for the features describing the clus-
ters, theoretically motivated features combine with
the corresponding distributional ones as expected
from the discussion so far (see Table 3).

retically motivated features, compared to classifications ob-
tained by human judges (upper row) and using derivational

7 Conclusions and Further Work
Clustering has proven to be a successful method
for linguistic investigation in a relatively unex-
plored area such as adjectival classification. Re-
sults show that the features used in theoretical
work can be successfully modelled in terms of
15
shallow cues, so that automatic acquisition of ad-
jective classes is possible for large-scale lexicons.
Results using distributional features parallel to a
large extent with results using theoretically moti-
vated features, which provides empirical evidence
that the properties mentioned in Section 2 are rel-
evant for adjective classification. Moreover, clus-
tering results largely support the initial hypothe-
sis, as qualitative adjectives are distinguished from
relational ones and nonpredicative adjectives are
grouped together.
Nevertheless, this approach is not useful for de-
tecting and acquiring data on class-associated pol-
ysemy, probably due to heterogeneity in the be-
haviour of polysemous adjectives. Several alterna-
tives will be explored in the near future: soft clus-
tering can be used to test whether polysemous ad-
jectives fall into several clusters; also, a bootstrap-
ping approach has been envisaged that exploits in-
formation on coordination and adjective order.
