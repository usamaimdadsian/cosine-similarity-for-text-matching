Michael Alexander Kirkwood Halliday has been actively analyzing and documenting 
the interactions between syntax and semantics for over forty years, and his systemic- 
functional theory has been a foundation for important work in computational linguis- 
tics for at least thirty years. The first major application of systemic theory was the 
SHRDLU system by Winograd (1972). The largest ongoing series of applications has 
been developed at the USC Information Sciences Institute: language generation (Mann 
1982; Hovy 1988); discourse analysis and rhetorical structure (Mann and Thompson 
1992); and the interface between the lexicon and world knowledge (Bateman et al. 
1990; Matthiessen 1995). 
In this book, Halliday and Matthiessen present a comprehensive survey of seman- 
tics and its relationships to syntax and cognition. Although they present their subject 
from a systemic-functional point of view, they show how their approach is related 
to a wide range of work in both computational nd theoretical linguistics. One no- 
table omission from their 23-page bibliography is Noam Chomsky, whose period of 
active research almost exactly coincides with Halliday's. They do, however, give a fair 
summary of semantic theories based on Chomsky's approach, ranging from the early 
work of Katz and Fodor to the more recent work by Jackendoff. 
The book consists of 15 chapters organized in five parts. In Part I, the authors 
contrast the systemic approach with a view of knowledge representation as a "piece- 
meal accumulation" of concepts with "no overall organization." Instead of treating 
language "as a kind of code in which pre-existing conceptual structures are more or 
less distortedly expressed," they view language as a semiotic system that serves "as 
the foundation of human experience." The goal of systemic theory is to present a 
comprehensive iew of how humans construe xperience through language. Unlike 
Chomsky, they do not consider grammar as "autonomous" but as an integral part of 
the lexicogrammar, which realizes meaning in words, phrases, sentences, and para- 
graphs. 
Part II, comprising Chapters 2 through 7, presents the meaning base, which cor- 
responds to what many authors would call an ontology. The meaning base, however, 
represents categories of experience with a topmost node called phenomenon i stead 
of categories of existence with a topmost node called entity. The first subdivision of 
phenomena is a three-way partitioning according to levels of complexity: 
. Elementary ideas or elements are realized by the lexicogrammar s
words or short groups of words, such as rain, from the west, or 8 
hard-boiled eggs. Computationally, elements may be represented by slots 
in a frame, nodes in a graph, or typed variables in logic.

. 
Configurations of elements or figures are realized by phrases or clauses, 
such as rain ending from the west or chop finely. Computationally, a figure 
may be represented by various data structures, uch as a frame, list, or 
graph. 
Complexes of figures or sequences are realized by complex sentences or 
paragraphs, uch as Take 8 hard-boiled eggs, chop finely, mash with 3 
tablespoons ofsoft butter, and add salt and pepper. Computationally, a 
sequence could be represented by a network of frames, a list of lists, a 
graph of graphs, or structures of objects in an object-oriented language. 
Each of these categories is further divided and subdivided by various distinctions, 
some dyadic and some triadic. Elements are classified as participant, circumstance, or
process. Figures are classified by another triad of relational (being or having), material 
(doing or happening), and mental (sensing or saying). These categories are further 
elaborated and illustrated with numerous examples. To demonstrate he generality of 
the approach, Chapter 7 shows how the semantic ategories realized in English can 
also be realized in Chinese and other languages. 
Part III consists of two chapters that show how the theory can be implemented 
in a computational system for language generation, with examples of weather eports 
and cooking recipes. Part IV consists of three chapters that compare the theoretical 
and descriptive techniques of systemic-functional theory to other approaches. The 
concluding Part V consists of three chapters that apply systemic theory to an analysis 
of how humans construe xperience through language. Chapter 14 has an intriguing 
analysis of the evolution of linguistic expressions from folk theories to scientific theo- 
ries. Instead of drawing a sharp dichotomy between commonsense and scientific ways 
of thinking, the authors how how the basic linguistic mechanisms of abstraction and 
metaphor are used to systematize and formalize scientific language. Metaphor is fun- 
damental to both science and poetry. The primary difference is that poets constantly 
strive to create novel metaphors, while scientists recycle, perfect, and build on the 
most successful of their colleagues' metaphors. 
In summary, this book makes a strong case for the systemic approach as a fruitful 
alternative to Chomsky's view of autonomous syntax. The authors demonstrate that 
semantics has important structures that are cross-linguistic and formalizable. Although 
they present heir data with the terminology, notation, and viewpoint of the systemic- 
functional approach, their analyses, distinctions, and categories can be adapted to 
semantic theories based on other approaches. 
The authors criticize the logic-based, model-theoretic approaches for their limited 
ontologies and neglect of important aspects of language, such as metaphor. Yet logi- 
cians recognize the need for richer ontologies, and many, if not most, would agree that 
semantics i  the proper starting point for a study of natural anguage. The authors try 
to draw a sharp distinction between the deductive methods of logic and the method 
of inheritance used in frame-based systems. A logician, however, would reply that 
inheritance is the oldest of all rules of inference; it was introduced by Aristotle for 
syllogisms, and it is a derived rule in every modern system of logic. The methods of 
unification used in many logic-based systems implement inheritance in ways that are 
equivalent to or more general than frame systems. Rather than being a competitor, the 
systemic approach can be a valuable complement to the logic-based approaches. 
The authors consider language as a semiotic system, but they only mention the 
dyadic version of semiotics developed by Saussure and linguists influenced by Saus- 
sure, such as Hjelmslev and Firth. Peirce analyzed the sign relation in greater depth 
141 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 1 
than Saussure and emphasized its irreducible triadic nature. Although Halliday and 
Mattheissen never mention Peirce, they have rediscovered many of Peirce's triads in 
their systemic analysis (Peirce 1991-1998). Their choice of phenomenon as the most 
general category is an unconscious endorsement of Peirce's point that his categories 
were primarily phenomenological r ther than ontological. The systemic triad of being- 
having, doing-happening, and sensing-saying corresponds to Peirce's fundamental 
triad of Quality, Reaction, and Representation. Most of the other triads in the systemic 
meaning base also have a strong Peircean flavor, and a more conscious application of 
Peirce's version of semiotics might help clarify and refine many of the triadic distinc- 
tions in the systemic approach. 
Perhaps the least attractive feature of the book is its formatting. The authors used 
a conventional word processor to print camera-ready copy on A4 paper, which the 
publisher eproduced without change. The result is a heavy, unwieldy tome with a 
great deal of wasted paper, a generally unfinished appearance, but a price tag of $102. 
With that price and format, the book is destined to sell very few copies, the authors 
will get little or nothing in royalties, the publisher's high price will seem to be justified, 
and a potentially important book will never be read by students who might profit from 
it. The book would get better distribution if the authors had simply put the electronic 
version on their Web site; better yet, professional societies uch as the ACL should put 
books such as these on their Web sites.

Manipulating meanings of natural anguage texts and utterances i one of the main 
objectives of any large-scale NLP system. However, at present here is no general 
theory that explains what natural language meanings precisely are, and how they 
are to be effectively computed for purposes of practical NLP. Moreover, in the first 
place there is not even an overall agreement as to a general notion of "meaning" 
that is computationally relevant. Two prominent approaches to the question can be 
recognized. 
. 
. 
The machine learning approach: In this view, meanings hould be 
defined according to whatever epresentation practical NLP systems find 
useful. For instance, if a system is to extract ravel information from free 
text, then meanings in this context can be defined as records in a 
database containing fields such as "destination", time of arrival", 
"means of transportation", etc. Such a representation has to be defined 
ad hoc for any relevant purpose, but the mapping from natural anguage 
to this formal representation is performed automatically using general 
learning algorithms. 
The formal semantics approach: According to this line, meanings are 
logical objects and should be manipulated using logical tools. Work in 
the formal-semantic s hool that developed from Montague grammar 
specifies the logically relevant parts of meaning and how to derive them 
from a natural anguage input, while the field of computational 
semantics deals with the algorithmic realization of these formal 
techniques as NLP systems. 
The volume under review is a collection of 16 articles that adopt the second view 
as their starting point. In a clear and instructive introduction, the editors present an 
overview of the formal approach to the computation of meaning, illustrate it using a 
small calculus, and discuss a number of general problems for this approach. Of special 
importance is the ambiguity problem: the spurious multiplicity of meanings that even 
the most sophisticated syntactic and semantic theories derive. The construction of 
underspecified representations of meaning, which is one of the prominent echniques

for tackling the ambiguity problem, is addressed from different angles by five of the 
articles in the volume. Another prominent issue in computational semantics is the 
dynamic nature of many natural language phenomena, especially those related to 
anaphora nd presupposition. Six articles in this volume address dynamic semantics 
from different perspectives. The other articles in the book deal with different opics 
in semantics: compositionality, speech events, belief utterances, motion verbs, and the 
interpretation of German compounds. 
These topics are vast and highly varied, and a fair description of even the core 
ideas in these papers is impossible within the space limits of this review. (A good 
overview of the articles in this volume can be found in the introduction.) Many of 
the works have important implications for formal semantics or theoretical linguistics, 
but those papers that are most relevant for computational linguistics are those that 
succeed in extending an existing computational framework to treat phenomena that 
it had not previously handled. One such contribution is the paper by Richter and 
Sailer, who develop an underspecified semantics in HPSG. Of similar significance is 
an interesting paper by Van Genabith and Crouch, who give a semantics of cross- 
sentential anaphora using LFG glue language semantics. Other papers would be of 
interest mainly to theoretical linguists or to logicians and philosophers of language. 
Good examples of works of the first kind are a paper by Ginzburg on ellipsis resolution 
and a paper by Stone and Hardt on the anaphoric properties of modals. Examples of 
more logically oriented papers are the contribution by Meyer Viol et al. on the use 
of epsilon terms for underspecified semantics and the paper by Asher and Fernando 
on underspecification using labeled representations. Although these works do not 
give algorithmic implementations of their ideas, they include enough formal details 
to make small but illustrative computer applications feasible. The book also contains 
two articles of a more programmatic nature: on underspecified semantics (by Pinkal) 
and on compositionality and minimum description length (by Zadrozny). These works 
and others would be of interest o any researcher occupied with problems of natural 
language semantics from a formal or computational perspective. 
It is also important o make clear what the book does not include: 
 It does not provide a unified framework. To understand many of the 
proposals in this book, the reader has to become familiar with a 
considerable number of notations, techniques, and theoretical 
standpoints, ometimes with no real justification for this variety. 
 The book does not contain contributions that would be of direct 
relevance to the NLP engineer who is especially interested in the 
development of practical "real-world" applications. 
In general, the editors did a good job in projecting a collection of works repre- 
senting the state of the art in computational semantics. The book contains material 
that will be of value especially to experts in this field. However, most of the papers in 
the volume will also be relevant o researchers from other branches of computational 
linguistics who are interested in theoretical aspects of the computation of meaning in 
natural anguage.
