Abstract
Previous methods for extracting attributes
(e.g., capital, population) of classes (Em-
pires) from Web documents or search
queries assume that relevant attributes oc-
cur verbatim in the source text. The ex-
tracted attributes are short phrases that
correspond to quantifiable properties of
various instances (ottoman empire, ro-
man empire, mughal empire) of the class.
This paper explores the extraction of non-
contiguous class attributes (manner (it)
claimed legitimacy of rule), from fact-
seeking and explanation-seeking queries.
The attributes cover properties that are
not always likely to be extracted as short
phrases from inherently-noisy queries.
1 Introduction
Motivation: Resources such as Wikipedia (Remy,
2002) and Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) aim
at organizing knowledge around classes (Food in-
gredients, Astronomical objects, Religions) and
their instances (wheat flower, uranus, hinduism).
Due to inherent limitations associated with main-
taining and expanding human-curated resources,
their content may be incomplete. For example,
attributes representing the energy (or energy per
100g) or solubility in water are available in both
Wikipedia and Freebase for many instances of
Food ingredients (e.g., for olive oil, honey, fennel).
But the attributes are missing for some instances
(e.g., cornmeal). Moreover, structured informa-
tion about how long (it) lasts unopened or manner
(it) helps in weight loss is generally missing for
Food ingredients, from both resources. Such in-
formation is also often absent from among the at-
tributes acquired from either documents or queries
by previous extraction methods (Pas¸ca et al., 2007;
Van Durme et al., 2008). Previously extracted at-
tributes tend to be short, often nominal, phrases
like nutritional value and taste. Even when ex-
tracted attributes are not nominal (Pas¸ca, 2012),
they remain relatively short phrases such as good
for skin. As such, previous attributes have limited
ability to capture the finer-grained properties be-
ing asked about in queries such as “how long does
olive oil last unopened” and “how does honey help
in weight loss”. The presence of such queries
suggests that such information is relevant to Web
users. Identifying noncontiguous properties, or
attributes of interest to Web users, helps filling
some of the gaps in existing knowledge resources,
which otherwise could not be filled by attributes
extracted with previous methods.
Contributions: The contributions of this paper
are twofold. First, it introduces a method for the
acquisition of noncontiguous class attributes, from
fact or explanation-seeking Web search queries
like “how long does olive oil last unopened” or
“how does honey help in weight loss”. The re-
sulting attributes are more diverse than, and there-
fore subsume, the scope of attributes extracted
by previous methods. Indeed, previous meth-
ods are unlikely to extract attributes as specific
as length/duration (it) lasts unopened and man-
ner (it) helps in weight loss, for the instances olive
oil and honey of the class Food ingredients. Con-
versely, previously extracted attributes like nutri-
tional value and solubility in water are roughly
equivalent to the finer-grained nutritional value
(it) has and reason (it) dissolves in water, ex-
tracted from the queries “what nutritional value
does honey have” and “why does glucose dissolve
in water” respectively. Second, the noncontiguous
attributes can be simultaneously interpreted as bi-
nary relations pertaining to instances and classes.
The relations (helps in weight loss) connect an in-
stance (honey) or, more generally, a class (Food
ingredients), on one hand; and a loosely-typed un-
known argument (manner) whose value is of in-
terest to Web users, on the other hand. Because
386
Web users already inquire about the value of one
of their arguments, the extracted relations are more
likely to be relevant for the respective instances
and classes, than relations extracted from arbitrary
document sentences (Fader et al., 2011).
2 Noncontiguous Attributes
Intuitions: Users tend to formulate their Web
search queries based on knowledge that they al-
ready possess at the time of the search (Pas¸ca,
2007). Therefore, search queries play two roles
simultaneously: in addition to requesting new in-
formation, they indirectly convey knowledge in
the process. In particular, attributes correspond
to quantifiable properties of instances and their
classes. The extraction of attributes from queries
starts from the intuition that, if an attribute A is rel-
evant for a class C, then users are likely to ask for
the value of the attribute A, for various instances
I of the class C. If nutritional value and diameter
are relevant attributes of the classes Food ingre-
dients and Astronomical objects respectively, it is
likely that users submit queries to inquire about
the values of the attributes for instances of the
two classes. Such queries could take the form
“what is the (nutritional value)
A
of (olive oil)
I
”
and “what is the (diameter)
A
of (jupiter)
I
”; or
the more compact “(nutritional value)
A
of (olive
oil)
I
” and “(diameter)
A
of (jupiter)
I
”. In this
case, the attributes are relatively short phrases
(nutritional value, diameter), and are expected to
appear as contiguous phrases within queries. Pre-
vious methods on attribute extraction from queries
specifically target this type of attributes. In fact,
some methods apply dedicated extraction patterns
(e.g., A of I) over either queries (Pas¸ca et al.,
2007) or documents (Tokunaga et al., 2005). Other
methods expand manually-provided seed sets of
attributes, with other phrases that co-occur with
instances within queries, in similar contexts as the
seed attributes do (Pas¸ca, 2007).
While simpler properties are often mentioned in
queries as short, contiguous phrases, finer-grained
properties often are not. Queries seeking the rea-
son for solidification for some Food ingredients
could, but rarely do, contain the attribute ver-
batim (“what is the reason for the solidification
of honey”). Instead, queries are more likely to
inquire about the expected value, while specify-
ing the instance and the properties encoded by
the attribute (“(why)
A
does (honey)
I
(solidify)
A
”).
Readable descriptions (names) of the attributes
can be recovered from the queries, by assembling
the type of the expected value and the proper-
ties together (reason (it) solidifies). Thus, fact
and explanation-seeking queries are an intriguing
source of noncontiguous attributes that are not re-
stricted to short phrases, and are not required to
occur as contiguous phrases in queries.
Acquisition from Queries: The extraction
method proposed in this paper takes as input a set
of target classes, each of which is available as a
set of instances that belong to the class; and a set
of anonymized queries independent from one an-
other. As illustrated in Figure 1, the method se-
lects queries that contain an instance of a class
together with what is deemed to be likely a non-
contiguous attribute, and outputs ranked lists of
attributes for each class. The extraction consists
in several stages:
• selection of a subset of queries that contain
an instance in a form that suggests the queries ask
for the value of a noncontiguous attribute of the
instance;
• extraction of noncontiguous attributes, from
query fragments that describe the property of in-
terest and the type of its expected value;
• aggregation and ranking of attributes of in-
dividual instances of a class, into attributes of a
class.
Extraction Patterns: In order to determine
whether a query contains an attribute of a class,
the query is matched against the extraction pat-
terns from Table 1. The use of patterns in attribute
extraction has been previously suggested in (Pas¸ca
et al., 2007; Tokunaga et al., 2005), where the pat-
tern what is the A of I extracts noun-phrase A
attributes of instances I from queries and docu-
ments. In our case, the patterns are constructed
such that they match fact-seeking and explanation-
seeking questions that likely inquire about the
value of a relevant property of an instance I of the
class C. For example, the first pattern from Ta-
ble 1 matches queries such as “when did everquest
become free to play” and “when was radon dis-
covered as an element”, which inquire about the
date or time when certain events affected certain
properties of the instances everquest and radon re-
spectively. Instances I of the class C may be avail-
able as non-disambiguated items, that is, as strings
(java) whose meaning is otherwise unknown; or
as disambiguated items, that is, as strings associ-

Figure 1: Overview of extraction of noncontiguous attributes from Web search queries
ated with pointers to knowledge base entries with a
disambiguated meaning (Java (programming lan-
guage)). In the first case, the matching of a query
fragment, on one hand, to the portion of an ex-
traction pattern corresponding to an instance I , on
the other hand, consists in simple string match-
ing. In the second case, the matching requires
that the disambiguation of the query fragment, in
the context of the query, matches the desired dis-
ambiguated meaning of I from the pattern. The
subset of queries matching any of the extraction
patterns, for any instances I of a class C, are the
queries that contribute to extracting noncontigu-
ous attributes of the class C.
Collecting Attributes of Individual Instances:
A small set of rules optionally converts wh-
prefixes into coarse-grained types of the expected
values (e.g., how long into length/duration; or
when into date/time). In the case of what-prefixed
queries, the adjacent noun phrase, if any, is con-
sidered to be the expected type (“what nutritional
value ..” into nutritional value). Similar rules
have been employed for shallow analysis of open-
domain questions (Dumais et al., 2002). The pred-
icate verbs in the remainder of the query are up-
dated, to match the tense specified by the auxil-
iary verb (e.g., “when did ..”), if any, following
the wh-prefix. Thus, the verb come is converted
to the past tense came, in the case of the query
“when did minecraft come out for xbox 360”. An

Table 1: The extraction patterns match queries that
are likely to inquire about the value of a noncon-
tiguous attribute of an instance (I=a required in-
stance; A=a required non-empty sequence of arbi-
trary tokens)
attribute is constructed from the concatenation of
the wh-prefix or expected type (date/time); the
slot pronoun it, in lieu of the instance (date/time
(it)); and the query remainder after tense conver-
sion (date/time (it) came out for xbox 360). If the
linking verb following the wh-prefix is a form of
be (e.g., was), then the linking verb is also re-
tained after the slot pronoun, to form a more co-
herent attribute (date/time (it) was first released).
Since constructed attributes are noun phrases, they
are more consistent with, and can be more eas-
ily inserted among, existing attributes in struc-
tured data repositories (infobox entries of articles
in Wikipedia, or property names or topics in Free-
base).
Aggregation into Class Attributes: Attributes of
a class C are aggregated from attributes of indi-
vidual instances I of the class. An attribute A
is deemed more relevant for C if the attribute is
extracted for more of the instances I of the class
C, and for fewer instances I that do not belong to
the class C. Concretely, the score of an attribute
for a class is the lower bound of the Wilson score
interval (Brown et al., 2001) where the number
of positive observations is the number of queries
for which the attribute A is extracted for some in-
stance I in the class C, |{Query(I, A)}
I?C
|; and
the number of negative observations is the num-
ber of queries for which the attribute A is ex-
tracted for some instances I outside of the class
C, |{Query(I, A)}
I /?C
|. The scores are internally
computed at 95% confidence. Attributes of each
class are ranked in decreasing order of their scores.
Reduction of Near-Duplicate Attributes: Due to
lexical variations across queries from which at-
tributes are extracted, some of the attributes are
equivalent or nearly equivalent to one another. For
example, gained independence, won its indepen-
dence and gained its freedom of the class Coun-
tries are roughly equivalent, although they employ
distinct tokens. The diversity and potential useful-
ness of a ranked list of attributes can be increased,
if groups of near-duplicate attributes are identified
in the list, and merged together.
A lower-ranked attribute is marked as a near-
duplicate of a higher-ranked (i.e., earlier) attribute
from the list, if all tokens from the lower-ranked
attribute match either tokens from the higher-
ranked attribute (gained independence vs. won
its independence), or tokens from synonyms of
phrases from the earlier attribute (gained indepen-
dence vs. won its independence; or takes to show
symptoms vs. takes to come out). Stop words,
which include linking verbs, pronouns, determin-
ers, conjunctions, wh-prefixes and prepositions,
are not required to match. Synonyms may be ei-
ther derived from existing lexical resources (e.g.,
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)), or mined from large
document collections (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).
Lower-ranked near-duplicate attributes are merged
with the higher-ranked ones from the ranked list,
thus improving the diversity of the list.
3 Experimental Setting
Textual Data Sources: The experiments rely
on a random sample of around 1 billion fully-
anonymized queries in English, submitted to a
general-purpose Web search engine. Each query
is available independently from other queries, and
is accompanied by its frequency of occurrence in
the query logs.
Target Classes: Table 2 shows the set of 40 tar-
get classes for evaluating the attributes extracted
from queries. In an effort to reuse experimental
setup proposed in previous work, each of the 40
manually-compiled classes introduced in (Pas¸ca,
2007) is mapped into the Wikipedia category that
best matches it. For example, the evaluation
classes Aircraft Model, Movie, Religion and Ter-
389

Actors (keanu reeves, milla jovovich, ben affleck), Air-
craft (boeing 737, bombardier crj200, embraer 170), An-
imated characters (bugs bunny, pink panther (character),
yosemite sam), Association football clubs (a.s. roma, flu-
minense football club, real madrid), Astronomical objects
(alpha centauri, jupiter, delta corvi), Automobiles (nis-
san gt-r, tesla model s, toyota prius), Awards (grammy
award, justin winsor prize (library), palme d’or), Battles
and operations of world war ii (battle of midway, opera-
tion postmaster, battle of milne bay), Chemical elements
(plutonium, radon, hydrogen), Cities (rio de janeiro, os-
aka, chiang mai), Companies (best buy, aveeno, pep-
sico), Countries (costa rica, rwanda, south korea), Cur-
rencies by country (japanese yen, swiss franc, korean
won), Digital cameras (canon eos 400d, nikon d3000,
pentax k10d), Diseases and disorders (anorexia nervosa,
hyperlysinemia, repetitive strain injury), Drugs (flutica-
sone propionate, phentermine, tramadol), Empires (ot-
toman empire, roman empire, mughal empire), Films (the
fifth element, mockingbird don’t sing, ten thousand years
older), Flowers (trachelospermum jasminoides, lavandula
stoechas, evergreen rose), Food ingredients (carrot, olive
oil, fennel), Holidays (good friday, easter, halloween),
Hurricanes in North America (hurricane katrina, hurri-
cane wilma, hurricane dennis), Internet search engines
(google, baidu, lycos), Mobile phones (nokia n900, htc
desire, samsung s5560), Mountains (mount rainier, cerro
san luis obispo, steel peak), National Basketball Associa-
tion teams (los angeles lakers, cleveland cavaliers, indiana
pacers), National parks (yosemite national park, orang na-
tional park, tortuguero national park), Newspapers (the
economist, corriere del trentino, seattle medium), Organi-
zations designated as terrorist (taliban, shining path, eta),
Painters (claude monet, domingo antonio velasco, tarci-
sio merati), Programming languages (javascript, prolog,
obliq), Religious faiths traditions and movements (con-
fucianism, fudoki, omnism), Rivers (danube, pingo river,
viehmoorgraben), Skyscrapers (taipei 101, 15 penn plaza,
eqt plaza), Sports events (tour de france, 1984 scottish cup
final, rotlewi versus rubinstein), Stadiums (fenway park,
chengdu longquanyi, stade geoffroy-guichard), Treaties
(treaty of versailles, franco-indian alliance, treaty of cor-
doba), Universities and colleges (cornell university, nu-
gaal university, gale college), Video games (minecraft,
league of legends, everquest), Wine (madeira wine, yel-
low tail (wine), port wine)
Table 2: Set of 40 Wikipedia categories used as
target classes in the evaluation of attributes
roristGroup from (Pas¸ca, 2007) are mapped into
the Wikipedia categories Aircraft, Films, Religious
faiths traditions and movements and Organiza-
tions designated as terrorist respectively. The
name of the Wikipedia category only serves as a
convenience label for its target class, and is not
otherwise exploited in any way during the evalua-
tion. Instead, a target class consists in a set of titles
of Wikipedia articles, of which sample titles (e.g.,
the Wikipedia article titled nissan gt-r) are shown
in lowercase for each class (e.g., Automobiles) in
Table 2. The set of instances of a class is selected
from all articles listed under the respective cate-
Label Examples of Attributes
vital Astronomical objects: manner (it) generates its
energy
Food ingredients: temperature (it) solidifies
Religion: date/time (it) became a religion
okay Astronomical objects: manner (it) became a
constellation
Food ingredients: reason (it) sparks in the mi-
crowave
Religion: manner (it) feels about abortion
wrong Astronomical objects: reason (it) has arms
Food ingredients: manner (it) cleans pennies
Religion: who owns (it)
Table 3: Correctness labels manually assigned to
attributes extracted for various classes
gory in Wikipedia, or listed under sub-categories
of the respective category.
The target classes contain between 41 (for Na-
tional Basketball Association teams) and 66,934
(for Films) instances, with an average of 10,730
instances per class.
Synonym Repository: A synonym repository ex-
tracted separately from Web documents contains
mappings from each of around 60,000 phrases in
English, to lists of their synonym phrases. For ex-
ample, the top synonyms available for the phrases
turn off and contagious are [switch off, extinguish,
turn out, ..] and [infectious, catching, communica-
ble, ..] respectively.
Parameter Settings: Queries that match any of
the extraction patterns from Table 1 are syntac-
tically parsed (Petrov et al., 2010). As a pre-
requisite, the portion I of the patterns from the
table must match a disambiguated instance from
a query.
A variation of the tagger introduced
in (Cucerzan, 2007) maps query fragments
to their disambiguated, corresponding Wikipedia
instances (i.e., to Wikipedia articles). The tagger
is simplified to select the longest instance men-
tions, and does not use gazetteers or queries for
training. Depending on the sources of textual
data available for training, any taggers (Cucerzan,
2007; Ratinov et al., 2011; Pantel et al., 2012) that
disambiguate text fragments relative to Wikipedia
entries can be employed.
4 Evaluation Results
Attribute Accuracy: The top 50 attributes, from
the ranked lists extracted for each target class, are
manually assigned correctness labels. As shown in
Table 3, an attribute is marked as vital, if it must
be present among representative attributes of the
390

Programming languages 31 7 12 0.69

Table 4: Accuracy of top 50 class attributes ex-
tracted from fact-seeking and explanation-seeking
queries, over the evaluation set of 40 target classes
class; okay, if it provides useful but non-essential
information; and wrong, if it is incorrect (Pas¸ca,
2007). For example, the attributes manner (it) gen-
erates its energy, manner (it) became a constella-
tion and reason (it) has arms are annotated as vital,
okay and wrong respectively for the class Astro-
nomical objects. To compute the precision score
over a set of attributes, the correctness labels are
converted to numeric values: vital to 1.0, okay to
0.5, and wrong to 0.0. Precision is the sum of the
correctness values of the attributes, divided by the
number of attributes.
Table 4 summarizes the precision scores over
the evaluation set of target classes. The scores
vary from one class to another, for example 0.71
for Food ingredients but 0.94 for Chemical el-
ements. The average score is 0.76, indicating
that attributes extracted from fact and explanation-
seeking queries have encouraging levels of accu-
racy. The results already take into account the
detection of near-duplicate attributes. More pre-
cisely, the highest-ranked attribute in each group
of near-duplicate attributes, examples of which are
shown in Table 5, is retained and evaluated; the
lower-ranked attributes from each group are not
considered in the evaluation. Attributes like num-
ber of passengers (it) can hold, number of pas-
sengers it fits and number of passengers it seats
are nearly equivalent, but are still not marked as
near-duplicates for the class Aircraft, when they
should. Conversely, the attribute location (it)
lives is marked as a near-duplicate of location (it)
lives in new york, when it should not. Never-
theless, a significant number of near-duplicates,
which would otherwise crowd the ranked lists of
attributes with redundant information, are identi-
fied and discarded.
Target Class: Group of Near-Duplicate Attributes
Actors: movies (it) plays in, played in, acts in, acted in,
played, played on
Automobiles: date (it) was first manufactured, first pro-
duced, first made
Battles and operations of World War II: reason (it) hap-
pened, took place, occurred
Chemical elements: manner (it) returns to the atmo-
sphere, gets back into the atmosphere, got into the atmo-
sphere, gets into the atmosphere, enters the environment,
enters the atmosphere
Companies: location (it) makes its products, manufac-
tures its products, produces its products, gets its products,
makes its products, manufactures their products
Companies: date/time (it) began outsourcing, started out-
sourcing, outsourced
Countries: date (it) got its independence, gained indepen-
dence, gained its independence, got independence, got
their independence, won its independence, achieved inde-
pendence, received its independence, gained its freedom
Diseases and disorders: length/duration (it) takes to show
symptoms, takes to show up, takes to show, takes to ap-
pear, takes to manifest, takes to come out

tified for various classes. Attributes within a group
are ranked according to their individual scores.
Removing all but the first attribute of each group,
from the ranked list of attributes of the respective
class, improves the diversity of the list
Discussion: The set of patterns shown in Table 1
is extensible. Moreover, the patterns are subject
to errors. They may cause false matches, resulting
in erroneous extractions. The extent to which this
occurs is indirectly measured in the overall preci-
sion results. The modification of some of the pat-
terns, or the addition of new ones, would likely af-
fect the expected coverage and precision of the ex-
tracted attributes. If a pattern is particularly noisy,
it is likely to cause systematic errors, and therefore
produce attributes of lower quality.
Since attributes in Wikipedia and Freebase are
initially entered manually by human editors, their
correctness is virtually guaranteed. As for at-
tributes extracted automatically, previous compar-
isons indicate that attributes tend to have higher
quality when extracted from queries instead of
documents (Pas¸ca, 2007). Indeed, a set of
extraction patterns applied to text produces at-
tributes whose average precision at rank 50 is 0.44
when extracted from documents, vs. 0.63 from
queries (Pas¸ca et al., 2007). More importantly,
previously available or extracted attributes are vir-
tually always simple, short noun phrases like nu-
tritional value, taste or solubility in water. Even if
not confined to noun phrases, they are still short,

Table 6: Top relations extracted for a sample of
target classes via open-domain relations from doc-
uments (D) or via attributes from queries (Q)
like vegan, healthy or gluten free (Van Durme et
al., 2008; Pas¸ca, 2012). In comparison, attributes
extracted in this paper accommodate properties
that are sometimes awkward or even impossible
to express through short phrases.
Noncontiguous Attributes as Relations: Non-
contiguous attributes extracted from fact-seeking
queries are embodiments of relations linking the
instances mentioned in the queries, on one hand,
and the values being requested by the queries, on
the other hand. Therefore, the method proposed in
this paper can also be regarded as a method for the
acquisition of relevant relations of various classes.
The extracted relations specify the left argument
(i.e., the instance) and the linking relation name
(i.e., the attribute). They only specify the type
of the, but not the actual, right argument (i.e., the
value being requested).
An additional experiment compares the accu-
racy of relations extracted as noncontiguous at-
tributes from queries, vs. relations extracted by a
previous open-domain method (Fader et al., 2011)
from 500 million Web documents. The previous
method, including its extraction patterns and its
ranking scheme, is designed with instances rather
than classes in mind. For fairness to the method
in (Fader et al., 2011), the evaluation procedure
is slightly adjusted. The set of instances associ-
ated with each target class, over which the two
methods are evaluated, is reduced to a single repre-
sentative instance selected a-priori. The instances
are shown as the first instances in parentheses for
each class in the earlier Table 2. Thus, the class
attributes are extracted using only the instances
keanu reeves, boeing 737 and bugs bunny in the
case of the classes Actors, Aircraft and Animated
characters respectively.
Table 6 suggests that noncontiguous attributes
extracted from queries tend to capture higher-
quality relations than arbitrary relations extracted
from documents. Because fact-seeking queries in-
quire about the value of some relations (attributes)
of an instance, the relations themselves tends to
be more relevant than relations extracted from ar-
bitrary document sentences. Nevertheless, rela-
tions derived from queries likely serve as a useful
complement, rather than replacement, of relations
from documents. The former only discover what
relations may be relevant; the latter also identify
their occurrences within text.
5 Related Work
Sources of text from which relations (Zhu et
al., 2009; Carlson et al., 2010; Lao et al.,
2011) and, more specifically, attributes can be
extracted include Web documents and data in
human-compiled encyclopedia. In Web docu-
ments, attributes are available within unstruc-
tured (Tokunaga et al., 2005; Pas¸ca et al., 2007),
structured (Raju et al., 2008) and semi-structured
text (Yoshinaga and Torisawa, 2007), layout for-
matting tags (Wong et al., 2008), itemized lists or
tables (Cafarella et al., 2008). In human-compiled
encyclopedia (Wu and Weld, 2010), data relevant
to attribute extraction includes infoboxes and cat-
egory labels (Nastase and Strube, 2008; Hoffart
et al., 2013) associated with Wikipedia articles.
In order to acquire class attributes, a common
strategy is to first acquire attributes of instances,
then aggregate or propagate (Talukdar and Pereira,
392
2010) attributes, from instances to the classes to
which the instances belong. The role of Web
search queries, as an alternative textual data source
to Web documents in open-domain information
extraction, has been investigated in the tasks of at-
tribute extraction (Pas¸ca, 2007; Pas¸ca, 2012), as
well as in collecting sets of related instances (Jain
and Pennacchiotti, 2010).
To increase diversity within a ranked list of at-
tributes, the extraction method in this paper em-
ploys a synonym vocabulary to approximately
identify groups of near-duplicate attributes. As
reported for previous methods, the resulting lists
may still contain lexically different but semanti-
cally equivalent attributes. Scenarios where de-
tecting all equivalent attributes is important may
benefit from other techniques for paraphrase ac-
quisition (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).
Sophisticated techniques are sometimes em-
ployed to identify the type of the expected an-
swers of open-domain questions (Pinchak et al.,
2009). In comparison, the loose typing of the
values of our noncontiguous attributes is mostly
coarse-grained. It relies on wh-prefixes (when,
how long, where, how) and possibly subsequent
words (what nutritional value) from the queries,
to determine whether the values are expected to
be a date/time, length/duration, location, manner,
nutritional value etc.
Relations extracted from document sentences
(e.g., “Claude Monet was born in Paris”) are tu-
ples of an instance (claude monet), a text fragment
acting as the lexicalized relation (was born in), and
another instance (paris) (cf. (Fader et al., 2011;
Mausam et al., 2012)). For convenience, the re-
lation and second instance may be concatenated,
as in was born in paris for claude monet. But
document sentences mentioning an instance do not
necessarily refer to properties of the instance that
people other than the author of the document are
likely to inquire about. Consequently, even top-
ranked extracted relations occasionally include
less informative ones, such as comes into view for
mount rainier, is on the table for madeira wine,
or allows for features for javascript (Fader et al.,
2011). Comparatively, relations extracted via non-
contiguous attributes from queries tend to refer to
properties that have values that Web users inquire
about in their search queries. Therefore, the rela-
tions extracted from queries are more likely to re-
fer to salient properties, such as date/time (it) had
its last eruption for mount rainier; length/duration
(it) lasts for madeira wine; and manner (it) stores
date information for javascript.
6 Conclusion
By requesting values for attributes of individual
instances, fact-seeking and explanation-seeking
queries implicitly assert the relevance of the prop-
erties encoded by the attributes, for the respec-
tive instances and their classes. The extracted at-
tributes are not required to take the form of con-
tiguous short phrases in the source queries, thus
allowing for the acquisition of a broader range of
attributes than those extracted by previous meth-
ods. Furthermore, since Web users are interested
in their values, the relations to which the ex-
tracted attributes refer tend to be more relevant
than relations extracted from arbitrary documents
using previous methods. Current work explores
the role of distributional similarities in expanding
extracted attributes for narrow classes; and the ex-
traction of noncontiguous attributes and relations
from natural-language queries without a wh-prefix
(e.g., cars driven by james bond).
