Abstract
This paper presents an approach to au-
tomatic acquisition of the argument-
predicate relations from a semantically
annotated corpus. We use SALSA, a
German newspaper corpus manually an-
notated with role-semantic information
based on frame semantics. Since the rel-
atively small size of SALSA does not al-
low to estimate the semantic relatedness
in the extracted argument-predicate pairs,
we use a larger corpus for ranking. Two
experiments have been performed in or-
der to evaluate the proposed approach.
In the first experiment we compare au-
tomatically extracted argument-predicate
relations with the gold standard formed
from associations provided by human sub-
jects. In the second experiment we cal-
culate correlation between automatic relat-
edness measure and human ranking of the
extracted relations.
1 Introduction
There are many debates in lexical semantics about
what kind of world knowledge actually belongs
to the meaning of a lexeme. Nowadays, it is
widely accepted that predicates impose selectional
restrictions on their arguments. For example, since
we know that the predicate to be hungry mainly
takes expressions describing animate beings as ar-
guments, we can correctly resolve the anaphora
in the following sentence: We gave the bananas
to the monkeys because they were hungry. There
exists also multiple linguistic evidence showing
that the semantics of arguments can help to pre-
dict implicit predicates. For example, the sentence
John finished the cigarette usually means John fin-
ished smoking the cigarette because the meaning
of the noun cigarette is strongly associated with
the smoking activity.
It has been claimed that information about pred-
icates associated with nouns can be helpful for
a variety of tasks in natural language processing
(NLP), see for example (Pustejovsky et al., 1993;
Voorhees, 1994). However, at present there exists
no corresponding lexical semantic resource. Sev-
eral approaches have been presented that aim at
creating a knowledge base containing noun-verb
relations. There are two main research paradigms
for developing such knowledge bases. The first
paradigm assumes manual development of the re-
source (Pustejovsky et al., 2006), while the sec-
ond one relies on automatic acquisition methods,
see for example (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007).
In this paper we propose a procedure for auto-
matic acquisition of argument-predicate relations
from a semantically annotated corpus. In line with
(Lapata and Lascarides, 2003) our approach is
based on the assumption that predicates are omit-
ted in a discourse when they are highly predictable
from the semantics of their arguments. We exploit
SALSA (Burchardt et al., 2006), a German news-
paper corpus manually annotated with FrameNet
frames based on frame semantics. Using a man-
ually annotated corpus for relation extraction has
one particular advantage compared to extraction
from plain text: the type of an argument-predicate
relation is already annotated; there is no need to
determine it by automatic means which are usu-
ally error-prone. However, the relatively small
size of SALSA does not allow to make relevant
predictions about the degree of semantic related-
ness in the extracted argument-predicate pairs, see
section 4. We therefore employ a considerably
larger unannotated corpus for weighting. The re-
sults are evaluated quantitatively against human
judgments obtained experimentally. The proposed
evaluation procedure is similar to that presented in
(Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007). First, we create
a gold standard for 30 words from the argument
list and evaluate our approach with respect to this
1388
gold standard. Second, we provide results from
an evaluation in which test subjects are asked to
rate automatically extracted relations using a four-
point scale.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2
describes some linguistic phenomena requiring in-
ferences of an implicit predicate from the seman-
tics of an explicitly given argument. In section 3
we give a short overview of the related work. Sec-
tions 4 discusses the SALSA corpus. Section 5 in-
troduces our approach. Finally, section 6 describes
an experimental evaluation of the presented ap-
proach and section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Implicit Predicates
In this section we discuss some linguistic phenom-
ena requiring inferences of an implicit predicate
from the semantics of an explicitly given argument
for their resolution. One of the most studied phe-
nomena that Pustejovsky (1991) has called logical
metonymy is illustrated by the examples (1a) and
(1b) below. In the case of logical metonymy an im-
plicit predicate is inferable from particular verb-
noun and adjective-noun pairs in a systematic way.
The verb anfangen ’to start’ and the adjective kom-
pliziert ’complicated’ in the mentioned examples
semantically select for an event, while the nouns
(Buch ’book’ and Frage ’question’ respectively)
have a different semantic type. However, the set
of the most probable implicit predicates is pre-
dictable from the semantics of the nouns. Thus,
(1a) plausibly means Als ich angefangen habe,
dieses Buch zu lesen/schreiben... ’When I have
started to read/write this book...’ and (2a) plau-
sibly means eine Frage die kompliziert zu beant-
worten ist ’a question which is complicated to an-
swer’.
Example 1
(a) Als ich mit diesem Buch angefangen habe...
’When I have started this book...’
(b) eine komplizierte Frage
’a complicated question’
(c) Studentenfutter
’student food’
(d) Nachrichtenagentur Xinhua u¨ber Beziehun-
gen beider Seiten der Taiwan-Strasse
’News agency Xinhua about relations of both
sides of the Taiwan Strait’
(e) Hans ist beredt
’Hans is eloquent’
As we can see from Example 1, besides logi-
cal metonymy there are other linguistic phenom-
ena requiring knowledge about predicates associ-
ated with an argument for their resolution. Exam-
ple (1c) contains a noun compound which can be
interpreted on basis of the meaning of the noun
Futter ’food’. In general, noun compounds can be
interpreted in many different ways depending on
the semantics of the constituencies: morning cof-
fee is a coffee which is drunk in the morning, brick
house is a house which is made of bricks etc. In
case of (1c) the relation via the predicate essen ’to
eat’ taking Studenten ’students’ as a subject and
Futter ’food’ as an object seems to be the most
plausible one.
The phrase (1d) is a title of a newspaper ar-
ticle. As in the previous examples, a predicate
is left out in (1d). The meaning of the prepo-
sition u¨ber ’about’ can help to narrow down the
set of possible predicates, but still allows an in-
adequately large range of interpretations. How-
ever, the semantics of the noun Nachrichtenagen-
tur ’news agency’ supports such interpretations as
berichten ’to report’ or informieren ’to inform’.
Most of the literature discusses predicates infer-
able from nouns. However, other parts of speech
can support similar inferences. In example (1e) a
predicate is predictable on the basis of the mean-
ing of the adjective beredt ’eloquent’. The sen-
tence (1e) most plausibly means that Hans speaks
eloquently.
Example 1 shows that knowledge about pred-
icates associated with explicitly given arguments
can help to deal with several linguistic phenom-
ena. The cases when a predictable predicate is left
out are not rare in natural language. For example,
for logical metonymy a corpus study has shown
that the constructions like begin V NP occur rarely
if the verb V corresponds to a highly plausible in-
terpretation of begin NP (Briscoe et al., 1990).
3 Related Work
The most influential account of logical metonymy
is provided by Pustejovsky’s theory of the Gen-
erative Lexicon, GL (Pustejovsky, 1991). Ac-
cording to Pustejovsky the meaning of a noun in-
cludes a qualia structure representing “the essen-
tial attributes of an object as defined by the lexi-
cal item”. Thus, the lexical meaning of the noun
book includes read and write as qualia roles. In
the framework of GL, Pustejovsky et al. (2006)
1389
are manually developing the Brandeis Semantic
Ontology which is a large generative lexicon on-
tology and dictionary. There also exist several ap-
proaches to automatic acquisition of qualia struc-
tures from text corpora which aim at supporting
the time-consuming manual work. For example,
Pustejovsky et al. (1993) use generalized syntac-
tic patterns for extracting qualia structures from a
partially parsed corpus. Cimiano and Wenderoth
(2007) suggest a pattern-based method for auto-
matic extraction of qualia structures from the Web.
The results of the human judgment experiment re-
ported in (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) suggest
that the automatic acquisition of qualia structures
is a difficult task. Human test subjects have shown
a very low agreement (11,8% average agreement)
in providing qualia structures for given nouns.
Another line of research on inferring implicit
predicates concerns using information about col-
locations derived from corpora. For example,
Lapata and Lascarides (2003) resolve logical
metonymy on the basis of the distribution of para-
phrases like finish the cigarette – finish smok-
ing the cigarette and easy problem – problem
which is easy to solve in a corpus. This approach
shows promising results, but it is limited to logi-
cal metonymy. Similarly, Nastase et al. (2006) use
grammatical collocations for defining semantic re-
lations between constituents in noun compounds.
In our study we aim at extracting intuitively
plausible argument-predicate relations from a se-
mantically annotated corpus. Using an annotated
corpus we avoid problems of defining types of
these relations by automatic means which are usu-
ally error-prone. We represent argument-predicate
relations in terms of FrameNet frames which al-
low for a fine-grained and grounded representation
supporting paraphrasing, see next sections. Our
approach is not restricted to nouns. We also con-
cern relations where argument positions are filled
by adjectives, adverbs or even verbs.
4 The SALSA Corpus
For relation extraction we have chosen the SALSA
corpus (Burchardt et al., 2006) developed at Saar-
land University. SALSA is a German corpus
manually annotated with role-semantic informa-
tion, based on the syntactically annotated TIGER
newspaper corpus (Brants et al., 2002). The
2006 SALSA release which we have used con-
tains about 20 000 annotated predicate instances.
The corpus is annotated with the set of FrameNet
frames.
The FrameNet, FN (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006),
lexical resource is based on frame semantics (Fill-
more, 1976), see http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu.
The lexical meaning of predicates in FN is ex-
pressed in terms of frames (approx. 800 frames)
which are supposed to describe prototypical sit-
uations spoken about in natural language. Every
frame contains a set of roles (or frame elements,
FEs) corresponding to the participants of the de-
scribed situation. Predicates with similar seman-
tics are assigned to the same frame, e.g. to give
and to hand over refer to the GIVING frame. Con-
sider a FN annotation for the sentence (2a) below.
In this annotation DONOR, RECIPIENT and THEME
are roles in the frame GIVING and John, Mary and
a book are fillers of these roles. The FN anno-
tation generalizes across near meaning-preserving
transformations, see (2b).
Example 2
(a) [John]DONOR [gave]GIVING
[Mary]RECIPIENT [a book]THEME.
(b) [John]DONOR [gave]GIVING [a
book]THEME [to Mary]RECIPIENT.
In FN information about syntactic realization
patterns of frame elements as well as information
about frequency of occurrences of these patterns in
corpora is provided. For example, the role DONOR
in the frame GIVING is most frequently filled by a
noun phrase in the subject position or by a prepo-
sitional phrase with the preposition by as the head
in the complement position.
The FN project originally aimed at developing a
frame-semantic lexicon for English. Later on FN
frames turned out to be to a large extent language
independent (Burchardt et al., 2006). In most of
the cases German predicates could be successfully
described by the FN frames. However, some of
the frames required adaptation to the German data,
e.g. new FEs were introduced. Since FN does not
cover all possible word senses, new frames needed
to be added for some of the predicates.
We have chosen the SALSA corpus for our
experiments because to our knowledge it is the
only freely available corpus which contains both
syntactic and role-semantic annotation. However,
we are aware that SALSA (approx. 700 000
tokens) is too small to compute a reliable co-
occurrence model for measuring plausibility of the
extracted argument-predicate relations, though it
1390
is relatively large for a manually annotated cor-
pus. As it was shown in (Bullinaria and Levy,
2007), co-occurrence-based approaches need very
large training corpora in order to reliably compute
semantic relatedness. The SALSA corpus, com-
prising less than 1 million tokens, is too small for
this purpose. Moreover, a considerable number of
predicates in SALSA appeared to be unannotated.
Some of the high frequency pairs, as for exam-
ple Bombe, explodieren ’bomb, to explode’, occur
in SALSA only once, just as occasional pairs like
Deutsche, entdecken ’German, to discover’. We
have tried to overcome the size problems by using
a larger unannotated corpus for recomputing the
rating of our resulting relations, see next section.
5 Automatic Acquisition of the
Argument-Predicate Relations
In line with (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003), our ap-
proach to extraction of argument-predicate (AP)
relations is based on two assumptions:
A1: If predicates are highly predictable from the
semantics of their arguments then they can be
omitted in a discourse;
A2: If a predicate frequently takes a word as an
argument then it is highly predictable from the se-
mantics of this word.
In the proposed experimental setting argument-
predicate relations are defined in terms of the
FrameNet frames. Thus, we aim at extracting
from SALSA tuples of the form ?Argument, ROLE,
FRAME, Predicate? such that the Argument plau-
sibly fills the ROLE in the FRAME evoked by the
Predicate. As already mentioned in section 3,
our approach is not restricted to nouns. We also
treat arguments expressed by other content parts
of speech. The proposed relation extraction pro-
cedure consists in
• finding for every content word which occurs
in the corpus a set of predicates taking this
word as an argument with a high probability;
• defining a relation between the word and ev-
ery predicate from this set by finding which
roles the noun fills in frames evoked by the
predicate;
• estimating the degree of the semantic relat-
edness in the extracted argument-predicate
pairs.
For example, analyzing the following sentence
[Fu¨nf Oppositionelle]SUSPECT sind in Ebe-
biyin [von der Polizei]AUTHORITIES [festgenom-
men]ARREST worden.
’Five members of the opposition have been
arrested by the police in Ebebiyin.’
we aim at extracting the following tuples:
Argument Role Frame Predicate
Oppositionell SUSPECT ARREST festnehmen
Polizei AUTHORITIES ARREST festnehmen
Relation Extraction
In SALSA, every sentence is annotated with a set
of frames in such a way that for every frame its
FEs refer to some syntactic constituents in the sen-
tence. In order to extract argument-predicate rela-
tions from SALSA we need 1) to find a content
head for every constituent corresponding to a FE;
2) to resolve possibly existing anaphora. Since
SALSA is syntactically annotated, the first task
proved to be relatively easy.1 On the contrary,
anaphora resolution is well-known to be one of
most challenging NLP tasks. In our study, we
do not focus on it, and we treat only pronominal
anaphora using the following straightforward res-
olution algorithm: given a pronoun the first noun
which agrees in number and gender with the pro-
noun is supposed to be its antecedent. In order
to evaluate this resolution procedure we have in-
spected 100 anaphoric cases. In approximately
three fourths of the cases the anaphora were re-
solved correctly. Therefore, we have assigned a
confidence rate of 0,75 to the FE fillers resulting
from a resolved anaphora. In non-anaphoric cases
a confidence rate of 1 was assigned.
For every extracted tuple of the form
?Argument, ROLE, FRAME, Predicate? we
have summed up the corresponding confidence
rates. Finally, we have obtained around 30 000
tuples with confidence rates ranging from 0,75
to 88. It is not surprising that most of the argu-
ments appeared to be nouns, while most of the
predicates are expressed by verbs. Since SALSA
has been annotated manually, there are almost
no mistakes in defining types of the semantic

language expressions, while proper nouns were treated in the
usual way. For verb phrases with auxiliary or modal verbs as
heads the main verb was taken as a corresponding role filler.
1391
relations between arguments and predicates.2 For
several pairs, the semantic relation between an
argument and a predicate is ambiguous. Consider
the tuples extracted for the word pair Buch,
schreiben ’book, to write’ which are given below.
While the first tuple corresponds to phrases like
ein Buch schreiben ’to write a book’, the second
one abstracts from the expressions like in einem
Buch schreiben ’to write in a book’.
Argument Role Frame Predicate
Buch TEXT TEXT CREATION schreiben
Buch MEDIUM STATEMENT schreiben
Additionally, ambiguity can arise because of the
annotation disagreements in SALSA. For exam-
ple, the pair (Haft, sitzen) ’imprisonment’, ’to sit’
in Table 1 was annotated in SALSA both with the
BEING LOCATED and with the POSTURE frames.
As mentioned in section 4, a considerable num-
ber of predicates in SALSA is not annotated se-
mantically. In order to find out how many relevant
AP-relations get lost if we consider only seman-
tically annotated predicates, we have additionally
extracted AP-pairs on the basis of the syntactic an-
notation only. The anaphora resolution procedure
as described above was again applied to the syn-
tactic argument heads. We have obtained around
56 500 pairs with confidence rates ranging from
0,75 to 71,50.3
As one could expect, being a newspaper corpus
SALSA appeared to be thematically unbalanced.
The most frequent argument-predicate relations
occurring in SALSA reflect common topics dis-
cussed in newspapers: economics (e.g. (Prozent,
steigen), ’percent’, ’to increase’), criminality (e.g.
(Haft, verurteilen) ’imprisonment’, ’to sentence’),
catastrophes (e.g. (Mensch, to¨ten) ’human’, ’to
kill’) etc.
Ranking
As mentioned in section 4, the size of SALSA
does not allow to make relevant predictions about
the distribution of frames and role fillers. Only
2% of the relations occur in SALSA more then
3 times. In order to overcome this problem we
have developed a measure of semantic relatedness
between the extracted arguments and predicates
2Mistakes can arise only because of the annotation errors
and errors in the anaphora resolution procedure.
3The comparison of the results obtained by the extraction
procedure based on the semantic annotation with the results
of the procedure based on the syntactic annotation only is
provided in the next section.
which takes into account their co-occurrence in a
larger and more representative corpus. For com-
puting semantic relatedness we have used a lem-
matized newspaper corpus (Su¨ddeutsche Zeitung,
SZ) of 145 million words. Given a tuple t with a
confidence rate c containing an argument a and a
predicate p, the relatedness measure rm of t was
computed as follows:
rm(t) = lsa(a, p) + c/max(c),
where the lsa(a, p) is based on Latent Semantic
Analysis, LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990). LSA is
a vector-based technique that has been shown to
give reliable estimates on semantic relatedness. It
makes use of distributional similarities of words
in text and constructs a semantic space (or word
space) in which every word of a given vocabulary
is represented as a vector. Such vectors can then
be compared to one another by the usual vector
similarity measures (e.g. cosine). We calculated
the LSA word space using the Infomap toolkit10
v. 0.8.6 (http://infomap-nlp.sourceforge.net). The
co-occurrence matrix (window size: 5 words)
comprised 80 000×3 000 terms and was reduced
by SVD to 300 dimensions. For the vector com-
parisons the cosine measure was applied. To those
words which did not occur in the analyzed SZ cor-
pus (approx. 3500 words) a lsa measure of 0 was
assigned. To provide a comparable contribution to
rm, the confidence rates c extracted from SALSA
are divided by the maximal confidence rate. The
rm function is a linear interpolation of the lsa and
the normalized c measure. As mentioned above,
the c measure is a discriminative factor for only
2% of the relations. For the remaining 98% the
normalized c values are small (0,003 or 0,002 or
0,001). Therefore, calculating the rm measure we
mainly rely on lsa, while normalized c actually
plays a role only for the relations frequently oc-
curring in SALSA. Table 1 contains the 5 most se-
mantically related predicates for an example argu-
ment.
6 Evaluation
Since the extracted argument-predicate relations
are intended to be used for inferring intuitively ob-
vious predicates,we evaluate to which extend they
correspond to human intuition.

Gold Standard
Similar to (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) we
provide a gold standard for 30 test arguments oc-
curring in the SALSA corpus. The test argu-
ments were selected randomly from the set of
those arguments that have more than one pred-
icate associated with them such that a value of
argument-predicate relatedness exceeds the aver-
age one. These words were nearly uniformly dis-
tributed among 20 participants of the experiment,
who were all non-linguists. We also ensured that
each word was treated by three different subjects.
For every word we asked our subjects to write be-
tween 5 and 10 short phrases that contain a pred-
icate taking the given word as an argument, e.g.
book – to read a book. The participants were asked
to provide phrases instead of single predicates, be-
cause we wanted to control the syntactic and se-
mantic position of the arguments. The participants
received an instruction informally describing the
notion of predicate and what kind of phrases they
are supposed to come up with. Besides the task
description they were shown examples containing
appropriate and inappropriate phrases. Some of
the examples are given below.
Example 3
(a) Aktie ’stock’ : Kauf der Aktien ’buying of
stocks’, Aktien kaufen ’to buy stocks’, Aktien an
der Bo¨rse ’stocks on the bourse’ (is inappropriate
because the word “bourse” describes a place and
not an event)
(b) beredt ’eloquent’: beredt sprechen ’to
speak eloquently’, ein beredter Sprecher ’an elo-
quent speaker’ (is inappropriate because the word
“speaker” describes a person and not an event)
The test was conducted via e-mail. In or-
der to compare the human associations with the
extracted AP-relations, we have manually anno-
tated the obtained phrases with SALSA frames.
The agreement for the described task for every
cue word was calculated as the averaged pairwise
agreement between the AP-relations delivered by
the three subjects, S
1
, S
2
and S
3
, as follows:

.
Agreement results for every cue word are re-
ported in table 2. Second column of the table
contains gold standard predicates which were pro-
vided by all 3 participants treating the same word.4
Averaging over all words, we got a mean agree-
ment of 13%. Though this value seems to be low,
it is consistent with a mean agreement of 11,8%
for a similar task reported in (Cimiano and Wen-
deroth, 2007), see section 3. Cimiano and Wen-
deroth (2007) show that the lowest agreement is
yielded for more abstract words, while the agree-
ment for very concrete words is reasonable. We
could not make a similar observation, see table 2.
Comparison with the Gold Standard
In the first experiment we checked whether pred-
icates which people associate with the test argu-
ments can be automatically extracted by our pro-
cedure. For this aim we compared the gold stan-
dard with all automatically extracted argument-
predicate relations5 containing some of the 30 cue
words as follows. These relations were ranked ac-
cording to the relatedness measure described in
previous section. In line with (Cimiano and Wen-
deroth, 2007) we exploited an approach common
in information retrieval for estimating the qual-
ity of correspondence of a ranked output to a
gold standard, see (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto,
1999).
Given some n automatically extracted relations
with the highest ranking we calculated a precision-
recall curve expressing precision and recall of our
procedure compared to the gold standard. The pre-
cision characterizes the procedure exactness, i.e.
how many redundant relations are retrieved. The
4The overall gold standard consists of 33 tuples.
5In order to evaluate the procedure extracting AP-
relations on the basis of the semantic annotation we com-
pared automatically extracted tuples to the gold standard tu-
ples. For the procedure using the syntactic annotation only
the AP-pairs were considered without regarding frames and
FEs.
1393
recall measures the completeness, i.e. how many
relations of the gold standard are extracted auto-
matically. For each point of the curve (which is
a pair (p, r) of values of precision p and recall r)
we calculated the F -measure as F = 2pr/(p+ r)
which is the harmonic mean between recall and
precision. The precision-recall curve is a set of
precision values for the prespecified recall levels
varying from 0 to 1 with a step 0,1. Then, to pro-
duce only one value evaluating the quality of the
ranked output compared to the gold standard, for
each precision-recall curve we calculated F
max
,
the maximal value of the F -measure achieved
for the points of this curve. F
max
expresses the
best trade-off between precision and recall for the
given ranked output. Finally, among all possible
n (numbers of the considered relations with the
highest ranking) we selected that one which pro-
vides the maximal F
max
value.
The resulting maximal F
max
values are 0,47 for
the procedure extracting AP-relations on the basis
of the semantic annotation and 0,41 for the pro-
cedure using the syntactic annotation only. We
compared these results with the baseline results
of maximal F
max
values produced for the output
with random ranking. The calculation of the base-
line was repeated 100 times, each time a new ran-
dom ranking was generated. The lowest baseline
results are 0,08/0,06 (semantic/syntactic annota-
tion), the highest are 0,18/0,14 and the medians
are 0,1/0,07. One can see that the results produced
using the relatedness measure (0,47/0,41) greatly
exceed the baseline. Based on this comparison we
conclude that the ranking done using the related-
ness measure brings a significant advantage. The
values of precision and recall for the reported max-
imal F
max
values are 0,5/0,33 (semantic/syntactic
annotation) and 0,45/0,54 respectively. This re-
sults show that half of the AP-relations from the
gold standard appeared to be in the list of the top-
ranked tuples extracted by the “semantic” proce-
dure, while the size of this list (n = 28) was al-
most equal to the size of the gold standard (33).
The differences in performance between the “se-
mantic” and “syntactic” procedures could be ex-
plained by the fact that the “syntactic” procedure
finds in the corpus more related predicates for ev-
ery argument than the “semantic” one. Neverthe-
less, the “semantic” procedure shows better per-
formance.
Next we investigated the results for each argu-
ment used in the gold standard separately in the
same way as described above. For each argument
the F
max
measure has been computed. Because
of the low agreement between the subjects ques-
tioned for the gold standard (see above), in these
calculations we considered all predicates reported
by our subjects. The calculated F
max
values are
reported in table 2 which shows a correlation be-
tween F
max
values calculated for the “semantic”
and “syntactic” procedures. However, there is
no correlation with human agreement. This issue
needs a further investigation, see section 7.
Human Judgments of the Relatedness
Following (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007), in or-
der to check whether the calculated relatedness
is reasonable according to human intuition, we
have performed another experiment. For each of
the 30 words selected for the gold standard we
selected the 5 top ranked predicates. Since for
some of the cue arguments only 3 predicates were
found in the corpus, the final test set contains only
138 argument-predicate tuples. From these tuples
we generated short grammatically correct phrases
structurally similar to those in example 3. These
phrases were uniformly distributed among 10 sub-
jects so that every phrase was evaluated by one
subject. The participants were asked to rate the
phrases with respect to their naturalness using a
scale from 0 to 3, whereby 0 means ’unnatural’,
1 ’possible’, 2 ’natural’ and 3 ’totally natural and
self-evident’.
Further on we investigated the relationship be-
tween the human estimates and the relatedness
values obtained automatically. For this aim we
used the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
Because of four-points scale used, the human
rankings are equal for many tuples which lead to
the so-called effect of ties. For this reason we
computed the correlation coefficient with a cor-
rection for ties. The coefficient value is 0,30 and
this correlation is statistically significant with p-
value 0,0006. Based on these results we conclude
that our relatedness measure is correlated with hu-
man judgments. Taking into account the subjec-
tive character of human ranking in terms of nat-
uralness, the achieved correlation values can be
considered as high.

7 Conclusion and Discussion
In this paper we presented an approach to auto-
matic extraction of argument-predicate relations
from a frame-annotated corpus.6 In our approach
we aimed to combine the advantages offered by
annotated and unannotated lexical resources. Be-
sides extracting AP-pairs the proposed method al-
lows us to define types of semantic relations in
terms of FrameNet frames. The proposed proce-
dure is not restricted to arguments expressed by
nouns and treats also other content parts of speech.
The main goal of this paper was to show that
though manually annotated corpora usually have
a relatively small size, they can be successfully
exploited for the relation extraction. An obvious
limitation of the presented approach is that it is
bounded to manual annotations which are hard
to obtain. However, since semantic annotations
are useful for many different goals in linguistics
and NLP, the number of reliable annotated cor-
pora constantly grows.7 Moreover, recently sev-
6The complete list of the extracted AP-relations as well
as the results of the experiment will be available online at
http://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/?eovchinn/APrels/.
7At present FrameNet annotated corpora are
eral tools have been developed which perform role
annotation automatically, for example see (Erk
and Pado, 2006). Therefore we believe that ap-
proaches using semantic annotation are valid and
promising. In the future we plan to experiment
with large role-annotated corpora for English such
as PropBank (approx. 300 000 words, (Palmer
et al., 2005)) and the FrameNet-annotated corpus
provided by the FN project (more than 135 000
annotated sentences, (Ruppenhofer et al., 2006)).
Since these corpora do not contain syntactic anno-
tation, for extracting argument-predicate relations
we will need to parse annotated sentences.
There are several ways to improve the proposed
procedure. First, an implementation of a more
advanced anaphora resolution algorithm treating
pronominal as well as nominal anaphora should
significantly raise the precision/recall characteris-
tics. Second, splitting German compounds occur-
ring in the corpus should provide additional ev-
idence. We have treated such words as Kunde
’client’ and Privatkunde ’private client’ as differ-
ent lexemes, while they are strongly related se-
available for English, German and Spanish, see
http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu.

mantically and information about predicates co-
occurring with the second word could probably
be used for describing the semantics of the first
one. Concerning relatedness measure, additional
corpus-based measures such as Web-based mea-
sures (Cimiano and Wenderoth, 2007) or measures
based on syntactic relations (Pustejovsky et al.,
1993) could appear to be useful for improving the
ranking of the extracted relations.
The presented procedure was evaluated quanti-
tatively against human judgments obtained experi-
mentally. The participants of the experiment were
asked to provide short phrases containing given
cue words and predicates associated with these
words as well as to rate phrases generated from the
automatically extracted AP-relations. Concerning
the first experiment, the low human agreement has
shown that the proposed association task appeared
to be difficult for the subjects. Nevertheless, the
described learning procedure proved to extract in-
tuitively reasonable relations.
The evaluation strategy presented in this pa-
per on relies on the underlying assumptions (A1
and A2 in section 5) and is compatible with the
other approaches to relation extraction, cf. (Cimi-
ano and Wenderoth, 2007). However, it is plau-
sible that human responses in the context of pro-
viding associated predicates for target words will
differ from the responses in the experimental set-
tings where subjects are asked to infer implicit
predicates, e.g. to extend phrases containing im-
plicit predicates. In the future we plan to im-
plement a procedure making use of the extracted
AP-relations which would automatically extend
phrases containing implicit predicates. Then we
intend to compare output results of the procedure
with the human responses. Additionally, a study of
a possible correspondence between human agree-
ment on associated predicates and a semantic type
of an argument (e.g. concrete/abstract, natural
kind/artifact) should be performed on more test ar-
guments.
Potential Applications
As already mentioned in the literature, see for ex-
ample (Lapata and Lascarides, 2003), knowledge
about implicit predicates could be potentially use-
ful for a variety of NLP tasks such as language
generation, information extraction, question an-
swering or machine translation. Many applica-
tions of semantic relations in NLP are connected
to paraphrasing or query expansion, see for ex-
ample (Voorhees, 1994). Suppose that a search
engine or a question answering system receives
the query schnelle Bombe ’quick bomb’. Prob-
ably, in this case the user is interested in find-
ing information about bombs that explode quickly
rather then about bombs in general. Knowledge
about predicates associated with the noun Bombe
’bomb’ could be used for predicting a set of prob-
able implicit predicates. For generation of the se-
mantically and syntactically correct paraphrases it
is sometimes not enough to guess the most prob-
able argument-predicate pairs. Information about
types of an argument-predicate relation could be
helpful, i.e. which semantic and syntactic posi-
tion does the argument fill in the argument struc-
ture of the predicate. For example, compare
eine Bombe explodiert schnell ’a bomb explodes
quickly’ for schnelle Bombe with ein Buch schnell
lesen/schreiben ’to read/write a book quickly’ for
schnelles Buch ’quick book’. In the first case the
argument Bombe fills the subject position, while
in the second case Buch fills the object posi-
tion. Since FrameNet contains information about
syntactic realization patterns for frame elements,
representation of argument-predicate relations in
terms of frames directly supports generation of se-
mantically and syntactically correct paraphrases.
The described procedure could also support
manual development of a lexical resource, provid-
ing evidence from corpora as well as the distribu-
tional information.
