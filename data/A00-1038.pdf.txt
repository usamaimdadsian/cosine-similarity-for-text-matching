Abstract 
A large-scale controlled vocabulary indexing 
system is described. The system currently 
covers almost 70,000 named entity topics, 
and applies to documents from thousands of 
news publications. Topic definitions are built 
through substantially automated knowledge 
engineering. 
1 Introduction 
The goal of the Entity Indexing R&D program at 
LEXIS-NEXIS is to add controlled vocabulary 
indexing for named entities to searchable fields in 
appropriate news documents across thousands of 
news publications, where documents include both 
incoming news articles as well as news articles 
already in the LEXIS-NEXIS archives. A con- 
trolled vocabulary term (CVT) is a consistently 
specified topic indicator that users can incorporate 
into their queries in order to retrieve documents 
about the corresponding topic. When a CVT is 
added to an appropriate field in a document, it can 
be included in a Boolean query using 
field-name(controlled vocabulary term) 
The initial Entity Indexing release focused on 
companies as topics. For company indexing, the 
primary CFT is a standard form of the company 
name. When we add a company CVT to a docu- 
ment, we often also want to add secondary CFTs to 
the document that specify attributes of that com- 
pany. Attributes may include the ticker symbol, 
SIC product codes, industry codes and company 
headquarters information. Secondary CVTs allow 
customers to easily search on groups of companies 
that have one or more attributes in common, such 
as searching for documents about banks in our set 
of companies that are headquartered in Utah. 
It is generally easy to get high recall with Boolean 
queries when searching for documents about 
named entities. Typically the query will only need 
a short form of the entity's name. For example, the 
query 
American 
will retrieve virtually every document that men- 
tions American Airlines. Of course, this query re- 
sults in poor precision due to the ambiguity of 
American. The problem we wanted to address with 
controlled vocabulary indexing is to help online 
customers limit their search results to only those 
documents that contain a major reference to the 
topic, that is, to documents that are substantially 
about he topic. 
Because of the volume of news data we have, it is 
necessary that we fully automate the document 
categorization a d indexing step in our data prepa- 
ration process. LEXIS-NEXIS adds 100,000 news 
articles daily to its collection of over 2 billion 
documents. 
For marketing and product positioning reasons, we 
want to provide indexing for tens of thousands of 
companies, where companies are targeted based on 
their presence on the New York, American and 
NASDAQ exchanges or on revenue-based criteria. 
Although such selection criteria help us explain the 
product feature to customers, it does not ensure 
that the targeted companies actually appear all that 
often in the news. In fact, for many targeted com- 
panies there is little training and test data available. 
Our company indexing system should address the 
following business product requirements: 
• Assign primary and corresponding secondary 
CVTs to appropriate documents 
276 
• Add CVTs only to those documents hat con- 
tain major eferences to the topic(s) 
• Process documents fast; target 30,000 charac- 
ters per CPU second 
• Apply tens of thousands of topics to the data in 
a single pass 
* Minimize the cost of developing and main- 
taining topic definitions 
Also, we target 90% recall and 95% precision 
when using the CVTs to retrieve major reference 
documents about he corresponding companies. 
2 Related Work 
The Carnegie Group's Text Categorization Shell 
(TCS) (Hayes, 1992) uses shallow knowledge n- 
gineering techniques to categorize documents with 
respect o large sets of predefined topics. Each 
topic requires the development of a rule set that 
includes terms, contextual information, weighting, 
if-then rules and other pattern matching operations. 
This initially involved a manual, iterative approach 
to rule development, although Hayes (1992) dis- 
cusses their intent o explore ways to automate this. 
TCS accuracy is quite good. One application de- 
ployed at Reuters achieved 94% recall and 84% 
precision. Other reported tests achieved recall and 
precision rates of 90% or better. 
SRA's NameTag (Krupka, 1995) uses a pattem 
recognition process that combines a rule base with 
lexicons to identify and extract targeted token 
classes in text, such as company, people and place 
names. It achieved 96% recall and 97% precision 
when tested on Wall Street Journal news articles at 
MUC-6. Aone et al. (1997) describes a NameTag- 
based application for indexing English and Japa- 
nese language texts. NameTag addresses a key 
weakness of approaches that use predefined topic 
sets. Predefined topic sets are inherently limited in 
their coverage to those topics that have been ex- 
plicitly defined. NameTag can recognize any num- 
ber of companies or entities of other domains 
whose names have structure that the rules can rec- 
ognize. (Not all entity domains have structure that 
pattern recognition processes can exploit, e.g., 
product names). 
A problem for pattern recognition approaches has 
to do with our requirement toassign CVTs. Pattern 
recognition approaches extract patterns such as 
company names as they appear in the text. Limited 
coreference resolution may link variant forms of 
names with one another to support choosing the 
best variant as a "semi-controlled" vocabulary 
term, but this does not allow for the assignment of
true primary and secondary CVTs. SRA has at- 
tempted to address this through its Name Resolver 
function, which reconciles extracted names with an 
authority file, but the authority file also limits 
scope of coverage for CVTs to those that are de- 
fined and maintained in the authority file. The 
system must also go beyond straight recognition i  
order to make a distinction between documents 
with major references to the targeted entities and 
documents with lesser or passing references. 
SRA's NameTag addresses this with the calcula- 
tion of relevance scores for each set of linked vari- 
ant forms. 
Preliminary research suggests that recognizing 
named entities in data and queries may lead to a 
significant improvement in retrieval quality 
(Thompson & Dozier, 1999). Such an approach 
may complement Entity Indexing, but it does not 
yet meet the controlled vocabulary indexing and 
accuracy requirements for Entity Indexing. 
Our own Term-based Topic Identification (TFI) 
system (Leigh, 1991) combines knowledge ngi- 
neering with limited learning in support of docu- 
ment categorization and indexing by CVTs. We 
have used TI'I since 1990 to support a number of 
topically-related news or legal document collec- 
tions. Categories are defined through topic defini- 
tions. A definition includes terms to look up, term 
weights, term frequency thresholds, document se- 
lection scoring thresholds, one or more CVTs, and 
source-specific document structure information. 
Although creating TI'I topic definitions is primar- 
ily an iterative, manual task, limited regression- 
based supervised learning tools are available to 
help identify functionally redundant terms, and to 
suggest erm weights, frequency thresholds and 
scoring thresholds. When these tools have been 
used in building topic definitions, recall and preci- 
sion have topped 90% in almost all tests. 
277 
3 Approach 
"ITI was originally proposed as a tool to support 
controlled vocabulary indexing, and most early 
tests focused on narrowly defined legal and news 
topics such as insurable interest and earthquakes. 
TH was also tested on a number of companies, 
people, organizations and places as topics. TTI was 
first put into production to categorize documents 
by broadly-defined topics such as Europe political 
and business news and federal tax law. 
When we began investigating the possibility of 
creating Entity Indexing, TTI was a natural starting 
point. It had demonstrated high accuracy and flexi- 
bility across a variety of topics and data types. 
Three problems were also apparent. First, TTI 
would not scale to support several thousand topics. 
Second, it took a long time to build a topic defini- 
tion, about one staff day each. Third, topics were 
defined on a publication-specific basis. With then- 
700 publications in our news archives in combina- 
tion with our scale goals and the time needed to 
build topic definitions, the definition building costs 
were too high. We needed to scale the technology, 
and we needed to substantially automate the topic 
definition-building process. 
For Entity Indexing, we addressed scale concerns 
through software tuning, substantially improved 
memory management, a more efficient hash func- 
tion in the lookup algorithm, and moving domain- 
specific functionality from topic definitions into 
the software. The rest of this paper focuses on the 
cost of building the definitions. 
3.1 Analyzing Companies in the News 
In order to reduce definition building costs, we 
originally believed that we would focus on in- 
creasing our reliance on TTrs training tools. 
Training data would have to include documents 
from a variety of publications if we were to be able 
to limit definitions to one per topic regardless of 
the publications covered. 
Unfortunately the data did not cooperate. Using a 
list of all companies on the major U.S. stock ex- 
changes, we randomly selected 89 companies for 
investigation. Boolean searches were used to re- 
trieve documents that mentioned those companies. 
We found that several of these companies were 
rarely mentioned in the news. One company was 
not mentioned at all in our news archives, a second 
one was mentioned only once, and twelve were 
mentioned only in passing. Several appeared as 
major references in only a few documents. In a 
second investigation involving 40,000 companies 
from various ources, fully half appeared in zero or 
only one news document in one two-year window. 
We questioned whether we even wanted to create 
topic definitions for such rarely occurring compa- 
nies. Again, marketing and product positioning 
reasons dictated that we do so: it is easier to tell 
customers that the product feature covers all com- 
panics that meet one of a few criteria than it is to 
give customers a list of the individual companies 
covered. It is also reasonable to assume that public 
and larger companies may appear in the news at 
some future point. 
3.2 Company Name Usage 
While analyzing news articles about hese compa- 
nies, we noted how company names and their vari- 
ants were used. For most companies discussed in 
documents that contained major references to the 
company, some form of the full company name 
typically appears in the leading text. Shorter vari- 
ants typically are used for subsequent mentions as 
well as in the headline. Corresponding ticker sym- 
bols often appear in the headline or leading text, 
but only after a variant of the company name ap- 
pears. In some publications, ticker symbols are 
used as shorter variants throughout the document. 
Acronyms are somewhat rare; when they are used, 
they behave like other shorter variants of the name. 
Shorter variants typically are substrmgs of the full 
company name beginning with the leftmost words 
in the name. For a company named 
Samson Computing Supply Inc. 
shorter variants might include 
Samson Computing Supply 
Samson Computing 
Samson 
Acronyms typically exist only for companies 
whose names consist of at least two words in addi- 
tion to company designators such as Inc. or Corp. 
There is no consistency as to whether the company 
278 
designators contribute to acronyms. Thus for the 
above xample 
SCSI 
SCS 
are both potential acronyms. 
Generating such variants from a full form of a 
company name is straightforward. Similarly, rules 
working with a table of equivalences can handle 
common abbreviations, sothe variant 
Samson Computing Supply Incorporated 
can be generated from 
Samson Computing Supply lnc. 
We assign weights to term variants based on term 
length and the presence or absence of company 
designators. Longer variants with designators are 
regarded as less ambiguous than shorter variants 
without designators, and thus have higher weights. 
A table of particularly problematic one-word vari- 
ants, such as American, National and General, is 
used to make a weighting distinction between these 
and other one-word variants. One-word variants 
are also marked so they do not match lower case 
strings during lookup. A label is assigned to each 
variant o indicate its function and relative strength 
in the document categorization process. 
3.3 Generating Topic Defmitions 
Our company controlled vocabulary indexing pro- 
cess requires definition builders to provide a pri- 
mary CVT and zero or more secondary CVTs for 
each targeted company. The CVTs are the primary 
input to the automatic topic definition generation 
process. If the definition builder provides the com- 
pany name and ticker symbol to be used as CVTs 
for some company, as in 
#CO = Samson Computing Supply lnc. 
#TS = SMCS (NrSE) 
the following definition can be generated auto- 
matically: 
#NAME1 = Samson Computing Supply Inc. 
#NAME1 = Samson Computing Supply Incor- 
porated 
#NAME2 = Samson Computing Supply 
#NAME3 = Samson Computing 
#NAME4 = Samson 
#TS @= SMCS {upper case only} 
#ACRONYM @= SCSI {upper case only} 
#ACRONYM @= SCS {upper case only} 
#BLOCK @= samson {do not match lower 
case} 
That two acronyms were generated points out a 
potential problem with using robust variant gen- 
eration as a means to automatically build topic 
definitions. Overgeneration will produce some 
name variants that have nothing to do with the 
company. However, although overgeneration f
variants routinely occurs, testing showed that such 
overgeneration has little adverse ffect. 
This approach to automatically generating topic 
definitions is successful for most companies, in- 
cluding those that appear arely in our data, be- 
cause most company names and their variants have 
consistent structure and use patterns. There are 
exceptions. Some companies are so well-lmown 
that they often appear in news articles without he 
corresponding full company name. Large compa- 
nies and companies with high visibility (e.g., Mi- 
crosoft, AT&T, NBC and Kmart) are among these. 
Other companies simply have unusual names. Our 
authority file is an editable text file where defini- 
tion builders not only store and maintain the pri- 
mary and secondary CVTs for each company, but 
it also allows builders to specify exception infor- 
mation that can be used to override any or all of the 
results of the automatic definition generation proc- 
ess. In addition, builders can use two additional 
labels to identify especially strong name variants 
(e.g., IBM for International Business Machines) 
and related terms whose presence in a document 
provide disambiguating context (e.g., Delta, air- 
port and flights for American Airlines, often re- 
ferred to only as American). For our initial release 
of 15,000 companies, 17% of the definitions had 
some manual intervention beyond providing pri- 
mary and secondary CVTs. Entity definitions built 
entirely manually usually took less than thirty min- 
utes apiece. Overall, on average less than five min- 
utes were spent per topic on definition building. 
This includes the time used to identify the targeted 
companies and add their primary and secondary 
CVTs to the authority file. Populating the authority 
279 
file is required regardless of the technical approach 
used. 
3.4 Applying Definitions to Documents 
All topic definitions contain a set of labeled terms 
to look up. The document categorization process 
combines these into a large lookup table. A lookup 
step applies the table to a document and records 
term frequency information. If a match occurs in 
the headline or leading text, extra "frequency" is
recorded in order to place extra emphasis on 
lookup matches in those parts of the document. If
the same term is in several definitions (e.g., Ameri- 
can is a short name variant in hundreds of defini- 
tions), frequency information is recorded for each 
definition. 
Once the end of the document is reached, fre- 
quency and term label-based weights are used to 
calculate a score for each topic. If the score ex- 
ceeds some threshold, corresponding CVTs are 
added to the document. Typically a few matches of 
high-weight terms or a variety of lower-weighted 
terms are necessary to produce scores above the 
threshold. A document may be about more than 
one targeted topic. 
3.5 System Implementation 
The tools used to build and maintain topic defini- 
tions were implemented in C/C++ on UNIX-based 
workstations. The document categorization process 
was implemented in PL1 and a proprietary lexical 
scanner, and operates in a mainframe MVS envi- 
ronment. 
4 Evaluation 
In the fmal pre-release t st, Entity Indexing was 
applied to more than 13,500 documents from 250 
publications. Each document in the test was re- 
viewed by a data analyst. Several of these were 
also reviewed by a researcher to verify the ana- 
lysts' consistency with the formal evaluation crite- 
ria. Recall was 92.0% and precision was 96.5% 
when targeting documents with major references. 
Additional spot tests were done after the process 
was applied in production to archived ocuments 
and to incoming documents. These tests routinely 
showed recall and precision to be in the 90% to 
96% range on over 100,000 documents examined. 
Some recall errors were due to company names 
with unusual structure. Many such problems can 
be addressed through manual intervention i  the 
topic definitions. Some publication styles also led 
to recall errors. One publisher introduces a variety 
of unanticipated abbreviations, uch as Intnl for 
International. Trade publications tend to use only 
short forms of company names even for lesser 
known companies. Those companies may be well- 
known only within an industry and thus to the 
audience of the trade publication. These types of 
problems can be addressed through manual inter- 
vention in the topic definitions, although for the 
abbreviations problem this is little more than 
patching. 
Capitalized and all upper case text in headlines and 
section headings was a routine source of precision 
errors. These often led to unwanted term matching, 
particularly affecting acronyms and one-word 
company name variants. Different companies with 
similar names also led to precision problems. This 
was particularly tree for subsidiaries of the same 
company whose names differed only by geo- 
graphically-distinct company designators. 
5 Discussion 
Entity Indexing applies in production to tens of 
thousands of documents daily from thousands of 
news publications. Further tests have shown that 
we can reach comparably high levels of accuracy 
for company topics when Entity Indexing is ap- 
plied to financial, patents and public records 
sources. Accuracy rates dropped about 10% in 
tests applied to case law parties. 
Since the initial completion of the company in- 
dexing work, Entity Indexing has been extended to 
cover more companies and other named entities, 
including people, organizations and places. Topic 
definitions have been built for almost 70,000 enti- 
ties, including over 30,000 companies. Entity In- 
dexing applies these definitions during a single 
pass of the data, processing more than 86,000 
characters (approximately 16news documents) per 
CPU second. 
The approach used for the other named entity types 
is similar to that for companies. However, because 
most of the place names we targeted lacked useful 
280 
internal structure, manual intervention was a part 
of creating all 800 definitions for places. Accuracy 
rates for people, organization and geographic in- 
dexing are comparable to those for company in- 
dexing. 
Knowledge engineering can be a bottleneck in 
building large-scale applications, which is why 
machine learning-based approaches are often pre- 
ferred, but there has been little work in quantifying 
the difference between the two approaches in lin- 
guistic tasks (Brill & Ngai, 1999). In our case, 
adopting amachine learning-based approach was a 
problem not just because we lacked annotated 
training data, but for many of the topics we were 
required to target we had little or no available data 
at all. However, because of the regularity we ob- 
served in company name variants and their use 
across a variety of news sources, we determined 
that the knowledge ngineering task would be quite 
repetitive and thus could be automated for most 
companies. 
Our Entity Indexing system meets all of our busi- 
ness requirements for accuracy, scale and perform- 
ance. We have also substantially automated the 
definition building process. Even if a number of 
documents were available for each targeted entity, 
it is unlikely that we would see the time needed to 
populate the authority file and to create and anno- 
tate appropriate training data in a machine learn- 
ing-based approach fall much below the under five 
minutes we average per definition with our chosen 
approach.
