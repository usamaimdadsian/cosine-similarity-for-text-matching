Abstract
In this paper, we explore the classification of
emotions in songs, using the music and the
lyrics representation of the songs. We intro-
duce a novel corpus of music and lyrics, con-
sisting of 100 songs annotated for emotions.
We show that textual and musical features can
both be successfully used for emotion recog-
nition in songs. Moreover, through compar-
ative experiments, we show that the joint use
of lyrics and music brings significant improve-
ments over each of the individual textual and
musical classifiers, with error rate reductions
of up to 31%.
1 Introduction
Language and music are peculiar characteristics of
human beings. The capability of producing and
enjoying language and music appears in every hu-
man society, regardless of the richness of its culture
(Nettl, 2000).
Importantly, language and music complement
each other in many different ways. For instance,
looking at music and language in terms of fea-
tures, we can observe that music organizes pitch
and rhythm in ways that language does not, and it
lacks the specificity of language in terms of seman-
tic meaning. On the other hand, language is built
from categories that are absent in music (e.g., nouns
and verbs), whereas music seems to have a deeper
power over our emotions than does ordinary speech.
Composers, musicians, and researchers in poetry
and literature alike have been long fascinated by the
combination of language and music, even since the
time of the earliest written records of music encoun-
tered in musical settings for poetry. Despite this in-
terest, and despite the long history of the interaction
between music and lyrics, there is only little work
that explicitly focuses on the connection between
music and lyrics.
In this paper, we focus on the connection between
the musical and linguistic representations in popu-
lar songs, and their role in the expression of affect.
We introduce a novel corpus of lyrics and music, an-
notated for emotions at line level, and explore the
automatic recognition of emotions using both tex-
tual and musical features. Through comparative ex-
periments, we show that emotion recognition can be
performed using either textual or musical features,
and that the joint use of lyrics and music can im-
prove significantly over classifiers that use only one
dimension at a time. We believe our results demon-
strate the promise of using joint music-lyric models
for song processing.
2 Related Work
The literature on music analysis is noticeably large,
and there are several studies concerning the music’s
power over emotions (Juslin and Sloboda, 2001),
thinking (Rauscher et al., 1993), or physical effort
(Karageorghis and Priest, 2008).
In particular, there has been significant research
in music and psychology focusing on the idea of a
parallel between affective cues in music and speech
(Sundberg, 1982; Scherer, 1995). For instance,
(Scherer, 2004) investigated the types of emotions
that can be induced by music, their mechanisms, and
how they can be empirically measured. (Juslin and
590
Laukka, 2003) conducted a comprehensive review
of vocal expressions and music performance, find-
ing substantial overlap in the cues used to convey
basic emotions in speech and music.
The work most closely related to ours is the com-
bination of audio and lyrics for emotion classifica-
tion in songs, as thoroughly surveyed in (Kim et al.,
2010). Although several methods have been pro-
posed, including a combination of textual features
and beats per minute and MPEG descriptors (Yang
and Lee, 2004); individual audio and text classifiers
for arousal and valence, followed by a combination
through meta-learning (Yang et al., 2008); and the
use of crowdsourcing labeling from Last.fm to col-
lect large datasets of songs annotated for emotions
(Laurier et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2009), all this pre-
vious work was done at song level, and most of
it focused on valence-arousal classifications. None
of the previous methods considered the fine-grained
classification of emotions at line level, as we do, and
none of them considered the six Ekman emotions
used in our work.
Other related work consists of the development
of tools for music accessing, filtering, classification,
and retrieval, focusing primarily on music in digital
format such as MIDI. For instance, the task of music
retrieval and music recommendation has received a
lot of attention from both the arts and the computer
science communities (see for instance (Orio, 2006)
for an introduction to this task). There are also sev-
eral works on MIDI analysis. Among them, partic-
ularly relevant to our research is the work by (Das
et al., 2000), who described an analysis of predom-
inant up-down motion types within music, through
extraction of the kinematic variables of music veloc-
ity and acceleration from MIDI data streams. (Catal-
tepe et al., 2007) addressed music genre classifica-
tion (e.g., classic, jazz, pop) using MIDI and au-
dio features, while (Wang et al., 2004) automati-
cally aligned acoustic musical signals with their cor-
responding textual lyrics. MIDI files are typically
organized into one or more parallel “tracks” for in-
dependent recording and editing. A reliable system
to identify the MIDI track containing the melody1
is very relevant for music information retrieval, and
1A melody can be defined as a “cantabile” sequence of
notes, usually the sequence that a listener can remember after
hearing a song.
there are several approaches that have been proposed
to address this issue (Rizo et al., 2006; Velusamy et
al., 2007).
Another related study concerned with the interac-
tion of lyrics and music using an annotated corpus is
found in (O’Hara, 2011), who presented preliminary
research that checks whether the expressive meaning
of a particular harmony or harmonic sequence could
be deduced from the lyrics it accompanies, by us-
ing harmonically annotated chords from the Usenet
group alt.guitar.tab.
Finally, in natural language processing, there are
a few studies that mainly exploited the lyrics com-
ponent of the songs, while generally ignoring the
musical component. For instance, (Mahedero et al.,
2005) dealt with language identification, structure
extraction, and thematic categorization for lyrics.
(Xia et al., 2008) addressed the task of sentiment
classification in lyrics, recognizing positive and neg-
ative moods in a large dataset of Chinese pop songs,
while (Yang and Lee, 2009) approached the problem
of emotion identification in lyrics, classifying songs
from allmusic.com using a set of 23 emotions.
3 A Corpus of Music and Lyrics
Annotated for Emotions
To enable our exploration of emotions in songs, we
compiled a corpus of 100 popular songs (e.g., Danc-
ing Queen by ABBA, Hotel California by Eagles,
Let it Be by The Beatles). Popular songs exert a
lot of power on people, both at an individual level
as well as on groups, mainly because of the mes-
sage and emotions they convey. Songs can lift our
moods, make us dance, or move us to tears. Songs
are able to embody deep feelings, usually through a
combined effect of both music and lyrics.
The corpus is built starting with the MIDI tracks
of each song, by extracting the parallel alignment
of melody and lyrics. Given the non-homogeneous
quality of the MIDI files available on the Web, we
asked a professional MIDI provider for high quality
MIDI files produced for singers and musicians. The
MIDI files, which were purchased from the provider,
contain also lyrics that are synchronized with the
notes. In these MIDI files, the melody channel is un-
equivocally decided by the provider, making it easier
to extract the music and the corresponding lyrics.
591
MIDI format. MIDI is an industry-standard pro-
tocol that enables electronic musical instruments,
computers, and other electronic equipment to com-
municate and synchronize with each other. Unlike
analog devices, MIDI does not transmit an audio
signal: it sends event messages about musical no-
tation, pitch, and intensity, control signals for pa-
rameters such as volume, vibrato, and panning, and
cues and clock signals to set the tempo. As an elec-
tronic protocol, it is notable for its widespread adop-
tion throughout the music industry.
MIDI files are typically created using computer-
based sequencing software that organizes MIDI
messages into one or more parallel “tracks” for in-
dependent recording, editing, and playback. In most
sequencers, each track is assigned to a specific MIDI
channel, which can be then associated to specific in-
strument patches. MIDI files can also contain lyrics,
which can be displayed in synchrony with the music.
Starting with the MIDI tracks of a song, we ex-
tract and explicitly encode the following features.
At the song level, the key of the song (e.g., G ma-
jor, C minor). At the line level, we represent the
raising, which is the musical interval (in half-steps)
between the first note in the line and the most impor-
tant note (i.e., the note in the line with the longest
duration). Finally, at the note level, we encode the
time code of the note with respect to the beginning
of the song; the note aligned with the corresponding
syllable; the degree of the note with relation to the
key of the song; and the duration of the note.
Table 1 shows statistics on the corpus. An exam-
ple from the corpus, consisting of the first two lines
from the Beatles’ song A hard day’s night, is illus-
trated in Figure 3.

Emotion Annotations with Mechanical Turk. In
order to explore the classification of emotions in
songs, we needed a gold standard consisting of man-
ual emotion annotations of the songs. Following
previous work on emotion annotation of text (Alm
et al., 2005; Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007), to
annotate the emotions in songs we use the six ba-
sic emotions proposed by (Ekman, 1993): ANGER,
DISGUST, FEAR, JOY, SADNESS, SURPRISE. To col-
lect the annotations, we use the Amazon Mechanical
Turk service, which was previously found to pro-
duce reliable annotations with a quality comparable
to those generated by experts (Snow et al., 2008).
The annotations are collected at line level, with a
separate annotation for each of the six emotions. We
collect numerical annotations using a scale between
0 and 10, with 0 corresponding to the absence of an
emotion, and 10 corresponding to the highest inten-
sity. Each HIT (i.e., annotation session) contains an
entire song, with a number of lines ranging from 14
to 110, for an average of 50 lines per song.
The annotators were instructed to: (1) Score the
emotions from the writer perspective, not their own
perspective; (2) Read and interpret each line in con-
text; i.e., they were asked to read and understand
the entire song before producing any annotations;
(3) Produce the six emotion annotations independent
from each other, accounting for the fact that a line
could contain none, one, or multiple emotions. In
addition to the lyrics, the song was also available
online, so they could listen to it in case they were
not familiar with it. The annotators were also given
three different examples to illustrate the annotation.
While the use of crowdsourcing for data annota-
tion can result in a large number of annotations in
a very short amount of time, it also has the draw-
back of potential spamming that can interfere with
the quality of the annotations. To address this aspect,
we used two different techniques to prevent spam.
First, in each song we inserted a “checkpoint” at a
random position in the song – a fake line that reads
“Please enter 7 for each of the six emotions.” Those
annotators who did not follow this concrete instruc-
tion were deemed as spammers who produce anno-
tations without reading the content of the song, and
thus removed. Second, for each remaining annota-
tor, we calculated the Pearson correlation between
her emotion scores and the average emotion scores
of all the other annotators. Those annotators with a
correlation with the average of the other annotators
below 0.4 were also removed, thus leaving only the
reliable annotators in the pool.

For each song, we start by asking for ten annota-
tions. After spam removal, we were left with about
two-five annotations per song. The final annotations
are produced by averaging the emotions scores pro-
duced by the reliable annotators. Figure 3 shows
an example of the emotion scores produced for two
lines. The overall correlation between the remain-
ing reliable annotators was calculated as 0.73, which
represents a strong correlation.
For each of the six emotions, Table 2 shows the
number of lines that had that emotion present (i.e.,
the score of the emotion was different from 0), as
well as the average score for that emotion over all
4,976 lines in the corpus. Perhaps not surprisingly,
the emotions that are dominant in the corpus are JOY
and SADNESS – which are the emotions that are of-
ten invoked by people as the reason behind a song.
Note that the emotions do not exclude each other:
i.e., a line that is labeled as containing JOY may also
contain a certain amount of SADNESS, which is the
reason for the high percentage of songs containing
both JOY and SADNESS. The emotional load for
the overlapping emotions is however very different.
For instance, the lines that have a JOY score of 5
or higher have an average SADNESS score of 0.34.
Conversely, the lines with a SADNESS score of 5 or

4 Experiments and Evaluations
Through our experiments, we seek to determine the
extent to which we can automatically determine the
emotional load of each line in a song, for each of the
six emotion dimensions.
We use two main classes of features: textual fea-
tures, which build upon the textual representation of
the lyrics; and musical features, which rely on the
musical notation associated with the songs. We run
three sets of experiments. The first one is intended to
determine the usefulness of the textual features for
593
emotion classification. The second set specifically
focuses on the musical features. Finally, the last set
of experiments makes joint use of textual and musi-
cal features.
The experiments are run using linear regression,2
and the results are evaluated by measuring the Pear-
son correlation between the classifier predictions
and the gold standard. For each experiment, a ten-
fold cross validation is run on the entire dataset.3
4.1 Textual Features
First, we attempt to identify the emotions in a line
by relying exclusively on the features that can be de-
rived from the lyrics of the song. We decided to fo-
cus on those features that were successfully used in
the past for emotion classification (Strapparava and
Mihalcea, 2008). Specifically, we use: (1) unigram
features obtained from a bag-of-words representa-
tion, which are the features typically used by corpus-
based methods; and (2) lexicon features, indicating
the appartenance of a word to a semantic class de-
fined in manually crafted lexicons, which are often
used by knowledge-based methods.
Unigrams. We use a bag-of-words representation
of the lyrics to derive unigram counts, which are
then used as input features. First, we build a vo-
cabulary consisting of all the words, including stop-
words, occurring in the lyrics of the training set. We
then remove those words that have a frequency be-
low 10 (value determined empirically on a small de-
velopment set). The remaining words represent the
unigram features, which are then associated with a
value corresponding to the frequency of the unigram
inside each line. Note that we also attempted to use
higher order n-grams (bigrams and trigrams), but
evaluations on a small development dataset did not
show any improvements over the unigram model,
and thus all the experiments are run using unigrams.
Semantic Classes. We also derive and use coarse
textual features, by using mappings between words
and semantic classes. Specifically, we use the Lin-
2We use the Weka machine learning toolkit.
3There is no clear way to determine a baseline for these
experiments. A simple baseline that we calculated, which as-
sumed by default an emotional score equal to the average of the
scores on the training data, and measured the correlation be-
tween these default scores and the gold standard, consistently
led to correlations close to 0 (0.0081-0.0221).
guistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Word-
Net Affect (WA) to derive coarse textual features.
LIWC was developed as a resource for psycholin-
guistic analysis (Pennebaker and Francis, 1999;
Pennebaker and King, 1999). The 2001 version of
LIWC includes about 2,200 words and word stems
grouped into about 70 broad categories relevant to
psychological processes (e.g., emotion, cognition).
WA (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) is a resource
that was created starting with WordNet, by annotat-
ing synsets with several emotions. It uses several re-
sources for affective information, including the emo-
tion classification of Ortony (Ortony et al., 1987).
From WA, we extract the words corresponding to
the six basic emotions used in our experiments. For
each semantic class, we infer a feature indicating the
number of words in a line belonging to that class.
Table 3 shows the Pearson correlations obtained
for each of the six emotions, when using only uni-
grams, only semantic classes, or both.

4.2 Musical Features.
In a second set of experiments, we explore the role
played by the musical features. While the musical
notation of a song offers several characteristics that
could be potentially useful for our classification ex-
periments (e.g., notes, measures, dynamics, tempo),
in these initial experiments we decided to focus on
two main features, namely the notes and the key.
Notes. A note is a sign used in the musical nota-
tion associated with a song, to represent the relative
duration and pitch of a sound. In traditional mu-
sic theory, the notes are represented using the first
seven letters of the alphabet (C-D-E-F-G-A-B), al-
594
though other notations can also be used. Notes can
be modified by “accidentals” – a sharp or a flat sym-
bol that can change the note by half a tone. A written
note can also have associated a value, which refers
to its duration (e.g., whole note; eighth note). Simi-
lar to the unigram features, for each note, we record
a feature indicating the frequency of that note inside
a line.
Key. The key of a song refers to the harmony or
“pitch class” used for a song, e.g., C major, or F#.
Sometime the term minor or major can be appended
to a key, to indicate a minor or a major scale. For
instance, a song in “the key of C minor” means that
the song is harmonically centered on the note C, and
it makes use of the minor scale whose first note is C.
The key system is the structural foundation of most
of the Western music. We use a simple feature that
reflects the key of the song. Note that with a few ex-
ceptions, when more than one key is used in a song,
all the lines in a song will have the same key.
Table 4 shows the results obtained in these clas-
sification experiments, when using only the notes as
features, only the key, or both.

4.3 Joint Textual and Musical Features.
To explore the usefulness of the joint lyrics and mu-
sic representation, we also run a set of experiments
that use all the textual and musical features. Table 5
shows the Pearson correlations obtained when us-
ing all the features. To facilitate the comparison,
the table also includes the results obtained with the
textual-only and musical-only features (reported in

tures.
5 Discussion
One clear conclusion can be drawn from these ex-
periments: the textual and musical features are both
useful for the classification of emotions in songs,
and, more importantly, their joint use leads to the
highest classification results. Specifically, the joint
model gives an error rate reduction of 12.9% with
respect to the classifier that uses only textual fea-
tures, and 31.2% with respect to the classifier that
uses only musical features. This supports the idea
that lyrics and music represent orthogonal dimen-
sions for the classification of emotions in songs.
Among the six emotions considered, the largest
improvements are observed for JOY, SADNESS, and
ANGER. This was somehow expected for the first
two emotions, since they appear to be dominant in
the corpus (see Table 2), but comes as a surprise
for ANGER, which is less dominant. Further explo-
rations are needed to determine the reason for this
effect.
Looking at the features considered, textual fea-
tures appear to be the most useful. Nonetheless,
the addition of the musical features brings clear im-
provements, as shown in the last column from the
same table.
Additionally, we made several further analyses of
the results, as described below.
Feature ablation. To determine the role played by
each of the feature groups we consider, we run an
ablation study where we remove one feature group
at a time from the complete set of features and mea-
sure the accuracy of the resulting classifier. Table 6
shows the feature ablation results. Note that feature
ablation can also be done in the reverse direction, by

The ablation studies confirm the findings from our
earlier experiments: while the unigrams and the keys
are the most predictive features, the semantic classes
and the notes are also contributing to the final clas-
sification even if to a lesser extent. To measure the
effect of these groups of somehow weaker features
(semantic classes and notes), we also perform an ab-
lation experiment where we remove both these fea-
ture groups from the feature set. The results are re-
ported in the last column of Table 6.
Coarse-grained classification. As an additional
evaluation, we transform the task into a binary clas-
sification by using a threshold empirically set at 3.
Thus, to generate the coarse binary annotations, if
the score of an emotion is below 3, we record it as
“negative” (i.e., the emotion is absent), whereas if
the score is equal to or above 3, we record it as “pos-
itive” (i.e., the emotion is present).
For the classification, we use Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVM), which are binary classifiers that seek
to find the hyperplane that best separates a set of pos-
itive examples from a set of negative examples, with
maximum margin (Vapnik, 1995). Applications of
SVM classifiers to text categorization led to some of
the best results reported in the literature (Joachims,
1998).
Table 7 shows the results obtained for each of the
six emotions, and for the three major settings that
we considered: textual features only, musical fea-
tures only, and a classifier that jointly uses the tex-
tual and the musical features. As before, the classi-
fication accuracy for each experiment is reported as
the average of the accuracies obtained during a ten-
fold cross-validation on the corpus. The table also
shows a baseline, computed as the average of the
accuracies obtained when using the most frequent
class observed on the training data for each fold.
As seen from the table, on average, the joint use of
textual and musical features is also beneficial for this
binary coarser-grained classification. Perhaps not
surprisingly, the effect of the classifier is stronger for

those emotions that are dominant in the corpus, i.e.,
JOY and SADNESS (see Table 2). The improvement
obtained with the classifiers is much smaller for the
other emotions (or even absent, e.g., for SURPRISE),
which is also explained by their high baseline of over
90%.
Comparison to previous work. There is no pre-
vious research that has considered the joint use of
lyrics and songs representations for emotion classifi-
cation at line level, and thus we cannot draw a direct
comparison with other work on emotion classifica-
tion in songs.
Nonetheless, as a point of reference, we consider
the previous work done on emotion classification of
texts. Table 8 shows the results obtained in previ-
ous work for the recognition of emotions in a corpus
consisting of 1,000 news headlines (Strapparava and
Mihalcea, 2007) annotated for the same six emo-
tions. Specifically, the table shows the best over-
all correlation results obtained by the three emotion
recognition systems in the SEMEVAL task on Affec-
tive Text (Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2007): (Chau-
martin, 2007; Kozareva et al., 2007; Katz et al.,
2007). The table also shows the best results obtained
in follow up work carried out on the same dataset
(Strapparava and Mihalcea, 2008).
Except for one emotion (FEAR), the correlation
figures we obtain are significantly higher than those
reported in previous work. As mentioned before,
however, a direct comparison cannot be made, since
the earlier work used a different, smaller dataset.
Moreover, our corpus of songs is likely to be more
emotionally loaded than the news titles used in pre-
vious work.
6 Conclusions
Popular songs express universally understood mean-
ings and embody experiences and feelings shared by
many, usually through a combined effect of both mu-
sic and lyrics. In this paper, we introduced a novel
corpus of music and lyrics, annotated for emotions at
line level, and we used this corpus to explore the au-
tomatic recognition of emotions in songs. Through
experiments carried out on the dataset of 100 songs,
we showed that emotion recognition can be per-
formed using either textual or musical features, and
that the joint use of lyrics and music can improve
significantly over classifiers that use only one di-
mension at a time.
The dataset introduced in this paper is available
by request from the authors of the paper.
