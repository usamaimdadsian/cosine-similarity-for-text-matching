Abstract
We present a new unsupervised mecha-
nism, which ranks word n-grams accord-
ing to their multiwordness. It heavily re-
lies on a new uniqueness measure that
computes, based on a distributional the-
saurus, how often an n-gram could be re-
placed in context by a single-worded term.
In addition with a downweighting mech-
anism for incomplete terms this forms a
new measure called DRUID. Results show
large improvements on two small test sets
over competitive baselines. We demon-
strate the scalability of the method to large
corpora, and the independence of the mea-
sure of shallow syntactic filtering.
1 Introduction
While it seems intuitive to treat certain sequences
of tokens as single terms, there is still consider-
able controversy about the definition of what ex-
actly such a multiword expression (MWE) con-
stitutes. Sag et al. (2001) pinpoint the need of
treating MWEs correctly and classify a range of
syntactic formations that could form MWEs and
define MWEs as being non-compositional with re-
spect to the meaning of their parts. While the exact
requirements on MWEs is bound to specific tasks
(such as parsing, keyword extraction, etc.), we op-
erationalize the notion of non-compositionality by
using distributional semantics and introduce a new
measure that works well for a range of task-based
MWE definitions.
Most previous MWE ranking approaches
use the following mechanisms to determine
multiwordness: part-of-speech (POS) tags,
word/multiword frequency and significance of
co-occurrence of the parts. In this paper we
do not want to introduce ”yet another ranking
function” but rather an additional mechanism,
which performs ranking based on distributional
semantics.
Distributional semantics has already been
used for MWE identification, but mainly to
discriminate between compositional and non-
compositional MWEs (Schone and Jurafsky,
2001; Salehi et al., 2014; Hermann and Blunsom,
2014). Here we introduce a new concept to de-
scribe the multiwordness of a term by its unique-
ness. Using the uniqueness score we measure
how likely a term in context can be replaced by
a single word. This measure is motivated by the
semiotic consideration that due to parsimony con-
cepts are often expressed as single words. Further-
more, we implement a context-aware punishment,
called incompleteness, which degrades the score
of terms that seem incomplete regarding their con-
texts. Both concepts are combined into a single
score we call DRUID, which is calculated based
on a distributional thesaurus. In the following, we
show the impact of that new method for French
and English and also examine the effect of cor-
pus size on MWE extraction. Additionally, we
report on results without using any linguistic pre-
processing except tokenization.
2 Related Work
The generation of MWE dictionaries has drawn
much attention in the field of Natural Lan-
guage Processing (NLP). Early computational
approaches (e.g. Justeson and Katz (1995)) use
POS sequences as MWE extractors. Other ap-
proaches, relying on word frequency, statistically
verify the hypothesis whether the parts of the
MWE occur more often together than would be
expected by chance (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999;
Evert, 2005; Ramisch, 2012). One of the first
measures that consider context information (co-
occurrences) are the C-value and the NC-value in-
troduced by Frantzi et al. (1998). These meth-
ods first extract candidates using POS information
2430
and then compute scores based on the frequency
of the MWE and the frequency of nested MWE
candidates. The method described by Wermter
and Hahn (2005) computes a score by multiplying
the frequency of a candidate when placing wild-
cards for each word. A newer method is intro-
duced in Lossio-Ventura et al. (2014), which re-
ranks scores based on an extension of the C-value,
which uses a POS-based probability and an inverse
document frequency. Using different measures
and learning a classifier that predicts the multi-
wordness was first proposed by Pecina (2010),
who, however, restricts his experiments to two-
word MWEs for the Czech language only. Ko-
rkontzelos (2010) comparatively evaluates several
MWE ranking measures. The best MWE extrac-
tor reported in his work is the scorer by (Naka-
gawa and Mori, 2002; Nakagawa and Mori, 2003),
who use the un-nested frequency (called marginal
frequency) of each candidate and multiply these
by the geometric mean of the distinct neighbor of
each word within the candidate.
Distributional semantics is mostly used to de-
tect compositionality of MWEs (Salehi et al.,
2014; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006). Most ap-
proaches therefore compare the context vector of
a MWE with the combined vectors based on the
constituent words of the MWE. The similarity be-
tween the vectors is then used as degree for com-
positionality. In machine translation, words are
sometimes considered as multiwords if they can
be translated as single term (cf. (Bouamor et al.,
2012; Anastasiou, 2010)). Whereas this follows
the same intuition as our uniqueness measure, we
do not require any bilingual corpora.
Regarding the evaluation, mostly precision at k
(P@k) and recall at k (R@k) are applied (e.g. (Ev-
ert, 2005; Frantzi et al., 1998; Lossio-Ventura et
al., 2014)). Another general approach is using the
average precision (AP), which is also used in In-
formation Retrieval (IR) (Thater et al., 2009) and
has also been applied by Ramisch et al. (2012).
3 Baselines and Previous Approaches
We will evaluate our method by comparing our
MWE ranking to multiword lists that have been
annotated in corpora. Here, we introduce an up-
per bound and two baseline methods and give a
brief description of the competitive methods used
in this paper. Most of these methods require a list
of candidate terms T , usually extracted with POS
sequences (see Section 5).
3.1 Upper Bound
We use a perfect ranking as upper bound, where
we rank all positive candidates before all negative
ones.
3.2 Lower Baseline and Frequency Baseline
The ratio between true candidates and all candi-
dates serves as lower baseline, which is also called
baseline precision (Evert, 2008). The second base-
line is the frequency baseline, which ranks can-
didate terms t ? T according to their frequency
freq(t).
3.3 C-value/NC-value
The commonly used C-value (see Eq. 1) was de-
veloped by Frantzi et al. (1998). The first fac-
tor, logarithm of the term length in words, favors
longer MWEs. The second factor is the frequency
of the term reduced by the average frequency of
all candidate terms T , which nest the term t, i.e. t
is a substring of the terms we denote as T
t
.
c(t) = log
2
(|t|)(freq(t)?
1
|T
t
|
?
b?T
t
freq(b))
(1)
An extension of the C-value was proposed by
Frantzi et al. (1998) as well and is named NC-
value. It takes advantage of context words C
t
by
assigning weights to them. As context words only
nouns, adjectives and verbs are considered
1
. Con-
text words are weighted with Equation 2, where
k denotes the number of times the context word
c ? C
t
occurs with any of the candidate terms.
This number is normalized by the number of can-
didate terms.
w(c) =
k
|T |
(2)
The NC-value is a weighted sum of the C-value
and the product of the term t occurring with each
context c which form the term t
c
:
nc(t) = 0.8 ? c(t) + 0.2

3.4 t-test
The t-test (see e.g. (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999,
p.163)) is a statistical test for the significance of
1

(1998)
2431
co-occurrence of two words. It relies on the proba-
bilities of the term and its single words. The prob-
ability of a word p(w) is defined as the frequency
of the term divided by the total number of terms
of the same length. The t-test statistic is computed
using Equation 4 with freq(.) being the total fre-
quency of unigrams.

(4)
We then use this score to rank the candidate terms.
3.5 FGM Score
Another method inspired by the C/NC-value is
proposed in (Nakagawa and Mori, 2002; Naka-
gawa and Mori, 2003). The method was developed
on a Japanese dataset and outperformed a modi-
fied C-value
2
measure. The method is composed
of two scoring mechanisms for the candidate term
t as shown in Equation 5.
FGM(t) = GM(t)×MF (t) (5)
The first term in the equation is a geometric mean
GM(.) of the number of distinct direct left l(.) and
right r(.) neighboring words for each single word
t
i
within t.
GM(t) =
2|t|
?
?
t
i
?t
(|l(t
i
)|+ 1)(|r(t
i
)|+ 1) (6)
The neighboring words are extracted directly from
the corpus; the method does neither rely on can-
didate lists nor POS tags. To the contrary, the
marginal frequency MF (t) relies on the candi-
date list and the underlying corpus. This frequency
counts how often the candidate term occurs within
the corpus and is not a subset of a candidate. In
Korkontzelos (2010) it was shown that while scor-
ing according to Equation 5 leads to comparatively
good results, it is consistently outperformed by
MF only.
4 Semantic Uniqueness and
Incompleteness
We present two new mechanisms relying on a Dis-
tributional Thesaurus (DT), which we use to rank
terms regarding their multiwordness: A score for
the uniqueness of a term and a punishing score that
conveys the incompleteness.
2
They adjust the logarithmic length in order to be able to
use the C-value to detect single worded terms.
4.1 Similarity Computation
The DT is computed based on Biemann and Riedl
(2013). First we extract n-grams from text and
consider the left and the right neighbor of each n-
gram as context feature. Then, we calculate the
Lexicographer’s Mutual Information (LMI) sig-
nificance score (Bordag, 2008) between n-grams
and features and remove all context features,
which co-occur with more than 1000 terms, as
these features tend to be to general. In the next
step we keep for each n-gram only the 1000 con-
text features, with the highest LMI score. The
similarity score is then computed based on the
overlap of features between two terms. Due to
pruning this overlap-based significance measure is
proportional to the Jaccard similarity measure, al-
beit we do not consider any normalization. After
computing the feature overlap between two terms,
we keep for each n-gram the 200 most similar n-
grams. An example for the most similar n-grams
to the terms red blood cell and red blood including
their feature overlap are shown in Table 1.
4.2 Uniqness Computation
The first mechanism of our MWE ranking method
is based on the following hypothesis: n-grams,
which are MWE, could be substituted by sin-
gle words, thus they have many single words
amongst their most similar terms. This is moti-
vated by semiotic considerations: Because of par-
simony, concepts are usually expressed in single
words. When a semantically non-compositional
word combination is added to the vocabulary, it
expresses a concept that is necessarily similar to
other concepts. Hence, if a candidate multiword is
similar to many single word terms, this indicates
multiwordness.
To compute the uniqueness score (uq) of an n-
gram t, we first extract the n-grams it is simi-
lar to using the DT as described in Section 4.1.
The function similarities(t) returns the 200 most
similar n-grams to the given n-gram t. We then
compute the ratio between unigrams and all simi-
lar n-grams considered using the formula:
uq(t) =
?
similarities(t)
s:|s|=1
1
|similarities(t)|
. (7)
We illustrate the computation of our measure
based on the MWE red blood cell and the non-
MWE red blood. When considering only the ten
most similar entries for both n-grams as illustrated
2432
in Figure 1, we observe an uniqueness score of
7/10 = 0.7 for both n-grams. If considering the
red blood cell red blood

Here, seven out of ten terms are single words.
top 200 similar n-grams, which are also used in
our experiments we will obtain 135 unigrams for
the candidate red blood cell and 100 unigrams for
the n-gram red blood. We will use these counts
for showing the workings of the method in the re-
mainder.
4.3 Incompleteness Computation
Similar to the C/NC-value method, we also as-
sign a context weighting function that punishes
incomplete terms, which we call incompleteness
(ic). For this function we extract the 1000 most
significant context features using the function
context(t), which yields tuples of left and right
contexts. These context features are the same that
are used for the similarity computation in Section
4.1 and have been ranked according to the LMI
measure. For the example term red blood, some of
the contexts are ?extravasated, cells?, ?uninfected,
cells?, ?nucleated, corpuscles?. In the next step
we split each tuple to its left and right word in-
cluding its relative position (left/right) to the can-
didate term. Using the first context feature results
in: ?extravasated, left?, ?cells, right?. Then, we
sum up the occurrences of for each single context,
as shown in Table 2 for the two terms.
We subsequently select the maximal count and
normalize it by the counts of features |context(t)|
considered, which is 1000. This results into the
incompleteness measure ic(t). For our example
terms we achieve the values ic(red blood) =
557/1000 and ic(red blood cell) = 48/1000.
Whereas the uniqueness scores for the most simi-
lar entries were equal, we now have a measure that
indicates the incompleteness of an n-gram, with
higher scores indicating more incomplete terms.

red blood
cells right 557
cell right 344
corpuscles right 13
Table 2: Top three most frequent context words
for the term red blood cell and red blood in the
Medline corpus.
4.4 Combining Both Measures
As shown in the previous two sections, a high
uniqueness score indicates the multiwordness and
a high incompleteness score should decrease the
overall score. In experiments, we found the best
combination if we subtract
3
the incompleteness
score from the uniqueness score. This mechanism
is inspired by the C-value and motivated as terms
that are often preceded/followed by the same word
do not cover the full multiword expression and
need to be downranked. This leads to Equation
8, which we call DistRibutional Uniqueness and
Incompleteness Degree:
DRUID(t) =uq(t)? ic(t). (8)
Applying the DRUID score to our example terms
(considering the 200 most similar terms) we will
achieve the scores DRUID(red blood cell) =
135/200 ? 48/1000 = 0.627 and
DRUID(red blood) = 100/200 ? 557/1000 =
?0.057. As a higher DRUID score indicates the
multiwordness of an n-gram, we can summarize
that the n-gram red blood cell is a better MWE
than the n-gram red blood.
5 Experimental Setting
We examine two experimental settings: First, we
compute all measures on a small corpus that has
been annotated for MWEs, which serves as the
gold standard. In the second setting we compute
the measures on a larger in-domain corpus. The
evaluation is again performed for the same candi-
date terms as given by the gold standard. Results
for the top k ranked entries are reported using the
precision at k (P@k =

with x

5.1 Corpora
For the experiments we consider two annotated
(small) corpora and two unannotated (large) cor-
pora.
5.1.1 GENIA corpus and SPMRL 2013:
French Treebank
In the first experiments we use two small anno-
tated corpora that serve the gold standard MWEs.
We use the medical GENIA corpus (Kim et al.,
2003)
4
which consists of 1999 abstracts from
Medline
5
and encompasses 0.4 million words.
This corpus has annotations regarding important
and biomedical terms. Also single terms are anno-
tated in this data set, which we ignore.
The second small corpus is based on the French
Treebank (Abeill´e and Barrier, 2004), which was
extended for the SPMRL task (Seddah et al.,
2013). This version of the corpus also contains
compounds annotated as MWEs. In our experi-
ments we use the training data, which covers 0.4
million words.
Whereas the GENIA MWEs target term match-
ing and medical information retrieval, the SPMRL
MWEs mainly focus on improving parsing
through compound recognition.
5.1.2 Medline Corpus and Est R
´
epublican
Corpus (ERC)
In a second experiment the scalability to larger
corpora is tested. For this, we make use of the en-
tire Medline
5
abstracts, which consist of about 1.1
billion words. The Est R´epublican Corpus (ERC)
(Seddah et al., 2012)
6
is our large French corpus.
It consists of local French news from the east-
ern part of France and comprises of 150 million
words.
5.2 Candidate Selection
In the first two experiments, we use POS filters
to select candidates. We concentrate on filters

that extract noun MWEs and avoid further pre-
processing like lemmatization. We use the filter
introduced by Justeson and Katz (1995)
7
for the
English medical datasets. Considering only terms
that appear more than ten times leads to 1,340 can-
didates for the GENIA dataset and 29,790 can-
didates for the Medline dataset. According to
Table 3 we observe that most candidates are bi-
grams. Whereas for both corpora still around 20%
of trigrams are contained, the number of 4-grams
is only marginally represented. For the French
datasets we apply the filter proposed by Daille
et al. (1994)
8
, which is suited to match nomi-
nal MWEs. Applying the same filtering as for
the medical corpora leads to 330 candidate terms
for the SPMRL and 7,365 candidate terms for the
ERC. Here the ratio between bi- and trigrams is
more balanced but again the number of 4-grams
constitutes the smallest class.

ERC 7,365 3,639 2,889 837
Table 3: Number of candidates after filtering for
the expected POS-tag and their distribution over
n-grams with n ? {1, 2, 3, 4}.
In comparison to the Medline dataset, the ratio
of multiwords extracted by the POS filter on the
French corpus is much lower. The reason for that
property is that in the French data, many adverbial,
prepositional MWEs are annotated, which are not
covered by the POS filter.
The third experiment shows the performance of
the method in absence of language-specific pre-
processing. Thus, we only filter the candidates by
frequency and do not make use of POS filtering.
As most previous methods rely on POS-filtered
data we cannot make use of them in this setting.
For the evaluation, we compute the scores of
the competitive methods in two settings: First, we
compute the scores based on the full candidate
list without any frequency filter and prune low-
frequent candidates only for the evaluation (post-
prune). In the second setting we filter candidates
7
A regular expression for matching POS tag se-
quences is summarized by Korkontzelos (2010):
(([JN]+[JN]?[NP]?[JN]?)N). Each letter is a
truncated POS tag of length one where J is an adjective N a
noun and P a preposition.
8
Following the same convention as for English the regular
expression can be expressed as N[J]?|NN|NPDN
2434
according to their frequency before the computa-
tion of scores (pre-prune). This leads to differ-
ences for context-aware measures, since in the pre-
pruned case, a lower number of less noisier con-
texts is used.
6 Results
6.1 Small Corpora Results
First we show the results based on the GENIA cor-
pus (see Table 4). Almost all competitive methods

beat the lower baseline. The C/NC-value perform
best when the pruning is done after a frequency
filter. In line with the findings of Korkontzelos
(2010) and in contrast to Frantzi et al. (1998) the
AP of the C-value is slightly higher than for the
NC-value. All the FGM based methods except the
GM measure alone outperform the C-value. The
results in Table 4 indicate that the best compet-
itive system is the post-pruned FGM system as
it has much higher average precision scores and
misses only 50 MWEs in the first 500 entries. A
slightly different picture is presented in Figure 1
where the P@k scores against the number of can-
didates are plotted. Here DRUID performs well
for the top-k list for small k, i.e. finds many good
MWEs with high confidence thus combines well
with MF, which extends to larger k, but places too
much importance of frequency when used alone.
Common errors are frequent chunks such as ”in
patience”, see Table 9 in Section 7. Whereas for
the post-pruned case FGM scores higher than MF,
the inverse is observed when pre-pruning. Us-
ing our DRUID methods can surmount the FGM
method only for the first 300 ranked terms (see
Figure 1 and Table 4). Multiplying the logarith-
mic frequency to the DRUID, the results improve

All FGM results are outperformed when combin-

According to Figure 1 this combination achieves
high precision for the first ranked candidates and
still exploits the good performance of the post-

candidates.
Different results are achieved for the SPMRL
dataset as can be seen in Table 5. Whereas the
pre-pruned C-value again receives better results
than frequency, it scores below the lower base-

Table 5: Results for the French SPMRL dataset
do not exceed the lower baseline. Data analysis
revealed that for the French dataset only ten out of
the 330 candidate terms are nested within any of
the candidates. This is much lower than the 637
terms nested in the 1340 candidate terms for the
GENIA dataset. As both the FGM-based methods
and the C/NC-value heavily rely on nested can-
didates, they cannot profit from the candidates of
this dataset and achieve similar scores as ordering
candidates according to frequency. Comparing the
2435
baselines to our scoring method, this time we ob-
tain the best result for DRUID without additional
factors. However, multiplying DRUID with MF or
log(frequency) still outperforms the other methods
and the baselines.
6.2 Large Corpora Results
Most MWE evaluations have been performed on
rather small corpora. Here we want to inspect the
performance of the measures for large corpora, so
as to realistically simulate a situation where the
MWEs should be found automatically for an entire
domain.
Using the Medline corpus, all methods except
the GM score outperform the lower baseline and
the frequency baseline (see Table 6). Regarding

the AP the best results are obtained when combin-
ing our DRUID method with the MF, whereas for
P@100 and P@500 the log-frequency weighted
DRUID scores best. Using solely the DRUID
method or the combined variation with the log-
frequency lead to the best ranking for the first
1000 ranked candidates and is then outperformed
by the MF based DRUID variations. In this exper-
iment the C-value achieves the best performance
from the competitive methods for the P@100 and
P@500, followed by the t-test. But the highest
AP is reached with the post-pruned MF method,
which also outperforms the sole DRUID slightly.
Contrary to the GENIA results, the MF scores are
consistently higher than the FGM scores.
When using the French ERC we figured out that
no nested terms are found within the candidates.
Thus, the post- and pre-pruned settings are equiv-
alent and thus MF equals frequency. The best re-
sults are again obtained with our method with and
without the logarithmic frequency weighting (see
Table 7). Again the AP of the C-value and most

of the FGM-based methods are inferior to the fre-
quency scoring. Only the t-test and the MF are
slightly higher than the frequency
9
. But in con-
trast to the results based on the smaller SPMRL
dataset, the MF, FGM and C-value can outperform
the lower baseline. In comparison to the smaller
corpora, the performance for the larger corpora
is much lower. Especially low-frequent terms in
the small corpora that have high frequencies in the
larger corpora have not been annotated as MWEs.
6.3 Results without POS Filtering
In the last experiment, we apply our method to
candidates without any POS filtering and report
results using a frequency threshold of ten. As
the competitive methods from the previous section
rely on POS tags, we use the t-test for compari-
son. Analysis revealed that the top-scored candi-

dates according to the t-test begin with stop words.

This is achieved by chance for the MF, as it is equal to
the frequency. The different scores are due to the randomly
sorted tied scores used during our evaluation and reflect the
variance of the randomness.
2436
As an additional heuristic for the t-test, we shift
MWEs, which start or end with one of the ten most
frequent words, to the last ranks. For the smaller
dataset the best results are achieved with the sole
DRUID (see Table 8) and the frequency weight-
ing does not seem to be beneficial, as highly fre-
quent n-grams ending with stopwords are ranked
higher in absence of POS filtering. This, how-
ever, is not observed for larger corpora. Here
the best results for Medline are achieved with the
frequency weighted DRUID. Whereas for French,
the sole DRUID method performs best, the differ-
ence between the DRUID and the log-frequency-
weighted DRUID is rather small. The low APs
throughout can be explained by the large number
of considered candidates. The second best scores
are achieved with stop word based t-test (t-test +
sw). C-value performs en par with frequency.
6.4 Components of DRUID
Here, we show different parameters for DRUID,
relying on the English GENIA dataset without
POS filtering of MWE candidates and by consid-
ering only terms with a frequency of 10 or more.
Inspecting the two different components of the
DRUID measure (see upper graph in Figure 2), we
observe that the uniqueness measure contributes
most to the DRUID score. The main effect of the
incompleteness component is the downranking of
a rather small number of terms with high unique-
ness scores, which improves the overall ranking.
We can also see that for the top ranked terms the
negative incompleteness score does not improve
over the frequency baseline but outperforms the
frequency in the middle ranked candidates. Used
in DRUID we observe a slight improvement for
the complete ranking. We achieve a P@500 of
0.474 for the uniqueness scoring and 0.498 for the
DRUID score.
When filtering similar entries, used for the
uq scoring, by their similarity score (see bottom
graph in Figure 2), we observe that the amount of
similar n-grams considered seems to be more im-
portant then the quality of the similar entries: With
the increasing filtering also the quality of extracted
candidate MWEs diminishes.
7 Discussion and Data Analysis
The experiments confirm that our DRUID mea-
sure, either weighted with the MF or alone, works
best across two languages and across different cor-

pus sizes. It also achieves the best results in ab-
sence of POS filtering for candidate term extrac-
tion. The optimal weighting of DRUID depends
on the nestedness of the MWEs: Using DRUID
with the MF should be used when there are more
than 20% of nested candidates and using the log-
frequency or no frequency weighting when there
are almost no nested candidate terms.
We show the best-ranked candidates obtained
with our method and with the best competitive
method in terms of P@100 for the two smaller
corpora. Using the GENIA dataset, our log-
frequency based DRUID (see left column in Table
9) ranks only true MWE within the 15 top-scored
candidates.
The right-hand side shows results extracted with
the pre-pruned MF method that yields three non-
MWE terms. Whereas that could be a POS error,

the MF and also the C-value are not capable to re-
move terms starting with stop words. The DRUID
score alleviates this problem with the uniqueness
factor. For the French dataset our method ranks
only one false candidate whereas the MF (post-
pruned) ranks eight non-annotated candidates in
the top 15 list (see Table 10).

dataset for the best DRUID method (left) and the
best competitive method (right). Each term is
marked, if it is an MWE (1) or not (0).
Whereas the unweighted DRUID method scores
better than its competitors on the large corpora,
the best results are achieved when using DRUID
with frequency-based weights on the smaller cor-
pora. For a direct comparison we evaluated the
small and large corpora using an equal candidate
set. We observed that all methods computed on
the large corpora achieve slightly inferior results
than when computing them using the small cor-
pora. Data analysis revealed that we would con-
sider many of the high ranked ”false” candidates
as MWE.
Therefore we extracted the top ten ranked terms,
which are not annotated as MWE from the meth-
ods with the best P@100 performance, resulting to
the log(freq) DRUID and the pre-pruned C-value
methods.
First, we observed that the first ’false’ candidate
for our method appears at rank 26 and at rank 1 for
the C-value. Additionally, only ten out of the top
74 candidates are not annotated as MWEs for our
method and 48 for the competitor. When search-
ing the terms within the MeSH dictionary
10
, we
find seven terms ranked from our method and two
for the competitive method.
8 Conclusion
Uniqueness is a new mechanism in MWE model-
ing. Whereas frequency and co-occurrence have
been captured in many previous approaches (see
Manning and Sch¨utze (1999), Ramisch et al.
(2012) and Korkontzelos (2010) for a survey), we
boost multiword candidates t by their grade of dis-
tributional similarity with single word terms. We
implement such contextual substitutability with a
model where the term t can consist of multiword
tokens and similarity is measured based on the
right and neighboring word between all (single
and multiword) terms. Since it is the default to ex-
press concepts with single words, a high unique-
ness score is given to multiwords that belong to
a category just as single words would. E.g. for
an English open-domain corpus hot dog is most
similar to the terms: food, burger, hamburger,
sausage and roadside. Candidates with a low
number of single word similarities also serve the
same function, but more frequently we observe
single n-grams with function words or modifying
adjectives concatenated with content words, i.e.
small dog is most similar to ”various cat”, ”large
amount of ”, ”large dog”, ”certain dog”, ”dog”. To
be able to kick in, the measure requires a certain
minimum frequency for candidates in order to find
enough contextual overlap with other terms. Ad-
ditionally, we also demonstrate effective perfor-
mance on larger corpora and show its applicability
when used in a complete unsupervised evaluation
setting.
