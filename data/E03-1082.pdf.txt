Abstract
This paper presents a multilingual system
designed to recognize named entities in a
wide variety of languages (currently more
than 12 languages are concerned). The
system includes original strategies to deal
with a wide variety of encoding character
sets, analysis strategies and algorithms to
process these languages.
1 Introduction
Since the MUC conferences about Information
Extraction, named entity recognition (NERC) is
a well-established task in the NLP community
(MUC-6, 1995). Examples of named entities are
person names, location and company names,
date and time indications, etc. A lot of systems
have been developed to perform this task,
ranging from manually created rule-based
systems to fully automatic learning-based
systems. We will shortly present these
technologies below.'
Even if a lot of systems have been developed
for languages such as English or Japanese, a
large range of languages do not have access to
such a technology. We propose an open
framework to develop resources and tools for
named entity recognition. A team of
computational linguist students develops this

projecti, so that it also has pedagogic purposes.
But, even so, the project seems to be sufficiently
attractive to interest industrial partners.
We describe the different approaches for
named entity recognition. We then present the
project and the different analysis techniques
used. We will conclude with some
considerations on evaluation and future work.
2 State of the art NERC systems
In this section, we examine the different
approaches to named entity recognition. We
then examine previous experiments to compare
systems and techniques. Sekine and Eriguchi
(2000) present an interesting classification of
named entity recognition systems.
• Manually created rule-based systems. In
this kind of system, developers initially
elaborate a set of patterns that will be applied on
the text to accurately recognize and tag named
entities. Nearly all classical MUC systems were
using this approach until the mid' 90s, and most
of them are still using this kind of technique
(MUC-6, 1995).
• Fully automatic learning-based systems.
These systems are using Machine Learning
(ML) techniques to learn a model in order to
accurately tag the texts. The result of the
learning task can be a set of rules, a decision tree
or a set of numeric data. Note that a human
cannot always revise the result if the learning
algorithm used does not provide a readable
output. These systems are now very popular in
the IE community (Bikel et al., 1997) (Collins
and Singer, 1999), even if they were initially
rather dedicated to audio corpora.

• Mixed approach. In this kind of systems, a
set of rules is automatically learned and revised
by an expert. An alternative can be the dynamic
extension of an existing set of core rules
previously defined by the expert, so that the
system obtains a better coverage of the data.
Cucchiarelli and Velardi (2000), among others,
have applied this approach to NERC systems.
3 Multilingual named entity
recognition
We are currently developing resources and tools
for the following languages: Arabic, Chinese,
English, French, German, Japanese, Finnish,
Malagasy, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish and
Swedish.
3.1 Multilingualism issues
These languages vary a lot in their
characteristics, in their writing systems as much
as in their grammar. Moreover, language
technology is not much developed for most of
them. This has a big consequence for named
entity recognition: for certain languages like
most of the European languages, we benefit
from already existing lexical resources. For
other languages, a lot of work still needs to be
done. For example, there is no dictionary
available for Malagasy and even electronic
resources and corpora are rare.
All the texts and resources are encoded using
the Unicode standard (Unicode Little-Endian).
This strategy allows most of the encoding
problems to be solved, even if some bugs still
remain from time to time for a given language
(for example, writing direction problems in
Arabic, when characters appears from the left to
the right, while it should be the contrary, etc.).
3.2 Overall system architecture
In spite of differences in their implementation,
each system shares approximately the same
architecture. The text is firstly analyzed by a
classical rule-based system. This analysis is then
completed by dynamic acquisition mechanisms
(theory learning) and revision capabilities (see
Figure 1).
Figure 1: Architecture of the system
We detail below these 4 main knowledge
sources:
•
Gazetteers. Their role is disputed since the
appearance of ML techniques allowing
previously unknown named entities to be
acquired from tagged corpora. However, it is
simply, most of the time, not realistic to tag
large amount of corpus (Appelt and Israel,
1999). Moreover, tagging great amounts of data
can be compared to the elaboration of
dictionaries2 .
• Grammar. Its aim is to group together
elements pertaining to the same entity. A
grammar rule is generally made of a trigger
word, some tagged words and occasionally
unknown words. These words can be accurately
tagged given an appropriate context (especially
if a trigger word disambiguates the sequence).
• Learning capabilities. We include, in this
section, ML algorithms used to tag unknown
named entities. Most ML techniques have been

easy to write a simple program that will
automatically extract the sequences previously
tagged to generate a dictionary. In this sense, tagging
is not that different from elaborating a dictionary!

used including maximal entropy, inductive logic
programming, decision tree learning, hidden
Markov models and others (Bechet et al., 2000)
(Bikel et al., 1997) (Collins and Singer, 1999)
(Mikheev et al., 1999). We use a kind of theory
learning to extend the set of expressions
identified by the rule-based system: the lexicon
and the grammar is exploited as a domain theory
to dynamically find new entities (Mooney,
1993).
• Revision capabilities. We implemented
revision capabilities in the system so that it can
revise tags in a certain context. For example, in
an English text, isolated occurrences of
Washington can be considered as location
names. If one finds a context that potentially
suggests another category for the named entity
(for example, Mrs. Washington) the system will
revise the initial tag and put the new category on
the concerned word (isolated occurrences of
Washington will be tagged as person names).
3.3 Implementation
Rule-based systems have been developed for
English and French using the INTEx/UNITEx
finite state toolbox (Silberztein, 1993). The
resulting system has been described in (Poibeau
and Kosseim, 2001). Resources are currently
being defined and adapted to other languages
like Russian (Cyrillic alphabet) or Arabic and
Persian (Arabic writing system).
For Asian languages, like Japanese, which
makes use of 4 different writing systems
(hiragana, katakana, kanji and romanji), the
INTEx/UNITEx was not efficient. Thus, Japanese
is processed at first by the CHASEN
morphological analyser (Asahara and
Matsumoto, 2000). Perl scripts are then applied
on top of the CHASEN analysis to produce a
tagged text with highlighted named entities.
Even if the CHASEN analyser uses the JIS
format, the final output is encoded using the
Unicode standard.
Once the system is adapted, the same
strategy is adapted to the different languages. A
set of trigger words is defined, along with a
proper names dictionary and a named entity
grammar for the concerned language. The
dynamic named acquisition mechanisms
implemented are classical and have been
described with details in (Poibeau and Kosseim,
2001).
3.4 Resource sharing
While developing the system for different Indo-
European language, we saw that resources could
be shared by different languages. For example,
proper name dictionaries for French and English
are very similar. One has just to remove entries
from the English dictionary that would be too
ambiguous in French. A large part of the
grammar can also be re-used provided that the
grammar rules are carefully cheked and
appropriate modifications are made (list of
trigger words, etc.). Of course, these resources
must be completed to properly cover the new
language and/or the new domain.
The same approach seems to be valid for
other romance languages (Italian, Spanish). For
Germanic and Slavic languages, dictionaries
must be modified to take into account
inflectional forms. A large amount of work is
then needed to modify and adapt dictionaries
firstly developed for English (add an inflectional
code on each word; This code is language-
dependent). The approach has not been
investigated for non Indo-European languages.
4 Evaluation
The system is under implementation. A
complete evaluation is then impossible but we
present in this section some first results.
4.1 Overall performances
For the moment, only the English and the
French systems have been intensively tested.
Their performance is comparable to systems
having participated to MUC conferences (P&R
is the combined value of precision and recall).

Figure 2: Performances on the MUC-6 corpus
Their performance has also been tested on
different corpora and it appears that these hybrid
systems are less sensitive to corpus or domain
changes than classical rule-based systems
(Poibeau and Kosseim, 2001).
4.2 Other experiments
The developed systems are systematically tested
on the Monde Diplomatique corpus (when
available!), a multilingual international journal
published in 10 languages on the web. We hope
to achieve for most of the other languages under
implementation better or similar results to the
ones obtained for French and English. This
multilingual named entity recogniser is already
used in a wider project concerning corpus
alignment. The idea is to use cognates and
named entities as cues for sentence alignment.
5 Conclusion
This paper presented a multilingual framework
for named entity recognition. More than 12
languages are currently under development with
very encouraging results. This project will
produce stand-alone applications as well as
modules for sentence alignment and cognate
identification in parallel corpora using different
character sets and writing systems.
