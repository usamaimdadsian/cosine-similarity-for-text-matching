Abstract
This paper introduces ASTD, an Arabic
social sentiment analysis dataset gathered
from Twitter. It consists of about 10,000
tweets which are classified as objective,
subjective positive, subjective negative,
and subjective mixed. We present the
properties and the statistics of the dataset,
and run experiments using standard par-
titioning of the dataset. Our experiments
provide benchmark results for 4 way sen-
timent classification on the dataset.
1 Introduction
Arabic sentiment analysis work is gaining large at-
tention nowadays. This is mainly due to the need
of a product that can utilize natural language pro-
cessing technology to track and analyze the public
mood through processing social data streams. This
calls for using standard social sentiment analysis
datasets. In this work we present ASTD (Arabic
Sentiment Tweets Dataset) an Arabic social sen-
timent analysis dataset gathered from Twitter. We
discuss our method for gathering and annotating
the dataset, and present its properties and statis-
tics through the following tasks: (1) 4 way sen-
timent classification (2) Two stage class classifi-
cation; and (3) sentiment lexicon generation. The
contributions in this work can be summarized as:
1. We present an Arabic social dataset of about
10k tweets for subjectivity and sentiment
analysis gathered from.
2. We investigate the properties and the statis-
tics of the dataset and provide standard splits
for balanced and unbalanced settings of the
dataset.
3. We present a set of benchmark experiments
to the dataset to establish a baseline for future
comparisons.
4. We make the dataset and the used experi-
ments publicly available

2 Related Work
The detection of user sentiment in texts is a re-
cent task in natural language processing. This
task is gaining a large attention nowadays due to
the explosion in the number of social media plat-
forms and the number of people using them. Some
Arabic sentiment datasets have been collected
(see Table 1). (Abdul-Mageed et al., 2014) pro-
posed the SAMAR system that perform subjectiv-
ity and sentiment analysis for Arabic social media
where they used different multi-domain datasets
collected from Wikipedia TalkPages, Twitter, and
Arabic forums. (Aly and Atiya, 2013) proposed
LABR, a book reviews dataset collected from
GoodReads. (Rushdi-Saleh et al., 2011) presented
an Arabic corpus of 500 movie reviews collected
from different web pages. (Refaee and Rieser,
2014) presented a manually annotated Arabic so-
cial corpus of 8,868 Tweets and they discussed
the method of collecting and annotating the cor-
pus. (Abdul-Mageed and Diab, 2014) proposed
SANA, a large-scale, multi-domain, and multi-
genre Arabic sentiment lexicon. The lexicon au-
tomatically extends two manually collected lex-
icons HUDA (4,905 entries) and SIFFAT (3,325
entries). (Ibrahim et al., 2015) built a manual cor-
pus of 1,000 tweets and 1000 microblogs and used
it for sentiment analysis task. (ElSahar and El-
Beltagy, 2015) introduced four datasets in their
work to build a multi-domain Arabic resource
(sentiment lexicon). (Nabil et al., 2014) and (El-
Sahar and El-Beltagy, 2015) proposed a semi-
supervised method for building a sentiment lexi-
con that can be used efficiently in sentiment anal-
ysis.

3 Twitter Dataset
3.1 Dataset Collection
We have collected over 84,000 Arabic tweets. We
downloaded the tweets over two stages: In the
first stage we used SocialBakers
2
to determine the
most active Egyptian Twitter accounts. This gave
us a list of 30 names. We got the recent tweets
of these accounts till November 2013, and this
amounted to about 36,000. In the second stage we
crawled EgyptTrends
3
, a Twitter page for the top
trending hash tags in Egypt. We got about 2500
distinct hash tags which are used again to down-
load the tweets. We ended up obtaining about
48,000 tweets. After filtering out the non-Arabic
tweets, and performing some pre-processing steps
to clean up unwanted content like HTML, we
ended up with 54,716 Arabic tweets.
3.2 Dataset Annotation
We used Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) ser-
vice to manually annotate the data set through an

. We used four tags: objective,
subjective positive, subjective negative, and sub-
jective mixed. The tweets that are assigned the
same rating from at least two raters were consid-
ered as conflict free and are accepted for further
processing. Other tweets that have conflict from
all the three raters were ignored. We were able to
label around 10k tweets. Table 2 summarizes the
statistics for the conflict free ratings tweets.
3.3 Dataset Properties
The dataset has 10,006 tweets. Table 2 contains
some statistics gathered from the dataset. The his-
togram of the class categories is shown in Fig. 1,

where we notice the unbalance in the dataset, with
much more objective tweets than positive, nega-
tive, or mixed. Fig. 2 shows some examples from
the data set, including positive, negative, mixed
,and objective tweets.
4 Dataset Experiments
In this work, we performed a standard partition-
ing to the dataset then we used it for the sentiment
polarity classification problem using a wide range
of standard classifiers to perform 4 way sentiment
classification.
4.1 Data Preparation
We partitioned the data into training, validation
and test sets. The validation set is used as a mini-
test for evaluating and comparing models for pos-
sible inclusion into the final model. The ratio of
the data among these three sets is 6:2:2 respec-
tively.
Fig. 4 and Table 4 show the number of tweets
for each class category in the training, test, and
validation sets for both the balanced and unbal-
anced settings. Fig. 3 also shows the number of
n-gram counts for both the balanced and unbal-
anced settings.
4.2 4 Way Sentiment Classification
We explore using the dataset for the same set of ex-
periments presented in (Nabil et al., 2014) by ap-

plying a wide range of standard classifiers on the
balanced and unbalanced settings of the dataset.
The experiment is applied on both the token counts
and the Tf-Idf (token frequency inverse document
frequency) of the n-grams. Also we used the
same accuracy measures for evaluating our results
which are the weighted accuracy and the weighted
F1 measure.
Table 5 shows the result for each classifier after
training on both the training and the validation set
and evaluating the result on the test set (i.e. the
train:test ratio is 8:2). Each cell has numbers that
represent weighted accuracy / F1 measure where
the evaluation is performed on the test set. All
the experiments were implemented in Python us-
ing Scikit Learn
5
. Also the experiments were per-
formed on a machine with Intel® Core™ i5-4440

From table 5 we can make the following obser-
vations:
1. The 4 way sentiment classification task is
more challenging than the 3 way sentiment
classification task. This is to be expected,
since we are dealing with four classes in the
former, as opposed to only three in the latter.
2. The balanced set is more challenging than
the unbalanced set for the classification task.
We believe that this because the the balanced
set contains much fewer tweets compared to
the unbalanced set. Since having fewer train-
ing examples create data sparsity for many n-
grams and may therefore leads to less reliable
classification.
3. SVM is the best classifier and this is consis-
tent with previous results in (Aly and Atiya,
2013) suggesting that the SVM is reliable
choice.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper we presented ASTD an Arabic social
sentiment analysis dataset gathered from twitter.
We presented our method of collecting and anno-
tating the dataset. We investigated the properties
and the statistics of the dataset and performed two
set of benchmark experiments: (1) 4 way senti-
ment classification; (2) Two stage classification.
Also we constructed a seed sentiment lexicon from
the dataset. Our planned next steps include:
1. Increase the size of the dataset.
2. Discuss the issue of unbalanced dataset and
text classification.
3. Extend the generated method either auto-
mated or manually.
