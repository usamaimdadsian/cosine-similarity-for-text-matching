Abstract
A popular tradition of studying semantic rep-
resentation has been driven by the assump-
tion that word meaning can be learned from
the linguistic environment, despite ample ev-
idence suggesting that language is grounded
in perception and action. In this paper we
present a comparative study of models that
represent word meaning based on linguistic
and perceptual data. Linguistic information is
approximated by naturally occurring corpora
and sensorimotor experience by feature norms
(i.e., attributes native speakers consider impor-
tant in describing the meaning of a word). The
models differ in terms of the mechanisms by
which they integrate the two modalities. Ex-
perimental results show that a closer corre-
spondence to human data can be obtained by
uncovering latent information shared among
the textual and perceptual modalities rather
than arriving at semantic knowledge by con-
catenating the two.
1 Introduction
Distributional models of lexical semantics have seen
considerable success at accounting for a wide range
of behavioral data in tasks involving semantic cog-
nition (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Griffiths et
al., 2007). These models have also enjoyed last-
ing popularity in natural language processing. Ex-
amples involve information retrieval (Salton et al.,
1975), word sense discrimination (Schu¨tze, 1998),
text segmentation (Choi et al., 2001), and numerous
studies of lexicon acquisition (Grefenstette, 1994;
Lin, 1998). Despite their widespread use, distribu-
tional models have been criticized as “disembodied”
in that they learn exclusively from linguistic infor-
mation but are not grounded in perception and ac-
tion (Perfetti, 1998; Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg and
Kaschak, 2002).
This lack of grounding contrasts with many ex-
perimental studies suggesting that word meaning is
acquired not only from exposure to the linguistic
environment but also from our interaction with the
physical world (Landau et al., 1998; Bornstein et al.,
2004). Beyond language acquisition, there is consid-
erable evidence across both behavioral experiments
and neuroimaging studies that the perceptual asso-
ciates of words play an important role in language
processing (for a review see Barsalou (2008)).
It is thus no surprise that recent years have wit-
nessed the emergence of perceptually grounded dis-
tributional models. An important question in the for-
mulation of such models concerns the provenance
of perceptual information. A few models use fea-
ture norms as a proxy for sensorimotor experience
(Howell et al., 2005; Andrews et al., 2009; Steyvers,
2010; Johns and Jones, 2012). These are obtained
by asking native speakers to write down attributes
they consider important in describing the meaning
of a word. The attributes represent perceived phys-
ical and functional properties associated with the
referents of words. For example, apples are typi-
cally green or red, round, shiny, smooth, crunchy,
tasty, and so on; dogs have four legs and bark,
whereas chairs are used for sitting. Other models fo-
cus solely on the visual modality under the assump-
tion that it represents a major source of data from
1423
which humans can learn semantic representations
of both linguistic and non-linguistic communicative
actions (Regier, 1996). For example, Feng and Lap-
ata (2010) learn semantic representations from cor-
pora of texts paired with naturally co-occurring im-
ages (e.g., news articles and their associated pic-
tures), whereas Bruni et al. (2011) learn textual and
visual representations independently from distinct
data sources.
Aside from the type of data used to capture per-
ceptual information, another important issue con-
cerns how the two modalities (perceptual and tex-
tual) are integrated. A simple solution would be
to learn both modalities independently (Bruni et al.,
2011) or to infer one modality by means of the other
(Johns and Jones, 2012) and to arrive at a grounded
representation simply by concatenating the two. An
alternative is to learn from both modalities jointly
(Andrews et al., 2009; Feng and Lapata, 2010;
Steyvers, 2010). According to this view, seman-
tic knowledge is gained by simultaneously learning
from the statistical structure within each modality
assuming both data sources have been generated by
a shared set of meanings or topics.
In this paper we undertake the first comparative
study of perceptually grounded distributional mod-
els. We examine three models with different as-
sumptions regarding the integration of perceptual
and linguistic data. The first model, originally pro-
posed by Andrews et al. (2009), is an extension of
latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA, Blei et al. (2003)).
It simultaneously considers the distribution of words
across contexts in a text corpus and the distribu-
tion of words across perceptual features and extracts
joint information from both data sources. Our sec-
ond model is based on Johns and Jones (2012) who
represent the meaning of a word as the concatena-
tion of its textual and its perceptual vector. Interest-
ingly, their model allows to infer a perceptual vector
for words without feature norms, simply by taking
into account similar words for which perceptual in-
formation is available.
Finally, we propose Canonical Correlation Anal-
ysis (Hotelling, 1936; Hardoon et al., 2004) as our
third model. CCA is a data analysis and dimen-
sionality reduction method similar to PCA. While
PCA deals with only one data space, CCA is a tech-
nique for joint dimensionality reduction across two

(or more) spaces that provide heterogeneous repre-
sentations of the same objects. The assumption is
that the representations in these two spaces contain
some joint information that is reflected in correla-
tions between them.
In all three models we use feature norms as a
proxy for perceptual information. Despite their
shortcomings (e.g., they often cover a small frac-
tion of the vocabulary of an adult speaker due to
the effort involved in eliciting them), feature norms
provide detailed knowledge about meaning repre-
sentations and are a useful starting point for study-
ing the integration of perceptual and textual infor-
mation without being susceptible to the effects of
noise, e.g., coming from image processing. In other
words, feature norms can serve as an upper bound
of what can be achieved when integrating detailed
perceptual information with vanilla text-based dis-
tributional models.
Our experimental results demonstrate that joint
models give a better fit to human word similarity and
association data than a model that considers only
one data source, or the simple concatenation of the
two sources.
2 Perceptually Grounded Models
In this study we examine semantic representation
models that rely on linguistic and perceptual data.
The linguistic environment is approximated by cor-
pora such as the British National Corpus (BNC).
As mentioned earlier, we resort to feature norms
as proxy for perceptual information. In our exper-
iments, we relied on the norming study of McRae et
al. (2005), in which a large number of human par-
ticipants were presented with a series of words and
1424
asked to list relevant features of the words’ refer-
ents. Table 1 presents examples of features partici-
pants listed for the nouns apple, dog, and table. The
number of participants listing a certain feature for a
word can be used to compute a probability distribu-
tion over features given the word:
P( fk|w) =
f ( fk,w)
F
?
m=1
f ( fm,w)
(1)
where f ( fk,w) is the number of participants who
listed feature fk for word w and F is the total number
of features.
In the remainder of this section we will describe
our models and how they arrive at an integrated per-
ceptual and linguistic representation.
2.1 Feature-topic Model
Andrews et al. (2009) present an extension of LDA
(Blei et al., 2003) where words in documents as well
as their associated features are treated as observed
variables that are explained by a generative process.
The underlying training data consists of a corpus D
where each document is represented by words and
their frequency of occurrence within the document.
In addition, those words of a document that are also
included in the feature norms are paired with one of
their features, where a feature is sampled according
to the feature distribution given that word. For ex-
ample, suppose a document d j consists of the sen-
tence Mix in the apple, celery, raisins, and apple
juice. Suppose further that all content words ex-
cept of mix and juice are included in the feature
norms. Then, a representation for d j is mix:1, ap-
ple;is red:2, celery;has leaves:1, raisin;is edible:1,
juice:1.
The plate diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the
graphical model in detail. Each document d j
in D is generated by a mixture of components
{x1, ...,xc, ...,xC} ? C ; a component xc comprises a
latent discourse topic coupled with a feature clus-
ter originating from the feature norms. A dis-
course topic belonging to xc, in turn, is a distribu-
tion ?c ? ?= {?1, ...,?C} over words, and a feature
cluster is a distribution ?c ? ?= {?1, ...,?C} over
features.
In order to create document d j, a distribution pi j
over components is sampled from a Dirichlet distri-
pi

bution parametrized by ?. To generate each word
w ji ? {w j1, ...,w jn j}, a component xc = x ji is drawn
from pi j; w ji is then drawn from the corresponding
distribution ?c. If w ji is in the feature norms, it is
coupled with a feature f ji which is correspondingly
drawn from ?c. A symmetric Dirichlet prior with
hyperparameters ? and ? is placed on ? and ?, re-
spectively. The probability of the corpus D is de-
fined as:
P((w? f )1:D|?,?,?) =

P(w ji|x ji = xc,?)P( f ji|x ji = xc,?)P(x ji = xc|pi j)
(2)
where D is the number of documents and C the
predefined number of components. Computing the
posterior distribution P(?,?,?,?,?|(w ? f )1:D) of
the hidden variables given the data is generally in-
tractable:
P(?,?,?,?,?|(w? f )1:D) ? P((w? f )1:D|?,?,?)
P(?|?)P(?|?)P(?)P(?)P(?)

sampling procedure described in Andrews et al.
(2009).
Inducing feature-topic components from a docu-
ment collection D with the extended LDA model
just described gives two sets of parameters: word
probabilities given components PW (wi|X = xc) for
wi, i = 1, ...,N, and feature probabilities given com-
ponents PF( fk|X = xc) for fk, k= 1, ...,F . For exam-
ple, most of the probability mass of component x107
would be reserved for the words apple, fruit, lemon,
orange, tree and the features is red, tastes sweet,
is round and so on.
Word meaning in this model is represented by the
distribution PX |W over the learned components (see
Figure 2 for an example). Assuming a uniform dis-
tribution over components xc in D , PX |W can be ap-
proximated as:
PX=xc|W=wi =
P(wi|xc)P(xc)
P(wi)
?
P(wi|xc)
C
?
l=1
P(wi|xl)
(4)
where C is the total number of components. The
model can be also used to infer features for words
that were not originally included in the feature
norms. The probability distribution PF |W over fea-
tures given a word wi is simply inferred by summing
over all components xc for each feature fk:
PF( fk|W = wi) =
C
?
c=1
P( fk|xc)P(xc|wi) (5)
2.2 Global Similarity Model
Johns and Jones (2012) propose an approach for
generating perceptual representations for words by
means of global lexical similarity. Their model does
not place so much emphasis on the integration of
perceptual and linguistic information, rather its main
focus is on inducing perceptual representations for
words with no perceptual correlates. Their idea is to
assume that lexically similar words also share per-
ceptual features and hence it should be possible to
transfer perceptual information onto words that have
none from their linguistically similar neighbors.
Let T ? {1,0}N×D denote a binary term-
document matrix, where each cell records the pres-
ence or absence of a term in a document. Let
P ? [0,1]N×F denote a perceptual matrix, represent-
ing a probability distribution over features for each
word (see Table 1). A word’s meaning is repre-
sented by the concatenation of its textual and per-
ceptual vectors (see Figure 3). If a word has not
been normed, its perceptual vector will be all zeros.
Johns and Jones (2012) propose a two-step estima-
tion process for words without perceptual vectors.
Initially, a perceptual vector is constructed based on
the word’s weighted similarity to other words that
have non-zero perceptual vectors:
pin f =
N
?
i=1
ti ? sim(ti,p)? (6)
where p is the representation of a word with a tex-
tual vector but an empty perceptual vector, ts are
composite representations consisting of textual and
perceptual vectors, sim is a measure of distributional
similarity such as cosine, ? a weighting parameter,
and pin f the resulting inferred representation of the
word. The process is repeated a second time, so
as to incorporate the inferred perceptual vector in
the computation of the inferred vectors of all other
words. An example of this inference procedure is
illustrated in Figure 3.

2.3 Canonical Correlation Analysis
Our third model uses Canonical Correlation Analy-
sis (CCA, Hardoon et al. (2004)) to learn a joint se-
mantic representation from the textual and percep-
tual views. Given two random variables x and y
(or two sets of vectors), CCA can be seen as de-
termining two sets of basis vectors in such a way,
that the correlation between the projections of the
variables onto these bases is mutually maximized
(Borga, 2001). In effect, the representation-specific
details pertaining to the two views of the same phe-
nomenon are discarded and the underlying hidden
factors responsible for the correlation are revealed.
In our case the linguistic view is represented by a
term-document matrix, T ? RN×D, containing infor-
mation about the occurrence of each word in each
document. The perceptual view is captured by a
perceptual matrix, P ? [0,1]N×F , representing words
as a probability distribution over normed features.
CCA is concerned with describing linear dependen-
cies between two sets of variables of relatively low
dimensionality. Since the correlation between the
linguistic and perceptual views may exist in some
nonlinear relationship, we used a kernelized version
of CCA (Hardoon et al., 2004) which first projects
the data into a higher-dimensional feature space and
then performs CCA in this new feature space. The
two kernel matrices are KT = TT ? and KP = PP?.
After applying CCA we obtain two matrices pro-
jected onto L basis vectors, Ct ? RN×L, resulting
from the projection of the textual matrix T onto the
new basis and Cp ?RN×L, resulting from the projec-
tion of the corresponding perceptual feature matrix.
The meaning of a word can thus be represented by
its projected textual vector in CT , its projected per-
ceptual vector in CP or their concatenation. Figure 4
shows an example of the textual and perceptual vec-
tors for the word apple which were used as input for
CCA (first row) and their new representation after
the projection onto new basis vectors (second row).
The CCA model as sketched above will only ob-
tain full representations for words with perceptual
features available. One solution would be to apply
the method from Johns and Jones (2012) to infer the
perceptual vectors and then perform CCA on the in-
ferred vectors. Another approach which we assess
experimentally (see Section 4) is to create a percep-
tual vector for a word that has none from its k-most
(textually) similar neighbors, simply by taking the
average of their perceptual vectors. This inference
procedure can be applied to the original vectors or
the projected vectors in CT and CP, respectively,
once CCA has taken place.
2.4 Discussion
Johns and Jones (2012) primarily present a model of
perceptual inference, where textual data is used to
infer perceptual information for words not included
in feature norms. There is no means in this model to
obtain a joint representation resulting from the mu-
tual influence of the perceptual and textual views.
As shown in the example in Figure 3 the textual
vector on the left-hand side does not undergo any
transformation whatsoever. The generative model
put forward by Andrews et al. (2009) learns meaning
representations by simultaneously considering doc-
uments and features. Rather than simply adding per-
ceptual information to textual data it integrates both
modalities jointly in a single representation which
is desirable, at least from a cognitive perspective.
It is unlikely that we have separate representations
for different aspects of word meaning (Rogers et al.,
2004). Similarly to Johns and Jones (2012), An-
drews et al’s (2009) feature-topic model can also
infer perceptual representations for words that have
none. The inference is performed automatically in
an implicit manner during component induction.
In CCA, textual and perceptual data represent two
different views of the same objects and the model
operates on these views directly without combining
or manipulating any of them a priori. Instead, the
combination of the two modalities is realized via
1427
correlating the linear relationships between them. A
drawback of the model lies in the need of additional
methods for inferring perceptual representations for
words not available in feature norms.
3 Experimental Setup
Data All our experiments used a lemmatized ver-
sion of the British National Corpus (BNC) as a
source of textual information. The feature norms of
McRae et al. (2005) were used as a proxy for percep-
tual information. The BNC comprises 4,049 texts
totalling approximately 100 million words. McRae
et al.’s feature norms consist of 541 words and 2,526
features; 824 of these features occur with at least two
different words.
Evaluation Tasks Our evaluation experiments
compared the models discussed above on three
tasks. Two of them have been previously used
to evaluate semantic representation models, namely
word association and word similarity. In order
to simulate word association, we used the human
norms collected by (Nelson et al., 1998).1 These
were established by presenting a large number of
participants with a cue word (e.g., rice) and ask-
ing them to name an associate word in response
(e.g., Chinese, wedding, food, white). For each cue
word, the norms provide a set of associates and the
frequencies with which they were named. We can
thus compute the probability distribution over asso-
ciates for each cue. Analogously, we can estimate
the degree of similarity between a cue and its as-
sociates using our models (see the following sec-
tion for details on the similarity measures we em-
ployed). The norms contain 63,619 unique normed
cue-associate pairs in total. Of these, 25,968 pairs
were covered by all models and 520 appeared in
McRae et al.’s (2005) norms. Using correlation anal-
ysis, we examined the degree of linear relationship
between the human cue-associate probabilities and
the automatically derived similarity values.
Our word similarity experiments used the
WordSimilarity-353 test collection (Finkelstein et
al., 2002)2 which consists of relatedness judgments
1Available at http://www.usf.edu/Freeassociation.
2Available at http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/˜gabr/
resources/data/wordsim353/.
for word pairs. For each pair, a similarity judg-
ment (on a scale of 0 to 10) was elicited from 13 or
16 human subjects (e.g., tiger-cat are very similar,
whereas delay–racism are not). The average rating
for each pair represents an estimate of the perceived
similarity of the two words. The task varies slightly
from word association. Here, participants are asked
to rate perceived similarity rather than to generate
the first word that came to mind in response to a cue
word. The collection contains similarity ratings for
353 word pairs. Of these, 76 pairs appeared in our
corpus and 3 in McRae et al.’s (2005) norms. Again,
we evaluated how well model produced similarities
correlate with human ratings. Throughout this paper
we report correlation coefficients using Pearson’s r.
Our third task assessed the models’ ability to in-
fer perceptual vectors for words that have none. To
do this, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
McRae et al.’s (2005) norms. We treated the per-
ceptual vectors in each test fold as unseen, and used
the data in the corresponding training fold together
with the models presented in Section 2 to infer them.
Then, for each word, we examined how close the in-
ferred vector was to the actual one, via correlation
analysis.
Model Parameters The feature-topic model has a
few parameters that must be instantiated. These in-
clude, C, the number of predefined components and
the priors ?, ?, and ?. Following Andrews et al.
(2009), the components C were set to 350.3 A vague
inverse gamma prior was placed on ?, ?, and ?.4 To
measure word similarity within this model, we adopt
Griffiths et al.’s (2007) definition. The underlying
idea is that word association can be expressed as a
conditional distribution. If we have seen word w1,
then we can determine the probability that w2 will
be also generated by computing P(w2|w1). Assum-
ing that both w1 and w2 came from a single compo-
nent, P(w2|w1) can be estimated as:
P(w2|w1) =
C
?
c=1
P(w2|xc)P(xc|w1)
P(xc|w1) ? P(w1|xc)P(xc)
(7)
3As we explain in Section 4 the feature-topic model was
compared to a vanilla LDA model trained on the BNC only.
For that model, C was set to 250.
4That is P(•) = exp(? 1• )•
?2.
1428
where P(xc) is uniform, a single component xc is
sampled from the distribution P(xc|w1), and an over-
all estimate is obtained by averaging over all C com-
ponents.
Johns and Jones’ (2012) model uses binary tex-
tual vectors to represent word meaning. If the word
is present in a given document, that vector element
is coded as one; if it is absent, it is coded as zero.
We built a binary term-document matrix from the
BNC over 14,000 lemmas. The value of the similar-
ity weighting parameter ? was set to the same values
reported by Johns and Jones (?1=3 for Step 1 and
?2 = 13 for Step 2).
For the CCA model, we represented the textual
view with a term-document co-occurrence matrix.
Matrix cells were set to their tf-idf values.5 The tex-
tual and perceptual matrices were projected onto 410
vectors. As mentioned in Section 2.3, CCA does not
naturally lend itself to inferring perceptual vectors,
yet a perceptual vector for a word can be created
from its k-nearest neighbors. We inferred a percep-
tual vector by averaging over the perceptual vectors
of the word’s k most similar words; textual similarity
between two words was measured using the cosine
of the angle of the two vectors representing them.
To find the optimal value for k, we used one third of
Nelson’s (1998) cues as development set. The high-
est correlation was achieved with k = 2 when the
perceptual vectors were created prior to CCA and
k = 8 when they were inferred on the projected tex-
tual and perceptual matrices.
4 Results
Our experiments were designed to answer three
questions: (1) Does the integration of perceptual and
textual information yield a better fit with behavioral
data compared to a model that considers only one
data source? (2) What is the best way to integrate
the two modalities, e.g., via simple concatenation or
jointly? (3) How accurately can we approximate the
perceptual information when the latter is absent?
To answer the first question, we assessed the mod-
els’ performance when textual and perceptual infor-
mation are both available. The results in Table 2
are thus computed on the subset of Nelson’s (1998)

matrix consistently performed worse.

As can be seen, Andrews et al.’s (2009) feature-
topic model provides a better fit with the association
data when both modalities are taken into account
(+t+p). A vanilla LDA model constructed solely
on the BNC (+t?p) or McRae et al.’s (2005) fea-
ture norms (?t+p) yields substantially lower corre-
lations. We observe a similar pattern with Johns and
Jones’ (2012) global similarity model. Concatena-
tion of perceptual and textual vectors yields the best
fit with the norming data, relying on perceptual in-
formation alone (?t+p) comes close, whereas tex-
tual information on its own seems to have a weaker
effect (+t?p).6 The CCA model takes perceptual
and textual information as input in order to find a
projection onto basis vectors that are maximally cor-
related. Although by definition the CCA model must
operate on the two views, we can nevertheless iso-
late the contribution of each modality by considering
the vectors resulting from the projection of the tex-

tual matrix (+t?p), the perceptual matrix (?t+p) or
their concatenation (+t+p). We obtain best results
with the latter representation; again we observe that
the perceptual information is more dominant.
Overall we find that the feature-topic model and
CCA perform best. In fact the correlations achieved
by the two models do not differ significantly, us-
ing a t-test (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). The per-
formance of the global similarity model is signifi-
cantly worse than the feature-topic model and CCA
(p < 0.01). Recall that the feature-topic model
(+t+p) represents words as distributions over com-
ponents, whereas the global similarity model sim-
ply concatenates the textual and perceptual vectors.
The same input is also given to CCA which in turn
attempts to interpret the data by inferring common
relationships between the two views. In sum, we
can conclude that the higher correlation with human
judgments indicates that integrating textual and per-
ceptual modalities jointly is preferable to concatena-
tion.
However, note that all models in Table 2 fall
short of the human upper bound which we mea-
sured by calculating the reliability of Nelson et al.’s
(1998) norms. Reliability estimates the likelihood
of a similarly-composed group of participants pre-
sented with the same task under the same circum-
stances producing identical results. We split the col-
lected cue-associate pairs randomly into two halves
and computed the correlation between them; this
correlation was averaged across 200 random splits.
These correlations were adjusted by applying the
Spearman-Brown prediction formula (Voorspoels et
al., 2008).
The results in Table 2 are computed on a small
fraction of Nelson et al.’s (1998) norms. One might
even argue that the comparison is slightly unfair as
the global similarity model is more geared towards
inferring perceptual vectors rather than integrating
the two modalities in the best possible way. To gain
a better understanding of the models’ behavior and
to allow comparisons on a larger dataset and more
equal footing, we also report results on the entire
dataset (20,556 cue-associate pairs).7 This entails
that the models will infer perceptual vectors for the

words that are not attested in McRae et al.’s norms.
Recall from Section 2.3 that CCA does not have
a dedicated inference mechanism. We thus experi-
mented with three options (a) interfacing the infer-
ence method of Johns and Jones (2012) with CCA
(global similarity  CCA) (b) creating a percep-
tual vector from the words’ k-nearest neighbors be-
fore (k-NN  CCA) or (c) after CCA takes place
(CCA k-NN).
Our results are summarized in Table 3. The up-
per bound was estimated in the same fashion as for
the smaller dataset. Despite being statistically sig-
nificant (p < 0.01), the correlation coefficients are
lower. This is hardly surprising as perceptual infor-
mation is approximate and in several cases likely to
be wrong. Interestingly, we observe similar mod-
eling trends, irrespective of whether the models are
performing perceptual inference or not. The feature-
topic model achieves the best fit with the data, fol-
lowed by CCA. The inference method here does not
seem to have much of an impact: CCA  k-NN
does as well as global similarity  CCA. This is
perhaps expected as the inference procedure adopted
by Johns and Jones (2012) is a generalization of our
k-nearest neighbor approach. The global similarity
model performs worst; we conjecture that this is due
to the way semantic information is integrated rather
than the inference method itself. CCA works with
similar input, yet achieves better correlations with
the human data, due to its ability to represent the
commonalities shared by the two modalities. Taken
together the results in Tables 2 and 3 provide an an-
swer to our second question. Models that capture la-
tent information shared between the two modalities

create more accurate semantic representations com-
pared to simply treating the two as independent data
sources.
In order to isolate the influence of the inference
method from the resulting semantic representation
we evaluated the inferred perceptual vectors on their
own by computing their correlation with the original
feature distributions in McRae et al.’s (2005) norms.
The correlation coefficients are reported in Table 4
and were computed by averaging the coefficients ob-
tained for individual words. Here, the global simi-
larity model achieves the highest correlation, and for
a good reason. It is the only model with an empha-
sis on inference, the other two models do not have
such a dedicated mechanism. CCA has in fact none,
whereas in the feature-topic model the inference of
missing perceptual information is a by-product of
the generative process. The results in Table 4 indi-
cate that the perceptual vectors are not reconstructed
very accurately (the highest correlation coefficient
is .25) and that better inference mechanisms are re-
quired for perceptual information to have a positive
impact on semantic representation.
In Table 5 we examine the models’ performance
on semantic similarity rather than association using
the WordSimilarity-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al.,
2002). The models were evaluated on 76 word pairs
that appeared in the BNC. We inferred the percep-
tual vectors for 51 words. We computed the upper
bound using the reliability method described ear-
lier. Again, the joint models achieve better results
than the simple concatenation model. The feature-
topic and CCA models perform comparably, with
the global similarity model lagging substantially be-
hind. In sum, our results indicate that the issue
of how to best integrate the two modalities has a

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented a comparative study
of semantic representation models which compute
word meaning on the basis of linguistic and per-
ceptual information. The models differ in terms
of the mechanisms by which they integrate the two
modalities. In the feature-topic model (Andrews et
al., 2009), the textual and perceptual views are in-
tegrated via a set of latent components that are in-
ferred from the joint distribution of textual words
and perceptual features. The model based on Canon-
ical Correlation Analysis (Hardoon et al., 2004) in-
tegrates the two views by deriving a consensus rep-
resentation based on the correlation between the lin-
guistic and perceptual modalities. Johns and Jones’
(2012) similarity-based model simply concatentates
the two representations. In addition, it uses the lin-
guistic representations of words to infer perceptual
information when the latter is absent.
Experiments on word association and similarity
show that all models benefit from the integration of
perceptual data. We also find that joint models are
superior as they obtain a closer fit with human judg-
ments compared with an approach that simply con-
catenates the two views. We have also examined
how these models perform on the perceptual infer-
ence task which has implications for the wider appli-
cability of grounded semantic representation mod-
els. Johns and Jones’ (2012) inference mechanism
goes some way towards reconstructing the informa-
tion contained in the feature norms, however, further
1431
work is needed to achieve representations accurate
enough to be useful in semantic tasks.
In this paper we have used McRae et al.’s (2005)
norms without any extensive feature engineering
other than applying a frequency cut-off. In the fu-
ture we plan to experiment with feature selection
methods in an attempt to represent perceptual in-
formation more succinctly. For example, it may
be that different features are appropriate for differ-
ent word classes (e.g., color versus event denoting
nouns). Although feature norms are a useful first ap-
proximation of perceptual data, the effort involved in
eliciting them limits the scope of any computational
model based on normed data. A natural avenue for
future work would be to develop semantic represen-
tation models that exploit perceptual data that is both
naturally occurring and easily accessible (e.g., im-
ages, physical simulations).
