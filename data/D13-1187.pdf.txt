Abstract
Different demographics, e.g., gender or age,
can demonstrate substantial variation in their
language use, particularly in informal contexts
such as social media. In this paper we focus on
learning gender differences in the use of sub-
jective language in English, Spanish, and Rus-
sian Twitter data, and explore cross-cultural
differences in emoticon and hashtag use for
male and female users. We show that gen-
der differences in subjective language can ef-
fectively be used to improve sentiment anal-
ysis, and in particular, polarity classification
for Spanish and Russian. Our results show
statistically significant relative F-measure im-
provement over the gender-independent base-
line 1.5% and 1% for Russian, 2% and 0.5%
for Spanish, and 2.5% and 5% for English for
polarity and subjectivity classification.
1 Introduction
Sociolinguistics and dialectology have been study-
ing the relationships between language and speech at
the phonological, lexical and morphosyntactic lev-
els and social identity for decades (Picard, 1997;
Gefen and Ridings, 2005; Holmes and Meyerhoff,
2004; Macaulay, 2006; Tagliamonte, 2006). Re-
cent studies have focused on exploring demographic
language variations in personal email communica-
tion, blog posts, and public discussions (Boneva et
al., 2001; Mohammad and Yang, 2011; Eisenstein
et al., 2010; O’Connor et al., 2010; Bamman et al.,
2012). However, one area that remains largely unex-
plored is the effect of demographic language varia-
tion on subjective language use, and whether these
differences may be exploited for automatic senti-
ment analysis. With the growing commercial im-
portance of applications such as personalized rec-
ommender systems and targeted advertising (Fan
and Chang, 2009), detecting helpful product review
(Ott et al., 2011), tracking sentiment in real time
(Resnik, 2013), and large-scale, low-cost, passive
polling (O’Connor et al., 2010), we believe that sen-
timent analysis guided by user demographics is a
very important direction for research.
In this paper, we focus on gender demographics
and language in social media to investigate differ-
ences in the language used to express opinions in
Twitter for three languages: English, Spanish, and
Russian. We focus on Twitter data because of its vol-
ume, dynamic nature, and diverse population world-
wide.1 We find that some words are more or less
likely to be positive or negative in context depend-
ing on the the gender of the author. For example, the
word weakness is more likely to be used in a pos-
itive way by women (Chocolate is my weakness!)
but in a negative way by men (Clearly they know
our weakness. Argggg). The Russian word ???????
(achieve) is used in a positive way by male users and
in a negative way by female users.
Our goals of this work are to (1) explore the gen-
der bias in the use of subjective language in so-
cial media, and (2) incorporate this bias into models
to improve sentiment analysis for English, Spanish,
and Russian. Specifically, in this paper we:
• investigate multilingual lexical variations in the
use of subjective language, and cross-cultural

emoticon and hashtag usage on a large scale in
Twitter data;2
• show that gender bias in the use of subjec-
tive language can be used to improve sentiment
analysis for multiple languages in Twitter.
• demonstrate that simple, binary features repre-
senting author gender are insufficient; rather, it
is the combination of lexical features, together
with set-count features representing gender-
dependent sentiment terms that is needed for
statistically significant improvements.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
to show that incorporating gender leads to signifi-
cant improvements for sentiment analysis, particu-
larly subjectivity and polarity classification, for mul-
tiple languages in social media.
2 Related Work
Numerous studies since the early 1970’s have inves-
tigated gender-language differences in interaction,
theme, and grammar among other topics (Schiffman,
2002; Sunderland et al., 2002). More recent research
has studied gender differences in telephone speech
(Cieri et al., 2004; Godfrey et al., 1992) and emails
(Styler, 2011). Mohammad and Yang (2011) ana-
lyzed gender differences in the expression of senti-
ment in love letters, hate mail, and suicide notes, and
emotional word usage across genders in email.
There has also been a considerable amount of
work in subjectivity and sentiment analysis over
the past decade, including, more recently, in mi-
croblogs (Barbosa and Feng, 2010; Bermingham
and Smeaton, 2010; Pak and Paroubek, 2010; Bifet
and Frank, 2010; Davidov et al., 2010; Li et
al., 2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Jiang et al.,
2011; Agarwal et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011;
Calais Guerra et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2011; Chen
et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). In spite of the surge of
research in both sentiment and social media, only a
limited amount of work focusing on gender identi-
fication has looked at differences in subjective lan-
guage across genders within social media. Thel-
wall (2010) found that men and women use emoti-
cons to differing degrees on MySpace, e.g., female
2Gender-dependent and independent lexical resources of
subjective terms in Twitter for Russian, Spanish and English can

users express positive emoticons more than male
users. Other researchers included subjective patterns
as features for gender classification of Twitter users
(Rao et al., 2010). They found that the majority of
emotion-bearing features, e.g., emoticons, repeated
letters, exasperation, are used more by female than
male users, which is consistent with results reported
in other recent work (Garera and Yarowsky, 2009;
Burger et al., 2011; Goswami et al., 2009; Argamon
et al., 2007). Other related work is that of Otter-
bacher (2010), who studied stylistic differences be-
tween male and female reviewers writing product
reviews, and Mukherjee and Liu (2010), who ap-
plied positive, negative and emotional connotation
features for gender classification in microblogs.
Although previous work has investigated gen-
der differences in the use of subjective language,
and features of sentiment have been used in gender
identification, to the best of our knowledge no one
has yet investigated whether gender differences in
the use of subjective language can be exploited to
improve sentiment classification in English or any
other language. In this paper we seek to answer this
question for the domain of social media.
3 Data
For the experiments in this paper, we use three sets
of data for each language: a large pool of data (800K
tweets) labeled for gender but unlabeled for senti-
ment, plus 2K development data and 2K test data
labeled for both sentiment and gender. We use the
unlabeled data to bootstrap Twitter-specific lexicons
and investigate gender differences in the use of sub-
jective language. We use the development data for
parameter tuning while bootstrapping, and the test
data for sentiment classification.
For English, we download tweets from the corpus
created by Burger et al. (2011). This dataset con-
tains 2,958,103 tweets from 184K users, excluding
retweets. Retweets are omitted because our focus is
on the sentiment of the person tweeting; in retweets,
the words originate from a different user. All users
in this corpus have gender labels, which Burger et
al. automatically extracted from self-reported gen-
der on Facebook or MySpace profiles linked to by
the Twitter users. English tweets are identified using
a compression-based language identification (LID)
1816
tool (Bergsma et al., 2012). According to LID,
there are 1,881,620 (63.6%) English tweets from
which we select a random, gender-balanced sample
of 0.8M tweets. Burger’s corpus does not include
Russian and Spanish data on the same scale as En-
glish. Therefore, for Russian and Spanish we con-
struct a new Twitter corpus by downloading tweets
from followers of region-specific news and media
Twitter feeds. We use LID to identify Russian and
Spanish tweets, and remove retweets as before. In
this data, gender is labeled automatically based on
user first and last name morphology with a precision
above 0.98 for all languages.
Sentiment labels for tweets in the development
and test sets are obtained using Amazon Mechanical
Turk. For each tweet we collect annotations from
five workers and use majority vote to determine the
final label for the tweet. Snow et al. (2008) show
that for a similar task, labeling emotion and valence,
on average four non-expert labelers are needed to
achieve an expert level of annotation. Below are the
example Russian tweets labeled for sentiment:
• Pos: ??? ?? ??????? ?????? ???? ? ??-
????? ????? ???????? ???... (It is a great
pleasure to go to bed after a long day at work...)
• Neg: ????????? ???????? ???????? ??-
???? ??? ??????! (Dear Mr. Prokhorov just
buy the elections!)
• Both: ????????? ???? ?? ??????? ?????!
?? ???? ?????????? ????????? ??? ????
????? :) (It was crowded at the local market!
But I got presents for my family:-))
• Neutral: ???? ????? ?????? ????? (Kiev is
a very old city).
Table 1 gives the distribution of tweets over senti-
ment and gender labels for the development and test
sets for English (EDEV, ETEST), Spanish (SDEV,
STEST), and Russian (RDEV, RTEST).

4 Subjective Language and Gender
To study the intersection of subjective language and
gender in social media, ideally we would have a
large corpus labeled for both. Although our large
corpus is labeled for gender, it is not labeled for sen-
timent. Only the 4K tweets for each language that
compose the development and test sets are labeled
for both gender and sentiment. Obtaining sentiment
labels for all tweets would be both impractical and
expensive. Instead we use large multilingual senti-
ment lexicons developed specifically for Twitter as
described below. Using these lexicons we can begin
to explore the relationship between subjective lan-
guage and gender in the large pool of data labeled
for gender but unlabeled for sentiment. We also
look at the relationship between gender and the use
of different hashtags and emoticons. These can be
strong indicators of sentiment in social media, and in
fact are sometimes used to create noisy training data
for sentiment analysis in Twitter (Pak and Paroubek,
2010; Kouloumpis et al., 2011).
4.1 Bootstrapping Subjectivity Lexicons
Recent work by Banea et.al (2012) classifies meth-
ods for bootstrapping subjectivity lexicons into two
types: corpus-based and dictionary-based. Corpus-
based methods extract subjectivity lexicons from
unlabeled data using different similarity metrics
to measure the relatedness between words, e.g.,
Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). Corpus-based
methods have been used to bootstrap lexicons
for ENGLISH (Turney, 2002) and other languages,
including ROMANIAN (Banea et al., 2008) and
JAPANESE (Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2007).
Dictionary-based methods rely on relations be-
tween words in existing lexical resources. For exam-
ple, Rao and Ravichandran (2009) construct HINDI
and FRENCH sentiment lexicons using relations in
WordNet (Miller, 1995), Rosas et. al. (2012) boot-
strap a SPANISH lexicon using SentiWordNet (Bac-
cianella et al., 2010) and OpinionFinder,3 Clematide
and Klenner (2010), Chetviorkin et al. (2012) and
Abdul-Mageed et. al. (2011) automatically expand
and evaluate GERMAN, RUSSIAN and ARABIC sub-
jective lexicons.

1817
We use the corpus-based, language-independent
approach proposed by Volkova et al. (2013) to boot-
strap Twitter-specific subjectivity lexicons. To start,
the new lexicon is seeded with terms from the initial
lexicon LI . On each iteration, tweets in the unla-
beled data are labeled using the current lexicon. If a
tweet contains one or more terms from the lexicon it
is marked subjective, otherwise neutral. Tweet po-
larity is determined in a similar way, but takes into
account negation. For every term not in the lexi-
con with a frequency threshold, the probability of
that word appearing in a subjective sentence is cal-
culated. The top k terms with a subjective probabil-
ity are then added to the lexicon. Bootstrapping con-
tinues until there are no more new terms meeting the
criteria to add to the lexicon. The parameters are op-
timized using a grid search on the development data
using F-measure for subjectivity classification. In
Table 2 we report size and term polarity from the ini-
tial LI and the bootstrapped LB lexicons. Although
more sophisticated bootstrapping methods exist, this
approach has been shown to be effective for atomi-
cally learning subjectivity lexicons in multiple lan-
guages on a large scale without any external, rich,
lexical resources, e.g., WordNet, or advanced NLP
tools, e.g., syntactic parsers (Wiebe, 2000) or infor-
mation extraction tools (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).
For English, seed terms for bootstrapping are
the strongly subjective terms in the MPQA lexicon
(Wilson et al., 2005). For Spanish and Russian, the
seed terms are obtained by translating the English
seed terms using a bi-lingual dictionary, collecting
subjectivity judgments from MTurk on the transla-
tions, filtering out translations that are not strongly
subjective, and expanding the resulting word lists
with plurals and inflectional forms.
To verify that bootstrapping does provide a bet-
ter resource than existing dictionary-expanded lexi-
cons, we compare our Twitter-specific lexicons LB

isting state-of-the-art subjective lexicons including:
• 8K strongly subjective English terms from Sen-
tiWordNet ?E (Baccianella et al., 2010);
• 1.5K full strength terms from the Spanish sen-
timent lexicon ?S (Perez-Rosas et al., 2012);
• 5K terms from the Russian sentiment lexicon
?R (Chetviorkin and Loukachevitch, 2012).
For that we apply rule-based subjectivity classi-
fication on the test data.4 This subjectivity classi-
fier predicts that a tweet is subjective if it contains
at least one, or at least two subjective terms from
the lexicon. To make a fair comparison, we auto-
matically expand ?E with plurals and inflectional
forms, ?S with the inflectional forms for verbs, and
?R with the inflectional forms for adverbs, adjec-
tives and verbs. We report precision, recall and F-
measure results in Table 3 and show that our boot-
strapped lexicons outperform the corresponding ini-
tial lexicons and the external resources.

4.2 Lexical Evaluation
With our Twitter-specific sentiment lexicons, we
can now investigate how the subjective use of these
terms differs depending on gender for our three lan-
guages. Figure 1 illustrates what we expect to find.
{F} and {M} are the sets of subjective terms used
by females and males, respectively. We expect that
some terms will be used by males, but never by fe-
males, and vice-versa. The vast majority, however,
will be used by both genders. Within this set of
shared terms, many words will show little difference
4A similar rule-based approach using terms from the
MPQA lexicon is suggested by (Riloff and Wiebe, 2003).

and gender-independent GInd sentiment terms.
in their subjective use when considering gender, but
there will be some words for which gender will have
an influence. Of particular interest for our work are
words in which the polarity of a term as it is used in
context is gender-influenced, the extreme case being
terms that flip their polarity depending on the gender
of the user. Polarity may be different because the
concept represented by the term tends to be viewed
in a different light depending on gender. There are
also words like weakness in which a more positive or
more negative word sense tends to be used by men
or women. In Figure 2 we show the distribution of
gender-specific and gender-independent terms from
the LB lexicons for all languages.
To identify gender-influenced terms in our lexi-
cons, we start by randomly sampling 400K male and
400K female tweets for each language from the data.
Next, for both genders we calculate the probability
of term ti appearing in a tweet with another subjec-
tive term (Eq.1), and the probability of it appearing
with a positive or negative term (Eq.2-3) from LB .
pti(subj?g) =
c(ti, P, g) + c(ti,N, g)
c(ti, g)
, (1)
where g ? F,M and P and N are positive and nega-
tive sets of terms from the initial lexicon LI .
pti(+?g) =
c(ti, P, g)
c(ti, P, g) + c(ti,N, g)
(2)
pti(??g) =
c(ti,N, g)
c(ti, P, g) + c(ti,N, g)
(3)
We introduce a novel metric ?p+ti to measure po-
larity change across genders. For every subjective
term ti we want to maximize the difference5:
?p+ti = ?pti(+?F ) ? pti(+?M)?
s.t.
RRRRRRRRRRRR
1 ?
tfsubjti (F )
tfsubjti (M)
RRRRRRRRRRRR
? ?, tfsubjti (M) ? 0, (4)
where p(+?F ) and p(+?M) are probabilities that
term ti is positive for females and males respec-
tively; tfsubjti (F ) and tf
subj
ti (M) are correspond-
ing term frequencies (if tfsubjti (F ) > tf
subj
ti (M) the
fraction is flipped); ? is a threshold that controls
the level of term frequency similarity6. The terms
in which polarity is most strongly gender-influenced
are those with ?? 0 and ?p+ti ? 1.
Table 4 shows a sample of the most strongly
gender-influenced terms from the initial LI and the
bootstrapped LB lexicons for all languages. A plus
(+) means that the term tends to be used positively
by women and minus (?) means that the term tends
to be used positively by men. For instance, in En-
glish we found that perfecting is used with negative
polarity by male users but with positive polarity by
female users; the term dogfighting has negative po-
larity for women but positive polarity for men.
4.3 Hashtags
People may also express positive or negative senti-
ment in their tweets using hashtags. From our bal-
anced samples of 800K tweets for each language,
we extracted 611, 879, and 71 unique hashtags for
English, Spanish, and Russian, respectively. As we
did for terms in the previous section, we evaluated
the subjective use of the hashtags. Some of these are
clearly expressing sentiment (#horror), while others
seem to be topics that people are frequently opinion-
ated about (#baseball, #latingrammy, #spartak).
5One can also maximize ?p?ti = ?pti(??F ) ? pti(??M)?.
6? = 0 means term frequencies are identical for both gen-
ders; ?? 1 indicates increasing gender divergence.

Table 5: Hashtag examples with opposite polarity across genders for English, Spanish, and Russian.
Table 5 gives the hashtags, correlated with sub-
jective language, that are most strongly gender-
influenced. Analogously to ?p+ values in Table 4, a
plus (+) means the hashtag is more likely to be used
positively by women, and a minus (?) means the
hashtag is more likely to be used positively by men.
For example, in English we found that male users
tend to express positive sentiment in tweets men-
tioning #baseball, while women tend to be nega-
tive about this hashtag. The opposite is true for the
hashtag #parenting.
4.4 Emoticons
We investigate how emoticons are used differently
by men and women in social media following the
work by (Bamman et al., 2012). For that we rely on
the lists of emoticons from Wikipedia7 and present
the cross-cultural and gender emoticon differences
in Figure 3. The frequency of each emoticon is given
7List of emoticons from Wikipedia http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons
on the right of each language chart, with probability
of use by a male user in that language given on the
x-axis. The top 8 emoticons are the same across lan-
guages and sorted by English frequency.
We found that emoticons in English data are used
more overall by female users, which is consistent
with previous findings in Schnoebelen’s work.8 In
addition, we found that some emoticons like :-)
(smile face) and :-o (surprised) are used equally by
both genders, at least in Twitter. When comparing
English emoticon usage to other languages, there are
some similarities, but also some clear differences. In
Spanish data, several emoticons are more likely to be
used by male than by female users, e.g., :-o (sur-
prised) and :-& (tongue-tied), and the difference in
probability of use by males and females is greater
for the emoticons, as compared to the same emoti-
cons for English. Interestingly, in Russian Twitter

data emoticons tend to be used more or equally by
male users rather than female users.
5 Experiments
The previous section showed that there are gender
differences in the use of subjective language, hash-
tags, and emoticons in Twitter. We aim leverage
these differences to improve subjectivity and po-
larity classification for the informal, creative and
dynamically changing multilingual Twitter data.9
For that we conduct experiments using gender-
independent GInd and gender-dependent GDep
features and compare the results to evaluate the in-
fluence of gender on sentiment classification.
We experiment with two classification ap-
proaches: (I) rule-based classifier which uses only
subjective terms from the lexicons designed to verify
if the gender differences in subjective language cre-
ate enough of a signal to influence sentiment classifi-
cation; (II) state-of-the-art supervised models which
rely on lexical features as well as lexicon set-count
features.10,11 Moreover, to show that the gender-
9For polarity classification we distinguish between positive
and negative instances, which is the approach typically reported
in the literature for recognizing polarity (Velikovich et al., 2010;
Yessenalina and Cardie, 2011; Taboada et al., 2011)
10A set-count feature is a count of the number of instances
from a set of terms that appears in a tweet.
11We also experimented with repeated punctuation (!!, ??)
and letters (nooo, reealy), which are often used in sentiment
classification in social media. However, we found these features
sentiment signal can be learned by more than one
classifier we apply a variety of classifiers imple-
mented in Weka (Hall et al., 2009). For that we do
10-fold cross validation over English, Spanish, and
Russian test data (ETEST, STEST and RTEST) la-
beled with subjectivity (pos, neg, both vs. neut) and
polarity (pos vs. neg) as described in Section 3.
5.1 Models
For the rule-basedGIndRBsubj classifier, tweets are la-
beled as subjective or neutral as follows:
GIndRBsubj = {
1 if w? ? f? ? 0.5,
0 otherwise
(5)
where w? ? f? stands for weighted set features, e.g.,
terms from LI only, emoticons E, or different part-
of-speech tags (POS) from LB weighted using w =
p(subj) = p(subj?M) + p(subj?F ) subjectivity
score as shown in Eq.1. We experiment with the
POS tags to show the contribution of each POS to
sentiment classification.
Similarly, for the rule-based GIndRBpol classifier,
tweets are labeled as positive or negative:
GIndRBpol = {
1 if w?+ ? f?+ ? w?? ? f??,
0 otherwise
(6)
where f?+, f?? are feature sets that include only posi-
tive and negative features fromLI orLB;w+ andw?
to be noisy and adding them decreased performance.

are positive and negative polarity scores estimated
using Eq.2 - 3 such as: w+ = p(+?M) + p(+?F ) and
w? = p(??M) + p(??F ).
The gender-dependent rule-based classifiers are
defined in a similar way. Specifically, f? is replaced
by f?M and f?F in Eq.5 and f??, f?+ are replaced
by f?M?, f?F? and f?M+, f?F+ respectively in Eq.6.
We learn subjectivity s? and polarity p? score vectors
using Eq.1-3. The difference between GInd and
GDep models is that GInd scores w?, w?+ and w??
are not conditioned on gender.
For gender-independent classification using su-
pervised models, we build feature vectors using lex-
ical features V represented as term frequencies, to-
gether with set-count features from the lexicons:
f?GIndsubj = [LI , LB,E, V ];
f?GIndpol = [L
+
I , L
+
B,E
+, L?I , L
?
B,E
?, V ].
Finally, for gender-dependent supervised models,
we try different feature combinations. (A) We ex-
tract set-count features for gender-dependent subjec-
tive terms from LI , LB, and E jointly:
f?GDep?Jsubj = [L
M

(B) We extract disjoint (prefixed) gender-specific
features (in addition to lexical features V ) by rely-
ing only on female set-count features when classify-
ing female tweets; and only male set-count features
for male tweets. We refer to the joint features as
GInd?J andGDep?J , and to the disjoint features
GInd ?D and GDep ?D.
5.2 Results
Figures 4a and 4b show performance improvements
for subjectivity and polarity classification under the
rule-based approach when taking into account gen-
der. The left figure shows precision-recall curves
for subjective vs. neutral classification, and the mid-
dle figure shows precision-recall curves for positive
vs. negative classification. We measure performance
starting with features from LI , and then incremen-
tally add emoticon features E and features from LB
one part of speech at a time to show the contribution
of each part of speech for sentiment classification.12
This experiment shows that there is a clear improve-
ment for the models parameterized with gender, at
least for the simple, rule-based model.
For the supervised models we experiment with
a variety of learners for English to show that gen-
der differences in subjective language improve sen-
timent classification for many learning algorithms.
We present the results in Figure 4c. For subjectiv-
ity classification, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Naive Bayes (NB) and Bayesian Logistic Regres-
sion (BLR) achieve the best results, with improve-
ments in F-measure ranging from 0.5 - 5%. The po-
larity classifiers overall achieve much higher scores,
with improvements for GDep features ranging from
1-2%. BLR with Gaussian prior is the top scorer
12POS from the Twitter POSTagger (Gimpel et al., 2011).

features for Logistic Regression (LR) and SVM models.
for polarity classification with an F-measure of 82%.
We test our results for statistical significance us-
ing McNemar’s Chi-squared test (p-value < 0.01) as
suggested by Dietterich (1998). Only three classi-
fiers, J48, AdaBoostM1 (AB) and Random Forest
(RF) do not always show significant improvements
for GDep features over GInd features. However,
for the majority of classifiers, GDep models outper-
formGIndmodels for both tasks, demonstrating the
robustness of GDep features for sentiment analysis.
In Table 6 we report results for subjectivity and
polarity classification using the best performing
classifiers (as shown in Figure 4c) :
- Logistic Regression (LR) (Genkin et al., 2007)
for GInd ? J and GDep ? J models.
- SVM model with radial-based kernel for
GInd ? D and GDep ? D models. We use
LibSVM implementation (EL-Manzalawy and
Honavar, 2005).
Each ?R(%) row shows the relative percent im-
provements in terms of precision P , recall R, F-
measure F and accuracy A for GDep compared to
GInd models. Our results show that differences in
subjective language across genders can be exploited
to improve sentiment analysis, not only for English
but for multiple languages. For Spanish and Russian
results are lower for subjectivity classification, we
suspect, because lexical features V are already in-
flected for gender and set-count features are down-
weighted by the classifier. For polarity classifica-
tion, on the other hand, gender-dependent features
provide consistent, significant improvements (1.5-
2.5%) across all languages.
As a reality check, Table 6 also reports accuracies
(in Arand columns) for experiments that use random
permutations of male and female subjective terms,
which are then encoded as gender-dependent set-
count features as before. We found that all gender-
dependent models, GDep ? J and GDep ?D, out-
performed their random equivalents for both subjec-
tivity and polarity classification (as reflected by rel-
ative accuracy decrease ? forArand compared toA).
These results further confirm the existence of gen-
der bias in subjective language for any of our three
languages and its importance for sentiment analysis.
Finally, we check whether encoding gender as
a binary feature would be sufficient to improve
sentiment classification. For that we encode fea-

6 Conclusions
We presented a qualitative and empirical study that
analyses substantial and interesting differences in
subjective language between male and female users
in Twitter, including hashtag and emoticon usage
across cultures. We showed that incorporating au-
thor gender as a model component can significantly
improve subjectivity and polarity classification for
English (2.5% and 5%), Spanish (1.5% and 1%) and
Russian (1.5% and 1%). In future work we plan to
develop new models for joint modeling of personal-
ized sentiment, user demographics e.g., age and user
preferences e.g., political favorites in social media.
