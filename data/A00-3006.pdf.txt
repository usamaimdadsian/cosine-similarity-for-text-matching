Many corpora which are prime candidates 
for automatic error correction, such as the 
output of OCR software, and electronic texts 
incorporating markup tags, include informa- 
tion on which portions of the text are most 
likely to contain errors. 
This paper describes how the error 
markup tag <?> is being incorporated in 
the spell-checking of an electronic version 
of Diderot's Encyclopddie, and evaluates 
whether the presence of this tag has signif- 
icantly aided in correcting the errors which 
it marks. Although the usefulness of error 
tagging may vary from project to project, 
even as the precise way in which the tagging 
is done varies, error tagging does not nec- 
essarily confer any benefit in attempting to 
correct a given word. It may, of course, nev- 
ertheless be useful in marking errors to be 
fixed manually at a later stage of processing 
the text. 
1 The Encyclopddie 
1.1 P ro jec t  Overv iew 
The goal of this project is ultimately to 
detect and correct all errors in the elec- 
tronic version of the 18th century French 
encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, a
corpus of ca. 18 million words. This text is 
currently under development by the Project 
for American and French Research on the 
Treasury of the French Language (ARTFL); 
a project overview and limited sample of 
searchable text from the Encyclopddie are 
available at: 
http ://humanities. uchicago, edu/ARTFL/pro j ect s/encyc/. 
Andreev et al. (1999) also provides a 
thorough summary of the goals and status 
of the project. 
The electronic text was largely transcribed 
from the original, although parts of it were 
produced by optical character recognition on 
scanned images. Unfortunately, whether a 
section of text was transcribed or produced 
by OCR was not recorded at the time of data 
capture, so that the error correction strategy 
cannot be made sensitive to this parameter. 
Judging from a small hand-checked section 
of the text, the error rate is fairly low; about 
one word in 40 contains an error. It should 
also be added that the version of the text 
with which I am working has already been 
subjected to some corrective measures after 
the initial data capture stage. For exam- 
ple, common and easily identifiable mistakes 
such as the word enfant showing up as en- 
sant were simply globally repaired through- 
out the text. (The original edition of the En- 
cyclop~die made use of the sharp 's', which 
was often confused with an 'f' during data 
entry--cf. Figure 1.) 
At present, my focus is on non-word er- 
ror detection and correction, although use of 
word n-grams eems to be a fairly straight- 
forward extension to allow for the kind of 
context-sensitivity in error correction which 
has been the focus of much recent work 
(cf. Golding and Roth (1999), Mays et al. 
(1991), Yarowsky (1995)). 
The approach I am pursuing is an appli- 
cation of Bayesian statistics. We treat the 
process by which the electronic text was pro- 
duced as a noisy channel, and take as our 
goal the maximization of the probability of 
each input word, given a string which is the

output of the noisy channel. If we repre- 
sent the correct form by we, and the ob- 
served form by wo, our goal can be described 
as finding the wc which maximizes p(wclwo), 
the probability that wc is the intended form, 
given that wo is the observed form. 
By Bayes' rule, this can be reduced to 
the problem of maximizing p(wolwc)p(wc) Of pCwo) 
course, the probability of the observed string 
will be constant across all candidate correc- 
tions, so the same w~ will also maximize 
p(wolwc)p(w~). 
The term p(w~) (the prior probability) can 
be estimated by doing frequency counts on a 
corpus. In this case, I am using an interpo- 
lated model of Good-Turing smoothed word 
and letter probabilities as the prior. 
The term p(WolW~) is called the error 
model. Intuitively, it quantifies the prob- 
ability of certain kinds of errors resulting 
from the noisy channel. It is implemented 
as a confusion matrix, which associates a
probability with each input/output charac- 
ter pair, representing the probability of the 
input character being replaced by the out- 
put character. These probabilities can be 
estimated from a large corpus tagged for er- 
rors, but since I do not have access to such 
a source for this project, I needed to train 
the matrix as described in Kernighan et al. 
(1990). 
Cf. Jurafsky and Martin (1999) for an in- 
troduction to spelling correction using con- 
fusion matrices, and Kukich (1992) for a sur- 
vey of different strategies in spelling correc- 
tion. 
1.2 T reatment  of <?> 
A number of different SGML-style tags are 
currently used in the encoding of the En- 
cyclopddie, ranging from form-related tags 
such as <i> (for italic text), to semantic 
markup tags such as <art ic le>,  to the error 
tag <?>, the treatment of which is the focus 
of this article. The data entry specification 
for the project prescribes the use of <?> in 
all cases in which the keyboard operator has 
any doubt as to the identity of a printed 
character, and also when symbols appear 
in the text which cannot be represented in 
the Latin-1 codepage (except for Greek text, 
which is handled by other means). Other 
instances of the <?> tag were produced as 
indications of mistakes in OCR output. 
Some examples of the use of the error tag 
from the actual corpus include the following: 
<?> 
<?>darts 
J '<?>i  
ab<?>ci<?><?>es 
d 'aut re<?>alad ies  
for a Hebrew R 
for dans 
for J'ai 
for abscisses 
for d'autres maladies 
The first is a case where <?> was used to 
mark an untypeable character. In the sec- 
31 
ond case, it was somehow inserted superflu- 
ously (most likely by OCR). In the third row, 
<?> stands in for a single missing character, 
and in the fourth it does the same, but three 
times in a single word. Finally, in the last 
row the error tag indicates the omission of 
multiple characters, and even a word bound- 
ary. 
In fact, as Table 1 shows, words which in- 
clude the error tag generally have error types 
which are more difficult to correct than av- 
erage. Our confusion matrix-based approach 
is best at handling substitutions (e.g., onfin 
enfin), deletions (apeUent --~ appellent), 
and insertions (asselain ~ asselin), and can- 
not correct words with multiple errors at all. 1 
"Unrecoverable" rrors are those in which no 
"correction" is possible, for example, when 
non-ASCII symbols occur in the original. 
The fact that the error tag is used to code 
such a wide variety of irregularities in the 
corpus makes it difficult to incorporate into 
our general error correction strategy. Since 
<?> so often occurred as a replacement for a 
single, missing character, however, I treated 
it as a character in the language model, but 
one with an extremely low probability, so 
that any suggested correction would have to 
get rid of it in order to appreciably increase 
the probability of the word. 
In short, <?> is included in the confusion 
matrix as a character which may occur as the 
result of interference from the noisy chan- 
nel, but is highly unlikely to appear inde- 
pendently in the language. This approach 
ignores the many cases of multiple errors in- 
dicated by the error tag, but these probably 
pose too difficult a problem for this stage of 
the project anyhow. The funding available 
for the project does not currently allow us to 
pursue the possibility of computer-aided er- 
ror correction; rather, the program must cor- 
rect as many errors as it can without human 
intervention. Toward this end, we are will- 
ing to sacrifice the ability to cope with more

with cases such as ab<?>ci<?><?>es, in which the 
error tag occurs multiple times, but stands for a sin- 
gle letter in each case. 
esoteric error types in order to improve the 
reliability of the system on other error types. 
The actual performance of the spelling 
correction algorithm on words which include 
the error tag, while comparable to the per- 
formance on other words, is perhaps not as 
high as we might initially have hoped, given 
that they were already tagged as errors. Of 
the corrections uggested for words without 
<?>, 47% were accurate, while of the cor- 
rections suggested for words with <?>, 29% 
were accurate. 2 Actually, if we include cases 
in which the program correctly identified an 
error as "unrecoverable", and opted to make 
no change, the percentage for <?> sugges- 
tions rises to 71%. 
It may seem that these numbers in fact 
undermine the thesis that  the error tagging 
in the Encyclopddie was not useful in error 
correction. I.e., if the correction algorithm 
exhibits the correct behavior on 47% of un- 
tagged errors, and on 71% of tagged errors, 
it seems that  the tags are helping out some- 
what. Actually, this is not the case. First, 
we should not give the same weight to cor- 
rect behavior on unrecoverable errors (which 
means giving up on correction) and correct 
behavior on other errors (which means actu- 
ally finding the correct form). Second, the 
tagged errors are often simply 'worse' than 
untagged errors, so that  even if the OCR or 
keyboard operator had made a guess at the 
correct form, they would have easily been 
identifiable as errors, and even errors of a 
certain type. For example, I maintain that 
the form ab<?>ci<?><?>es would have been 
no more difficult to correct had it occurred 
i ns tead  as ab fc i f fes .  
2 Conc lus ion  
In sum, the errors which are marked with 
the <?> tag in the electronic version of the 
2I admit that these numbers may seem low, but 
bear in mind that the percentage r flects the accu- 
racy of the first guess made by the system, since its 
operation is required to be entirely automatic. Fur- 
thermore, the correction task is made more difficult 
by the fact that the corpus is an encyclopedia, which 
contains more infrequent words and proper names 
than most corpora.

Encyclopddie ncompass so many distinct er- 
ror types, and errors of such difficulty, that 
it is hard to come up with corrections for 
many of them without human intervention. 
For this reason, experience with the Ency- 
clopddie project suggests that error tagging 
is not necessarily a great aid in performing 
automatic error correction. 
There is certainly a great deal of room for 
further investigation into the use of meta- 
data in spelling correction in general, how- 
ever. While the error tag is a somewhat 
unique member of the tagset, in that it typ- 
ically flags a subpart of a word, rather than 
a string of words, this should not be taken 
to mean that it is the only tag which could 
be employed in spelling correction. If noth- 
ing else, "wider-scope" markup tags can be 
helpful in determining when certain parts of 
the corpus should not be seen as represen- 
tative of the language model, or should be 
seen as representative of a distinct language 
model. (For example, the italic tag <±>. of- 
ten marks Latin text in the Encyclopddie.) 
Ultimately, I believe that what is needed 
in order for text tagging to be useful in er- 
ror correction is a recognition that the tagset 
will influence the correction process. Tags 
which are applied in such a way as to de- 
limit sections of text which are relevant o 
correction (such as names, equations, and 
foreign language text), will be of greater use 
than tags which represent a mixture of such 
classes. Error tagging in particular should 
be most useful if it does not conflate quite 
distinct things that may be "wrong" with 
a text, such as illegibility of the original, 
unrenderable symbols, and OCR inaccura- 
cies. Such considerations are certainly rele- 
vant in the evaluation of emerging text en- 
coding standards, such as the specification 
of the Text Encoding Initiative.
