Abstract 
When implementing computational lexicons it is 
important o keep in mind the texts that a NLP 
system must deal with. Words relate to each 
other in many different, often queer, ways: this 
information is rarely found in dictionaries, and it 
is quite hard to be invented a priori, despite the 
imagination that linguists exhibit at inventing 
esoteric examples. 
In this paper we present the results of an 
experiment in learning from corpora the frequent 
selectional restrictions holding between content 
words. The method is based on the analysis of 
word associations augmented with syntactic 
markers and semantic tags. Word pairs are 
extracted by a morphosyntactic analyzer and 
clustered according to their semantic tags. A 
statistical measure is applied to the data to 
evaluate the significance of a detected relation. 
Clustered association data render the study of 
word associations more interesting with several 
respects: data are more reliable even for smaller 
corpora, more easy to interpret, and have many 
practical applications in NLP. 
1. Introduction 
One of the fundamental property of computational 
lexicons is an account of the relations between verbs 
and its arguments. Arguments are identified by their 
position in a predicate-argument structure, or by 
conceptual relations names (e.g. agent, purpose, 
location, etc). Arguments are annotated with 
selectional restrictions, that impose type constraints 
on the set of content words that may fill a relation. 
Selectional restrictions often do not provide all the 
semantic information that is necessary in NLP 
systems, however they are at the basis of the 
majority of computational pproaches to syntactic 
and semantic disambiguation. 
It has been noticed that representing only the 
semantics of verbs may be inadequate (Velardi et al. 
1988; Boguraev 1991; Macpherson 1991). The notion of 
spreading the semantic load supports the idea that 
every content word should be represented in the 
lexicon as the union of all the situations in which it 
could potentially participate. Unfortunately, hand 
writing selectional restrictions i  not an easy matter, 
because it is time consuming and it is hard to keep 
consistency among the data when the lexicon has 
several hundred or thousand words. However the 
major difficulty is that words relate to each other in 
many different, often domain dependent ways. The 
nowadays vast literature on computational lexicons 
is f i l led with neat  examples  of the 
eat(animate,food) flavour, but in practice in many 
language domains selectional constraints between 
words are quite odd. It is not just a matter of violating 
the semantic expectations, such as in "kill the 
process" or "my car drinks gasoline", neither it is 
that kind of fancifulness that linguists exhibit at 
f inding queer sentences. Rather, there exist 
statistically relevant linguistic relations that are 
hard to imagine a-priori, almost never found in 
dictionaries, and even harder to assign to the 
appropriate slot in the whatever conceptual structure 
adopted for lexical representation. Several examples 
of such relations are shown throughout this paper. 
Ideally, knowledge on word relations should be 
acquired directly from massive amounts of texts~ 
rather than from hand-crafted rules. This idea is a! 
the basis of many recent studies on word associations. 
The results of these studies have important 
applications in lexicography, to detect lexico- 
syntactic regularities (Church and Hanks, 19901 
(Calzolari and Bindi,1990), such as, for example~ 
support verbs (e.g. "make-decision") prepositional 
verbs (e.g. "rely-upon") idioms, semantic relations 
(e.g. "part_of") and fixed expressions (e.g. "kick the 
bucket"). In (Hindle,1990; Zernik, 1989; Webster el 
Marcus, 1989) cooccurrence analyses augmented with 
syntactic parsing is used for the purpose of word 
classification. All these studies are based on th~ 
(strong) assumption that syntactic similarity in wor(~ 
patterns implies semantic similarity. In (Guthrie el 
al., 1991), sets of consistently contiguous word~, 
("neighbourhood") are extracted from machine- 
readable  d ic t ionar ies ,  to help semantic 
disambiguation i information retrieval. In (Smadj~ 
and McKeown, 1990) statist ical ly collectec 
associations provide pragmatic ues for lexical choic( 
in sentence generation. For example, we can learr 
that "make decision" is a better choice than, say 
96
"have decision" or "take decision". (Hindle and 
Rooths,  1991) proposes  that a syntact ic 
disambiguation criterion can be gathered by 
comparing the probability of occurrence of noun- 
preposition and verb-preposition pairs in V NP PP 
structures. 
In general word associations are collected by 
extracting word pairs in a +-5 window. In (Calzolari 
and Bindi, 1990), (Church and Hanks, 1990) the 
significance of an association (x,y) is measured by the 
mutual information I(x,y), i.e. the probability of 
observing x and y together, compared with the 
probability of observing x and y independently. In
(Smadja, 1989), (Zernik and Jacobs, 1990), the 
associations are filtered by selecting the word pairs 
(x,y) whose frequency of occurrence is above f+ks, 
where f is the average appearance, s is the standard 
deviation, and k is an empirically determined factor. 
(Hindle, 1990; Hindle and Rooths,1991) and (Smadja, 
1991) use syntactic markers to increase the 
significance of the data. (Guthrie et al., 1991\] uses 
the subject classification given in machine-readable 
dictionaries (e.g. economics, engineering, etc.) to 
reinforce cooccurence links. 
Despite the use of these methods to add evidence to 
the data, the major problem with word-pairs 
collections is that reliable results are obtained only 
for a small subset of high-frequency words on very 
large corpora, otherwise the association ratio 
becomes unstable. For example, Church run his 
experiment on a corpus with over 20-30 millions 
words, and Hindle reports 6 millions words as not 
being an adequate corpus. In many practical NLP/IR 
applications corpora are not so large, and typically 
span from 500,000 to a few million words. The 
analysis of associations could be done on wider 
domains, but a part for very general words, it is much 
more desirable to collect data from the application 
corpus. Information collected from other sources could 
add noise rather than strengthening the data, 
because in most applications jargon, technical words, 
and domain-dependent associations are the norm. In 
(Smadja, 1989b) it is shown a table of operational 
pairs like adjective-noun and verb-object, from which 
clearly emerges the very different nature of the two 
source domains (Unix Usenet and Jerusalem Post). For 
example, the noun-noun pairs with "tree" include 
associations such as "parse, grammar, decision" and 
"olive, Christmas". If the NLP/ IR application is 
about the computer world, associations such as "olive 
tree" or "Christmas tree" are (at best) useless. 
A second problem with statistically collected word 
pairs is that an analysis based simply on surface 
distribution may produce data at a level of 
granular i ty too fine. For example, a purely 
distributional analysis for word classification, such 
as those cited above, might place two verbs into 
distinct classes because one is used primarily with an 
object olive and the other with the object grape. This 
may not be appropriate given the application. 
Abstraction via semantic lasses (e.g. VEGETABLE), 
would ensure that the ontology found is appropriate 
for the domain. The model of preposit ional 
attachment preference proposed by Hindle is also too 
weak if applied only to verb-preposition and noun- 
preposition pairs. A preposition may or may not be 
related to a verb, even if it frequently cooccurs with 
it, depending upon the underlying semantic relation. 
It is the semantic ategory of the noun following a 
preposition that determines the nature of the 
semantic link (e.g. for+ HUMAN ENTITY = 
beneficiary, for+ACTION = purpose), and ultimately 
influences the choice of  the proper attachment. 
Semantic abstraction also renders the data more 
readable. Millions of simple word cooccurrences let 
the experimenter sink in an ocean of data, without 
providing much insight of the conceptual nature of 
the detected associations. 
In this paper, we present a study on word associations 
augmented with syntactic markers and semantic 
tagging. We call these data clustered associations. 
Clustered association data are syntactic pairs or 
triples (e.g. N_V(\]ohn,go) V prep_N(go, to,Boston), 
N_prepN(Boston,by,bus) 1) in which one or both 
content words are replaced by their semantic tag 
(e .g .  V_prep_N(PHYS ICAL  ACT- to -  
PLACE),N_prep_N(PLACE-by-MACHINE) etc.). 
Semantic tags are very high-level in order to reduce 
the cost of hand-tagging. 
Clustered association data have several advantages: 
- First, statistically meaningful data can be 
gathered from (relatively) small corpora; 
- Second, data are presented in a compact form and 
are much more readable; 
- Third, clustered association data are useful for 
many interesting NLP applications, such as 
conceptual clustering, syntactic and semantic 
disambiguation, and semi-automatic learning of 
the relevant selectional restrictions in a given 
language domain. 
In this paper we discuss the results of an experiment 
in learning selectional restrictions, to provide support 
for the design of computational lexicons. Other 
results are presented in (Basili et al., 1991; Fabrizi et 
al., forthcomingl.

queer examples ince the introduction.

The method is applied to a corpus of economic 
enterprise descriptions, registered at the Chambers 
of Commerce in Italy. The database of these 
descriptions (in total over 1,000,000 descriptions, 
each spanning from 1 to 100-200 words) is managed in
Italy by the Company CERVED. Sentences describe 
one or several commercial enterprises carried out by a 
given Company. Examples of these descriptions are 
provided throughout the text. In our experiment, we 
used only 25,000 descriptions, including about 500,000 
words. A second experiment on a legal corpus is under 
preparation and will be ready shortly. 
2 Acqu i r ing  syntact i c  assoc ia t ions  
Clustered association data are collected by first 
extracting from the corpus all the syntactically 
related word pairs. 
Combining statistical and parsing methods has been 
done by (Hindle, 1990; Hindle and Rooths,1991) and 
(Smadja and McKewon, 1990; Smadja,1991). The 
novel aspect of our study is that we collect not only 
operational pairs, but triples, such as N_prep N, 
V_prep_N etc. In fact, the preposition convey 
important information on the nature of the semantic 
link between syntactically related content words. By 
looking at the preposition, it is possible to restrict 
the set of semantic relations underlying a syntactic 
relation (e.g. for=purpose,beneficiary). 
To extract syntactic associations two methods have 
been adopted in the literature. Smadja attempts to 
apply syntactic information to a set of automatically 
collected collocations (statistics-first). Hindle 
performs syntactic parsing before collocational 
analysis (syntax-first). In our study, we decided to 
adopt the syntax-first approach, because: 
- as remarked above, it is important to extract not 
only syntactic pairs, but also triples; 
- statistically collected associations miss some 
syntactic relation between distant words in 
coordinate constructions (usually the window in 
which word pairs are extracted is +-5) and couple 
many words that are not syntactically related. 
Even though (Smadja,1991) reports good 
performances of his system, it must be noticed that 
the precision and efficiency figures of the parser 
apply to a set of data that have been already 
(statistically) processed. Thus the actual 
precision and efficiency in extracting 
syntactically related words from the source corpus 
may be lower than expected. 
As in other similar works, the syntactic analyzer 
used in this study does not rely on a complete Italian 
grammar. The parser only detects the sur face  
syntactic relations between words. A full description 
of the analyzer is outside the scope of this paper (see 
(Marziali, 1991) for details). In short, the parser 
consists of a segmentation algorithm to cut texts into 
phrases (NP, PP, VP etc), and a phrase parser that is 
able to detect he following 15 links: N_V, V_N, 
N_ADJ, N N, N_prep_N, V_prep_N, N_prep_V, 
V_prep_V, N_cong_N, ADJ_cong_ADJ, V_ADV, 
ADV_cong_ADV, V_cong V, N_prep_ADJ, 
V_prep_ADJ. 
The segmentation algorithm is very simple. If the 
domain sublanguage is good Italian, sentence cutting 
is based on the presence ofverbs, punctuation, adverbs 
such as when, if, because, etc: For more jergal 
domains, such as the economic enterprise corpus, text 
cutting is based on heuristics uch as the detection of 
a word classified as "activity" (Fasolo et a1.,1990). 
In fact, this domain is characterized by absence of 
punctuation, ill formed sentences, long nested 
coordinate constructions. 
The phrase parser is based on DCG (Pereira and 
Warren,1980), the most complex part of which is the 
treatment of coordination. The grammar consists of 
about 20 rules. Rather than a parse tree, the output is 
a "fiat" set of syntactic relations between content 
words. For example, parsing the sentence: 
fabbrica di scarpe per uomo e per bambino 
(*manufacture of shoes for man and child) 
produces the following relations: 
N_prep N(fabbrica ,di,scarpe) 
N prep_N(fabbrica,per,uomo) 
N_prep_N(fabbrica,per,bambino) 
N_prep_N(scarpe,per,uomo) 
N_prep_N(scarpe,per,bambino) 
N_cong_N(uomo,e,bambino) 
Unlike Church and Hindle, we are not interested in
collecting binary or ternary relations between words 
within a sentence, but rather in detecting recurring 
binary syntactic associations in the corpus. For this 
purpose it is unnecessary to retrieve even partial 
parse trees. 
The complexity of the grammar is O(n2), that makes 
it computationally attractive for parsing large 
corpora. In (Marziali,1991) the efficiency and 
precision of this grammar with respect to the full se! 
of surface syntactic links detectable by a complete 
DCG grammar are evaluated to be 85% and 90%. The 
reference output adopted to perform the evaluation is
a syntactic graph (Seo and Simmons,1989)'. Syntactic 
graphs include in a unique graph the set of all 
possible parse trees. The evaluation was hand-made 
98
over a set of 100 sentences belonging to three domains: 
the economic corpus, the legal corpus, and a novel. 
The performances are better for the legal corpus and 
the novel, due to the ungrammaticality of the 
economic orpus. 
The relatively high efficiency rate, as compared 
with the figures reported in (Brent, 1991), are due to 
the fact that Italian morphology is far more complex 
than English. Once a good morphologic analyzer is 
available (the one used in our work is very well 
tested, and has first described in (Russo,1987)), 
problems such as verb detection, raised in (Brent, 
1991), are negligible. In addition, the text-cutting 
algorithm has positive effects on the precision. 
Despite this, we verified that about a 35% of the 
syntactic associations extracted from the economic 
corpus are semantically unrelated, due to syntactic 
ambiguity. As shown in the following sections, 
semantic clustering in part solves this problem, 
because semantically unrelated word pairs do not 
accumulate statistical relevance, except for very rare 
and unfortunate cases. 
In any case, we need more experiments to verify the 
effect of a more severe sentence cutting algorithm on 
the precision at detecting semantically related pairs. 
This issue is particularly relevant for ungrammatical 
texts, as in the economic orpus. 
3. Assigning semantic tags 
The set of syntactic associations extracted by the 
DCG parser are first clustered according to the 
cooccurring words and the type of syntactic link. A 
further clustering is performed based on the semantic 
tag associated to the cooccurring words. 
Clustering association data through semantic tagging 
has two important advantages: 
First, it improves significantly the reliability of 
association data, even for small corpora; 
Second, and more importantly, semantic tags make it 
explicit the semantic nature of word relations. 
Manually adding semantic tags to words may appear 
very expensive, but in fact it is not, if very broad, 
domain-dependent classes are selected. 
In our application, the following 13 categories were 
adopted: 
PHYSICAL_ACT (packaging, travel, build, etc.) 
MENTAL_ACT(sell, organize, handle, teach, etc.) 
HUMAN_ENTITY (shareholder, company, person, 
farmer, tailor, etc.) 
ANIMAL (cow, sheep, etc.) 
VEGETABLE (carrots, grape, rubber, coffee, etc.) 
MATERIAL (wood, iron, water, cement, etc.) 
BUILDING (mill, shop, house, grocery, etc.) 
BYPRODUCT (jam, milk, wine, drink, hide, etc.) 
ARTIFACT (item, brickwork, toy, table, wears, etc.) 
MACHINE (engine, tractor, grindstone,computer, etc.) 
PLACE (ground, field, territory, Italy, sea, etc.) 
QUALITY (green, chemical, coaxial, flexible, etc.) 
MANNER (chemically, by-hand, retail, etc.) 
These categories classify well enough the words 
which are found in the selected sub-corpus as a test- 
bed for our research. Some words received two tags: 
for example, there are sentences in which a 
BUILDING metonymically refers to the commercial 
ACT held in that building (e.g. "trade mills for the 
production.."); some word is both a BY_PRODUCT 
(e.g. "wood carving") or a MATERIAL (e.g. 
"handicrafts in wood"). Because the domain is very 
specific, double-tagging i s never due to polisemy. 
Once the definition of a semantic class is clearly 
stated, and with the help of a simple user interface, 
hand tagging a word is a matter of seconds. We 
adopted the policy that, whenever assigning a tag is 
not obvious, or none of the available tags seems 
adequate, the word is simply skipped. Unclassified 
words are less than 10% in our corpus. Overall, we 
classified over 5000 words (lemmata). The activity 
of classification was absolutely negligible in 
comparison with all the other activities in this 
research, both on the ground of time and required 
skill. 
Domain-dependent tags render the classification 
task more simple and ensure that the clustered 
association data are appropriate given the 
application. An obvious drawback is that it is 
necessary to re-classify many words  if the 
application domain changes significantly. For 
example, we are currently prepar ing a new 
experiment on a legal corpus. The domain is 
semantically more rich, hence we needed 15 classes. 
A first estimate revealed that about 30-40% of the 
words need to be re-classified using more appropriate 
semantic tags. 
4 Acquisition of selectional restrictions 
Clustered association data are at the basis of our 
method to detect the important  selectional 
restrictions that hold in a given sublanguage. The 
statistical significance of the detected relations is 
measured by the probability of cooccurrence of two 
classes C 1 and C 2 in the pattern C 1 synt-rel C2, 
where synt-rel is one of the syntactic relations 
detectable by the parser summarized in Section 2. 
99
Rather than evaluating the probability Pr(C 1 synt- 
rel C2), we computed the conditioned probability 
P(C1,C2/synt-rel) estimated by: 
f(Cl,synt rel,C 2 ) 
(1) 
f(synt_rel) 
The reason for using (1) rather than other measures 
proposed in the literature, is that what matters here 
is to detect all the statistically relevant phenomena, 
not necessarily all the meaningful associations. Such 
measures as the mutual information and the t-score 
(Church et al., 1991) give emphasis to the infrequent 
phenomena, because the statistical significance of 
the coupling between C 1 and C 2 is related to the 
probability of occurrence of C 1 and C 2 independently 
from each other. This would be useful at detecting 
rare but meaningful relations if one could rely on the 
correctness of the data. Unfortunately, due to 
syntactic ambiguity and errors in parsing, many 
syntactic associations are not semantically related, 
i.e. there exists no plausible selectional relations 
between the to cooccurring words. Using the mutual 
information, such relations could accumulate 
statistical evidence. The (1) is more conservative, but 
ensures more reliable results. In any case, we run 
several exper iments  with different statistical 
measures, without being entirely happy with any of 
these. Finding more appropriate statistical methods 
is one of the future objectives of our work. 
Clustered association data are used to build tables, 
one for each syntactic structure, whose element (x,y) 
represents the statistical significance in the corpus of 
a concept pair C 1 C 2. All the relevant couplings 
among classes are identified by a human operator 
who inspects the tables, and labels concept pairs by 
the appropriate conceptual relation. Finding an 
appropriate set of conceptual relations is not an easy 
task. In labeling concept pairs, we relied on our 
preceding work on semantic representation with 
Conceptual Graph \[Pazienza nd Velardi, 1987\]. 
Four of these tables are presented in the Appendix. 
The data have been collected from a corpus of about 
500,000 words. The morphosyntactic analyzer takes 
about 6-10 hours on a Spark station. Clustering the 
data takes about as much. At first, we extracted only 
the V_N, N_prep N and V_prep_N associations, 
for a total of 52,155 different syntactic associations. 
The average is 5 occurrences for each association. 
At first glance, the data seem quite odd even to an 
Italian reader, but it turns out that the tables show 
exactly what the corpus includes. Let us briefly go 
through the 4 tables. 
Table 1 summarizes the relations C l -per -C  2 
(per=for). Some of the significant associations are: 
ARTIFACT - PHYSICAL_ACT (e.g.: articoli per Io 
sport (*items for sport), attrezzi per giardinaggio 
(*tools for gardening)) 
ARTIFACT - BUILDING (e.g. biancheria per la casa 
(*linens for the house), mobili per negozi (*furnitures 
for shops)) 
MACHINE-BUILDING (e.g. macchinari per 
laboratori (*equipments for laboratories), macine per 
mulini (*grindstones for mills)) 
All the above relations subsume the usage (or 
figurative_destination) relation. 
Notice that the "advertised" beneficiary relation is 
not very significant in the corpus. The only 
statistically relevant beneficiary relations are 
ARTIFACT-for-HUMAN_ENTITY ( ( e.g. calzature 
per uomo (*shoes for man), biancheria per signora 
( * l inens  fo r  lady) )  and 
HUMAN_ENTITY_ for_HUMANENTITY  (e.g. 
parrucchire per signora (*hairdresser for lady). It 
appears that in the considered omain, verbs, except 
for some, poorly relate with the preposition for (this 
is the first surprise!). 
Table 2 shows the Cl-in-C 2 relations. Two relations 
represent the large majority: 
ARTIFACT-in- BYPRODUCT (e.g. calzature in 
pelle (*shoes in leather), guarnizioni in gomma 
(packings in rubber)) 
ARTIFACT-in-MATERIAL (e.g. oggetti in legnc 
(*handicrafts in wood) ringhiere in ferro (*banisters 
in iron)) 
both subsume a matter elation (this is one of the few 
"expected" associations we found). 
Less frequent but interesting are the followin~ 
relations: 
MENTAL_ACT-in-MENTAL_ACT (e.g. concedere ir~ 
appalto (*to grant in bid) acquistare in leasing (*to 
buy in leasing)) 
ARTIFACT-in-ARTIFACT (e.g. prodotti in scatok 
(*products in can)) 
While the second is a "reassuring" location relatior 
(subsumed also by the in-PLACE associations in th( 
last column), we are less sure about the semanti( 
interpretation of the first relation. Tentatively, w( 
choosed the manner relation. The same type o: 
relation is also found in the CI-a-C 2 (a=to,on) tabh 
(Table 3): MENTAL_ACT-a-MENTAL_ACT (e.g 
acquistare a credito (*to buy to (=on) credit) 
abilitare all'ottenimento (*qualifying to th4 
attainment), assistenza ll'insegnamento (assistenc, 
to the teaching)) 
100
The first example (on credit) clearly subsumes the 
same relation as for in leasing; the following two 
seem of a different nature. We used figurative- 
destination to label these relations. This may or may 
not be the best interpretation: however, what 
matters here is not so much the human interpretation 
of the data, but rather the ability of the system at 
detecting the relevant semantic associations, 
whatever their name could be. 
Once again in this table, notice that the common 
relations, like recipient (to-HUMAN_ENTITY) and 
destination (to-PLACE) are less frequent than 
expected. 
Table 4 shows the C l -da -C  2 re la t ions  
(da=from,for, to). The most frequent relations are: 
MATERIAL-da-PHYSICAL_ACT (e.g materiali da 
imballaggio (*material from (=for) packing) legna 
da ardere (*wood from (=to) burn)) 
ARTIFACT-da-ARTIFACT (e.g cera da pavimenti 
(*wax for floors), lenzuola da letto (*sheets for bed)) 
ARTIFACT-da-PLACE (e.g giocattoli da mare (*toys 
for sea) abiti da montagna (*wears for mountain) 
MENTAL_ACT-da-BUILDING (e.g acquistare da 
fabbrica (*to buy from firms), comprare da oleifici 
(*to buy from oil-mills)) 
The first three relations, very frequent in the corpus, 
all subsume the usage relation. It is interesting to 
notice that in Italian "da+PLACE" commonly  
subsumes a source relation, just as in English 
(from+PLACE). The table however shows that this 
is not the case, at least when "from-PLACE" cooccurs 
with classes uch as ARTIFACT and MATERIAL. The 
classical source sense is found in the fourth example. 
BUILDINGs here metonymically refer to the human 
organization that manages an activity in the 
building. 
Currently we are unable to analyze the preposition di 
(*of), because in the corpus it is used for the large 
majority to subsume the direct-object syntactic 
relation (e.g. vendita di frutta *sale of fruit). It turns 
out that the distribution of Cl-di-C 2 is too even to 
allow an analysis of the data. Perhaps a less crude 
parsing strategy could help at ruling out these 
associations. 
A new domain is now under examination (a legal 
corpus on taxation orms). A first analysis of the data 
shows that even for this corpus, despite it is much 
less jergal, several unconventional relations hold 
between content words. 
5. Final Remarks 
We spent some time at illustrating the tables to make 
the reader more confident with the data, and to show 
with several practical examples the thesis of this 
paper, i.e. that selectional restrictions are more 
fanciful than what usually appears from the 
literature on computational lexicons (and from 
dictionaries as well). The reader should not think 
that we selected for our application the oddest 
domain we could find: similar (as for fancifulness) 
data are being extracted from a legal corpus which is 
currently under examination. 
The (semi-)automatic acquisition of selectional 
restrictions is only one ot the things that can be 
learned using clustered association data. In a 
forthcoming paper (Basili et al., forthcoming) the 
same data, clustered only by the right-hand word, 
are at the basis of a very reliable algorithm for 
syntactic disambiguation. We are also experimenting 
concept formation algorithms for verb and noun 
classification (Fabrizi et al., forthcoming). 
In summary, clustered associations in our view 
greatly improve the reliability and applicability of 
studies on word associations. More work is necessary, 
because of semantic tagging, but there is an evident 
payoff. In any case, semantic tagging is not at all the 
most painful manual activity in association studies.
