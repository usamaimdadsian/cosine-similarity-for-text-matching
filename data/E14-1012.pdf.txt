Abstract 
In this paper, we present a series of 
experiments in which we analyze the usage of 
graffiti style features for signaling personal 
gang identification in a large, online street 
gangs forum, with an accuracy as high as 83% 
at the gang alliance level and 72% for the 
specific gang.  We then build on that result in 
predicting how members of different gangs 
signal the relationship between their gangs 
within threads where they are interacting with 
one another, with a predictive accuracy as high 
as 66% at this thread composition prediction 
task.  Our work demonstrates how graffiti 
style features signal social identity both in 
terms of personal group affiliation and 
between group alliances and oppositions.  
When we predict thread composition by 
modeling identity and relationship 
simultaneously using a multi-domain learning 
framework paired with a rich feature 
representation, we achieve significantly higher 
predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art 
baselines using one or the other in isolation. 
1 Introduction 
Analysis of linguistic style in social media has 
grown in popularity over the past decade.  
Popular prediction problems within this space 
include gender classification (Argamon et al., 
2003), age classification (Argamon et al., 2007), 
political affiliation classification (Jiang & 
Argamon, 2008), and sentiment analysis (Wiebe 
et al., 2004).  From a sociolinguistic perspective, 
this work can be thought of as fitting within the 
area of machine learning approaches to the 
analysis of style (Biber & Conrad, 2009), 
perhaps as a counterpart to work by variationist 
sociolinguists in their effort to map out the space 
of language variation and its accompanying 
social interpretation (Labov, 2010; Eckert & 
Rickford, 2001).  One aspiration of work in 
social media analysis is to contribute to this 
literature, but that requires that our models are 
interpretable.  The contribution of this paper is an 
investigation into the ways in which stylistic 
features behave in the language of participants of 
a large online community for street gang 
members.  We present a series of experiments 
that reveal new challenges in modeling stylistic 
variation with machine learning approaches.  As 
we will argue, the challenge is achieving high 
predictive accuracy without sacrificing 
interpretability. 
 Gang language is a type of sociolect that has 
so far not been the focus of modeling in the area 
of social media analysis.  Nevertheless, we argue 
that the gangs forum we have selected as our 
data source provides a strategic source of data for 
exploring how social context influences stylistic 
language choices, in part because it is an area 
where the dual goals of predictive accuracy and 
interpretability are equally important. In 
particular, evidence that gang related crime may 
account for up to 80% of crime in the United 
States attests to the importance of understanding 
the social practices of this important segment of 
society (Johnsons, 2009).  Expert testimony 
attributing meaning to observed, allegedly gang-
related social practices is frequently used as 
evidence of malice in criminal investigations 
(Greenlee, 2010).  Frequently, it is police officers 
who are given the authority to serve as expert 
witnesses on this interpretation because of their 
routine interaction with gang members.  
107
Nevertheless, one must consider their lack of 
formal training in forensic linguistics (Coulthard 
& Johnson, 2007) and the extent to which the 
nature of their interaction with gang members 
may subject them to a variety of cognitive biases 
that may threaten the validity of their 
interpretation (Kahneman, 2011).   
 Gang-related social identities are known to be 
displayed through clothing, tattoos, and language 
practices including speech, writing, and gesture 
(Valentine, 1995), and even dance (Philips, 
2009).  Forensic linguists have claimed that these 
observed social practices have been over-
interpreted and inaccurately interpreted where 
they have been used as evidence in criminal trials 
and that they may have even resulted in 
sentences that are not justified by sufficient 
evidence (Greenlee, 2010).  Sociolinguistic 
analysis of language varieties associated with 
gangs and other counter-cultural groups attests to 
the challenges in reliable interpretation of such 
practices (Bullock, 1996; Lefkowitz, 1989).  If 
we as a community can understand better how 
stylistic features behave due to the choices 
speakers make in social contexts, we will be in a 
better position to achieve high predictive 
accuracy with models that are nevertheless 
interpretable.  And ultimately, our models may 
offer insights into usage patterns of these social 
practices that may then offer a more solid 
empirical foundation for interpretation and use of 
language as evidence in criminal trials. 
 In the remainder of the paper we describe our 
annotated corpus.  We then motivate the 
technical approach we have taken to modeling 
linguistic practices within the gangs forum.  
Next, we present a series of experiments 
evaluating our approach and conclude with a 
discussion of remaining challenges. 
2 The Gangs Forum Corpus 
The forum that provides data for our experiments 
is an online forum for members of street gangs. 
The site was founded in November, 2006. It was 
originally intended to be an educational resource 
compiling knowledge about the various gang 
organizations and the street gang lifestyle. Over 
time, it became a social outlet for gang members. 
There are still traces of this earlier focus in that 
there are links at the top of each page to websites 
dedicated to information about particular gangs. 
At the time of scraping its contents, it had over a 
million posts and over twelve thousand active 
users.   Our work focuses on analysis of stylistic 
choices that are influenced by social context, so 
it is important to consider some details about the 
social context of this forum.  Specifically, we 
discuss which gangs are present in the data and 
how the gangs are organized into alliances and 
rivalries.  Users are annotated with their gang 
identity at two levels of granularity, and threads 
are annotated with labels that indicate which 
gang dominates and how the participating gangs 
relate to one another.   
2.1 User-Level Annotations 
At the fine-grained level, we annotated users 
with the gang that they indicated being affiliated 
with,  including Bloods, Crips, Hoovers, 
Gangster Disciples, other Folk Nation, Latin 
Kings, Vice Lords, Black P. Stones, other People 
Nation, Trinitarios, Norteños, and Sureños.  
There was also an Other category for the smaller 
gangs.  For a coarser grained annotation of gang 
affiliation, we also noted the nation, otherwise 
known as gang alliance, each gang was 
associated with.   
For our experiments, a sociolinguist with 
significant domain expertise annotated the gang 
identity of 3384 users.  Information used in our 
annotation included the user?s screen name, their 
profile, which included a slot for gang affiliation, 
and the content of their posts.  We used regular 
expressions to find gang names or other 
identifiers occurring within the gang affiliation 
field and the screen names and annotated the 
users that matched.  If the value extracted for the 
two fields conflicted, we marked them as 
claiming multiple gangs.  For users whose 
affiliation could not be identified automatically, 
we manually checked their profile to see if their 
avatar (an image that accompanies their posts) or 
other fields there contained any explicit 
information.  Otherwise, we skimmed their posts 
for explicit statements of gang affiliation.   
Affiliation was unambiguously identified 
automatically for 56% of the 3384 users from 
their affiliation field.  Another 36% were 
identified automatically based on their screen 
name.  Manual inspection was only necessary in 
9% of the cases.  Users that remained ambiguous, 
were clearly fake or joke accounts, or who 
claimed multiple gangs were grouped together in 
an “Other” category, which accounts for 6.2% of 
the total.  Thus, 94% of the users were classified 
into the 12 specific gangs mentioned above. 
108
At a coarse-grained level, users were also 
associated with a nation.  The nation category 
was inspired by the well-known gang alliances 
known as the People Nation and Folks Nation, 
which are city-wide alliances of gangs in 
Chicago. We labeled the Crips and Hoovers as a 
nation since they are closely allied gangs.  
Historically, the Hoovers began breaking away 
from the Crips and are rivals with certain subsets 
of Crips, but allies with the majority of other 
Crips gangs.  The complex inner structure of the 
Crips alliance will be discussed in Section 5 
where we interpret our quantitative results. 
There are a large number of gangs that 
comprise the People and Folks Nations. The 
major gangs within the People Nation are the 
Latin Kings, Vice Lords and Black P. Stones. 
The Folks Nation is dominated by the Gangster 
Disciples with other Folks Nation gangs being 
significantly smaller. The People Nation, Blood 
and Norteños gangs are in a loose, national 
alliance against the opposing national alliance of 
the Folks Nation, Crips and Sureños. Remaining 
gangs were annotated as other, such as the 
Trinitarios, that don't fit into this national 
alliance system nor even smaller alliances.   
2.2 Thread-Level Annotations 
In addition to person-level annotations of gang 
and nation, we also annotated 949 threads with 
dominant gang as well as thread composition, by 
which we mean whether the users who 
participated on the thread were only from allied 
gangs, included opposing gangs, or contained a 
mix of gangs that were neither opposing nor 
allied.  These 949 threads were ones where a 
majority of the users who posted were in the set 
of 3384 users annotated with a gang identity. 
For the dominant gang annotation at the 
gang level, we consider only participants on the 
thread for whom there was an annotated gang 
affiliation. If members of a single gang produced 
the majority of the posts in the thread, then that 
was annotated as the dominant gang of the thread. 
If no gang had a majority in the thread, it was 
instead labeled as Mixed. For dominant gang at 
the nation level, the same procedure was used, 
but instead of looking for which gang accounted 
for more of the members, we looked for which 
gang alliance accounted for the majority of users. 
For the thread composition annotation, we 
treated the Bloods, People Nation, and Norteños 
as allied with each other as the “Red set”.  We 
treated Crips, Hoovers, Folks Nation, and 
Sureños as allies with each other as the “Blue 
set”.  The Red and Blue sets oppose one another.  
The Latin Kings and Trinitarios also oppose one 
another.  Thread composition was labeled as 
Allied, Mixed or Opposing depending on the 
gangs that appeared in the thread. As with the 
dominant gang annotation, only annotated users 
were considered. If all of the posts were by users 
of the same gang or allied gangs, the thread was 
labeled as Allied.  If there were any posts from 
rival gangs, it was labeled as Opposing. 
Otherwise, it was labeled as Mixed. If the users 
were all labeled with Other as their gang it was 
also labeled as Mixed.  
3 Modeling Language Practices at the 
Feature Level 
In this section, we first describe the rich feature 
representation we developed for this work.  
Finally, we discuss the motivation for employing 
a multi-domain learning framework in our 
machine-learning experiments. 
3.1 Feature Space Design: Graffiti Style 
Features 
While computational work modeling gang-
related language practices is scant, we can learn 
lessons from computational work on other types 
of sociolects that may motivate a reasonable 
approach.  Gender prediction, for example, is a 
problem where there have been numerous 
publications in the past decade (Corney et al., 
2002; Argamon et al., 2003; Schler et al., 2005; 
Schler, 2006; Yan & Yan, 2006; Zhang et al., 
2009).  Because of the complex and subtle way 
gender influences language choices, it is a 
strategic example to motivate our work. 
 Gender-based language variation arises from 
multiple sources. Among these, it has been noted 
that within a single corpus comprised of samples 
of male and female language that the two 
genders do not speak or write about the same 
topics. This is problematic because word-based 
features such as unigrams and bigrams, which 
are very frequently used, are highly likely to pick 
up on differences in topic (Schler, 2006) and 
possibly perspective. Thus, in cases where 
linguistic style variation is specifically of 
interest, these features do not offer good 
generalizability (Gianfortoni et al., 2011). 
Similarly, in our work, members of different 
109
gangs are located in different areas associated 
with different concerns and levels of 
socioeconomic status.  Thus, in working to 
model the stylistic choices of gang forum 
members, it is important to consider how to 
avoid overfitting to content-level distinctions. 
 Typical kinds of features that have been used 
in gender prediction apart from unigram features 
include part-of-speech (POS) ngrams (Argamon 
et al., 2003), word-structure features that cluster 
words according to endings that indicate part of 
speech (Zhang et al., 2009), features that indicate 
the distribution of word lengths within a corpus 
(Corney et al., 2002), usage of punctuation, and 
features related to usage of jargon (Schler et al., 
2005). In Internet-based communication, 
additional features have been investigated such 
as usage of internet specific features including 
“internet speak” (e.g., lol, wtf, etc.), emoticons, 
and URLs (Yan & Yan, 2006).

Table 1: Orthographical substitutions from gang 
graffiti symbolism 
 
 In order to place ourselves in the best position 
to build an interpretable model, our space of 
graffiti style features was designed based on a 
combination of qualitative observations of the 
gangs forum data and reading about gang 
communication using web accessible resources 
such as informational web pages linked to the 
forum and other resources related to gang 
communication (Adams & Winter, 1997; Garot, 
2007).  Specifically, in our corpus we observed 
gang members using what we refer to as graffiti 
style features to mark their identity.  Gang 
graffiti employs shorthand references to convey 
affiliation or threats (Adams & Winter, 
1997).  For example, the addition of a <k> after a 
letter representing a rival gang stands for “killer.” 
So, writing <ck> would represent “crip killer.” A 
summary of these substitutions can be seen in 
Table 1.  Unfortunately, only about 25% of the 
users among the 12,000 active users employ 
these features in their posts, which limits their 
ability to achieve a high accuracy, but 
nevertheless offers the opportunity to model a 
frequent social practice observed in the corpus.  
 The graffiti style features were extracted 
using a rule-based algorithm that compares 
words against a standard dictionary as well as 
using some phonotactic constraints on the 
position of certain letters.  The dictionary was 
constructed using all of the unique words found 
in the AQUAINT corpus (Graff, 2002).  If a 
word in a post did not match any word from the 
AQUAINT corpus, we tested it against each of 
the possible transformations in Table 1.  
Transformations were applied to words using 
finite state transducers.  If some combination 
transformations from that table applied to the 
observed word could produce some term from 
the AQUAINT corpus, then we counted that 
observed word as containing the features 
associated with the applied transformations. 
 The transformations were applied in the order 
of least likely to occur in normal text to the most 
likely. Since „bk? only occurs in a handful of 
obscure words, for example, almost any 
occurrence of it can be assumed to be a 
substitution and the „k? can safely be removed 
before the next step. By contrast, „cc? and „ck? 
occur in many common words so they must be 
saved for last to ensure that the final dictionary 
checks have any simultaneous substitutions 
already removed. 
 When computing values for the graffiti style 
features for a text, the value for each feature was 
computed as the number of words (tokens) that 
contained the feature divided by the total number 
of words (tokens) in the document.  We used a 
set of 13 of these features, chosen on the basis of 
how frequently they occurred and how strongly 
they distinguished gangs from one another (for 
example, substituting „$? for „s? was a 
transformation that was common across gangs in 
110
our qualitative analysis, and thus did not seem 
beneficial to include).

Table 2: Evaluation of extraction of graffiti style 
features over the million post corpus 
 
 The feature-extraction approach was 
developed iteratively. After extracting the 
features over the corpus of 12,000 active users, 
we created lists of words where the features were 
detected, sorted by frequency. We then manually 
examined the words to determine where we 
observed errors occurring and then made some 
minor adjustments to the extractors.  Table 2 
displays a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy 
of the graffiti style feature extraction. 
 Performance of the style features was 
estimated for each style-feature rule.  For each 
rule, we compute a false positive and false 
negative rate.  For false positive rate, we begin 
by retrieving the list of words marked by the 
feature extraction rule containing the associated 
style marking. From the full set of words that 
matched a style feature rule, we selected the 200 
most frequently occurring word types.  We 
manually checked that complete set of word 
tokens and counted the number of misfires.  The 
false positive rate was then calculated for each 
feature by dividing the number of tokens that 
were misfires over the total number of tokens in 
the set. In all cases, we ensured that at least 55% 
of the total word tokens were covered, so 
additional words may have been examined.  
 In the case of false negatives, we started with 
the set of word types that did not match any word 
in the dictionary and also did not trigger the style 
feature rule.  Again we sorted word types in this 
list by frequency and selected the top 200 most 
frequent.  We then manually checked for missed 
instances where the associated style feature was 
used but not detected.  The false negative rate 
was then the total number of word tokens within 
this word type set divided by the total number of 
word tokens in the complete set of word types. 
 Another type of feature we used referenced 
the nicknames gangs used for themselves and 
other gangs, which we refer to as Names features.  
The intuition behind this is simple: someone who 
is a member of the Crips gang will talk about the 
Crips more often. The measure is simply how 
often a reference to a gang occurs per document. 
Some of these nicknames we included were 
gang-specific insults, with the idea that if 
someone uses insults for Crips often, they are 
likely not a Crip. The last type of reference is 
words that refer to gang alliances like the People 
Nation and Folks Nation. Members of those 
Chicago-based gangs frequently refer to their 
gang as the “Almighty [gang name] Nation”.

Table 3: Patterns used for gang name features.  For all 
gangs listed in the table, there are slang terms used as 
positive mentions of the gang.  For some gangs there 
are also typical insult names. 
 
We used regular expressions to capture 
occurrences of these words and variations on 
them such as the use of the orthographic 
substitutions mentioned previously, plurals, 
feminine forms, etc. Additionally, in the Blood 
and Hoover features, they sometimes use 
numbers to replace the „o?s representing the 
street that their gang is located on. So the Bloods 
from 34th Street, say, might write “Bl34d”.

3.2 Computational Paradigm: Multi-
domain learning 
The key to training an interpretable model in our 
work is to pair a rich feature representation with 
a model that enables accounting for the structure 
of the social context explicitly.  Recent work in 
the area of multi-domain learning offers such an 
opportunity (Arnold, 2009; Daumé III, 2007; 
Finkel & Manning, 2009).  In our work, we treat 
the dominant gang of a thread as a domain for 
the purpose of detecting thread composition.  
This decision is based on the observation that 
while it is a common practice across gangs to 
express their attitudes towards allied and 
opposing gangs using stylistic features like the 
Graffiti style features, the particular features that 
serve the purpose of showing affiliation or 
opposition differ by gang.  Thus, it is not the 
features themselves that carry significance, but 
rather a combination of who is saying it and how 
it is being said. 
 As a paradigm for multi-domain learning, we 
use Daume?s Frustratingly Easy Domain 
Adaptation approach (Daumé III, 2007) as 
implemented in LightSIDE (Mayfield & Rosé, 
2013). In this work, Daumé III proposes a very 
simple “easy adapt” approach, which was 
originally proposed in the context of adapting to 
a specific target domain, but easily generalizes to 
multi-domain learning. The key idea is to create 
domain-specific versions of the original input 
features depending on which domain a data point 
belongs to. The original features represent a 
domain-general feature space. This allows any 
standard learner to appropriately optimize the 
weights of domain-specific and domain-general 
features simultaneously.  In our work, this allows 
us to model how different gangs signal within-
group identification and across-group animosity 
or alliance using different features.  The resulting 
model will enable us to identify how gangs differ 
in their usage of style features to display social 
identity and social relations. 
 It has been noted in prior work that style is 
often expressed in a topic-specific or even 
domain-specific way (Gianfortoni et al., 2011).  
What exacerbates these problems in text 
processing approaches is that texts are typically 
represented with features that are at the wrong 
level of granularity for what is being 
modeled.  Specifically, for practical reasons, the 
most common types of features used in text 
classification tasks are still unigrams, bigrams, 
and part-of-speech bigrams, which are highly 
prone to over-fitting. When text is represented 
with features that operate at too fine-grained of a 
level, features that truly model the target style are 
not present within the model.  Thus, the trained 
models are not able to capture the style itself and 
instead capture features that correlate with that 
style within the data (Gianfortoni et al., 2011). 
 This is particularly problematic in cases 
where the data is not independent and identically 
distributed (IID), and especially where instances 
that belong to different subpopulations within the 
non-IID data have different class value 
distributions.  In those cases, the model will tend 
to give weight to features that indicate the 
subpopulation rather than features that model the 
style.   Because of this insight from prior work, 
we contrast our stylistic features with unigram 
features and our multi-domain approach with a 
single-domain approach wherever appropriate in 
our experiments presented in Section 4. 
4 Prediction Experiments 
In this section we present a series of prediction 
experiments using the annotations described in 
Section 2.  We begin by evaluating our ability to 
identify gang affiliation for individual users.  
Because we will use dominant gang as a domain 
feature in our multi-domain learning approach to 
detect thread composition, we also present an 
evaluation of our ability to automatically predict 
dominant gang for a thread.  Finally, we evaluate 
our ability to predict thread composition.  All of 
our experiments use L1 regularized Logistic 
regression. 
4.1 Predicting Gang Affiliation per User 
The first set of prediction experiments we ran 
was to identify gang affiliation.  For this 
experiment, the full set of posts contributed by a 
user was concatenated together and used as a 
document from which to extract text features.  
We conducted this experiment using a 10-fold 
cross-validation over the full set of users 
annotated for gang affiliation. Results contrasting 
alternative feature spaces at the gang level and 
nation level are displayed in Table 4.  We begin 
with a unigram feature space as the baseline.  We 
contrast this with the Graffiti style features 
described above in Section 3.1.  Because all of 
the Graffiti features are encoded in words as 
pairs of characters, we contrast the carefully 
extracted Graffiti style features with character 
112
bigrams.  Next we test the nickname features 
also described in Section 3.1.  Finally, we test 
combinations of these features.   
 Gang Nation 
Unigrams 70% 81% 
Character Bigrams 64% 76% 
Graffiti Features 44% 68% 
Name Features 63% 78% 
Name + Graffiti 67% 81% 
Unigrams + Name 70% 82% 
Unigrams + Character 
Bigrams 
71% 82% 
Unigrams + Graffiti 71% 82% 
Unigrams + Name  + 
Graffiti 
72% 83% 
Unigrams + Name  + 
Character Bigrams 
72% 79% 
Table 4: Results (percent accuracy) for gang 
affiliation prediction at the gang and nation level. 
  
     We note that the unigram space is a 
challenging feature space to beat, possibly 
because only about 25% of the users employ the 
style features we identified with any regularity.  
The character bigram space actually significantly 
outperforms the Graffiti features, in part because 
it captures aspects of both the Graffiti features, 
the name features, and also some other gang 
specific jargon.  When we combine the stylistic 
features with unigrams, we start to see an 
advantage over unigrams alone.  The best 
combination is Unigrams, Graffiti style features, 
and Name features, at 72% accuracy (.65 Kappa) 
at the gang level and 83% accuracy (.69 Kappa) 
at the nation level.  Overall the accuracy is 
reasonable and offers us the opportunity to 
expand our analysis of social practices on the 
gangs forum to a much larger sample in our 
future work than we present in this first foray. 
4.2 Predicting Dominant Gang per Thread 
In Section 4.3 we present our multi-domain 
learning approach to predicting thread 
composition.  In that work, we use dominant 
gang on a thread as a domain.  In those 
experiments, we contrast results with hand-
annotated dominant gang and automatically-
predicted dominant gang.  In order to compute an 
automatically-identified dominant gang for the 
949 threads used in that experiment, we build a 
model for gang affiliation prediction using data 
from the 2689 users who did not participate on 
any of those threads as training data so there is 
no overlap in users between train and test. 
     The feature space for that classifier included 
unigrams, character bigrams, and the gang name 
features since this feature space tied for best 
performing at the gang level in Section 4.1 and 
presents a slightly lighter weight solution than 
Unigrams, graffiti style features, and gang name 
features. We applied that trained classifier to the 
users who participated on the 949 threads.  From 
the automatically-predicted gang affiliations, we 
computed a dominant gang using the gang and 
nation level for each thread using the same rules 
that we applied to the annotated user identities 
for the annotated dominant gang labels described 
in Section 2.2.  We then evaluated our 
performance by comparing the automatically-
identified dominant gang with the more carefully 
annotated one.  Our automatically identified 
dominant gang labels were 73.3% accurate (.63 
Kappa) at the gang level and 76.6% accurate (.72 
Kappa) at the nation level. This experiment is 
mainly important as preparation for the 
experiment presented in Section 4.3. 
4.3 Predicting Thread Composition 
Our final and arguably most important prediction 
experiments were for prediction of thread 
composition.  This is where we begin to 
investigate how stylistic choices reflect the 
relationships between participants in a 
discussion.  We conducted this experiment twice, 
specifically, once with the annotated dominant 
gang labels (Table 5) and once with the 
automatically predicted ones (Table 6).  In both 
cases, we evaluate gang and nation as alternative 
domain variables.  In both sets of experiments, 
the multi-domain versions significantly 
outperform the baseline across a variety of 
feature spaces, and the stylistic features provide 
benefit above the unigram baseline.  In both 
tables the domain and nation variables are hand-
annotated. * indicates the results are significantly 
better than the no domain unigram baseline.  
Underline indicates best result per column.  And 
bold indicates overall best result.  
     The best performing models in both cases 
used a multi-domain model paired with a stylistic 
feature space rather than a unigram space.  Both 
models performed significantly better than any of 
the unigram models, even the multi-domain 
versions with annotated domains. Where gang 
was used as the domain variable and Graffiti 
style features were the features used for 
prediction, we found that the high weight 
features associated with Allied threads were 
113
either positive about gang identity for a variety 
of gangs other than their own (like B^ in a Crips 
dominated thread) or protective (like CC in a 
Bloods dominated thread).

Crips-related features were the most frequent 
within this set, perhaps because of the complex 
social structure within the Crips alliance, as 
discussed above.  We saw neither features 
associated with negative attitudes of the gang 
towards others nor other gangs towards them in 
these Allied threads, but in opposing threads, we 
see both, for example, PK in Crips threads or BK 
in Bloods threads.  Where unigrams are used as 
the feature space, the high weight features are 
almost exclusively in the general space rather 
than the domain space, and are generally 
associated with attitude directly rather than gang 
identity.  For example, “lol,” and “wtf.” 
5 Conclusions  
We have presented a series of experiments in 
which we have analyzed the usage of stylistic 
features for signaling personal gang 
identification and between gang relations in a 
large, online street gangs forum.  This first foray 
into modeling the language practices of gang 
members is one step towards providing an 
empirical foundation for interpretation of these 
practices.  In embarking upon such an endeavor, 
however, we must use caution.  In machine-
learning approaches to modeling stylistic 
variation, a preference is often given to 
accounting for variance over interpretability, 
with the result that interpretability of models is 
sacrificed in order to achieve a higher prediction 
accuracy.  Simple feature encodings such as 
unigrams are frequently chosen in a (possibly 
misguided) attempt to avoid bias.  As we have 
discussed above, however, rather than cognizant 
introduction of bias informed by prior linguistic 
work, unknown bias is frequently introduced 
because of variables we have not accounted for 
and confounding factors we are not aware of, 
especially in social data that is rarely IID. Our 
results suggest that a strategic combination of 
rich feature encodings and structured modeling 
approach leads to high accuracy and 
interpretability.  In our future work, we will use 
our models to investigate language practices in 
the forum at large rather than the subset of users 
and threads used in this paper1.
