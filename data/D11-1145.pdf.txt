Twitter Catches The Flu: Detecting Influenza Epidemics using Twitter

With the recent rise in popularity and scale of social media, a growing need exists for systems that can extract useful information from huge amounts of data. We address the issue of detecting influenza epidemics. First, the proposed system extracts influen-za related tweets using Twitter API. Then, only tweets that mention actual influenza patients are extracted by the support vector machine (SVM) based classifier. The ex-periment results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach (0.89 correlation to the gold standard). Especially at the out-break and early spread (early epidemic stage), the proposed method shows high correlation (0.97 correlation), which out-performs the state-of-the-art methods. This paper describes that Twitter texts reflect the real world, and that NLP techniques can be applied to extract only tweets that contain useful information. 
1 Introduction Twitter1, a popular micro-blogging service, has received much attention recently. It is an online network used by millions of people around the world to stay connected to their friends, family members, and co-workers through their computers and mobile telephones (Milstein et al., 2010). Nowadays, Twitter users have increased rapidly. Its community estimated as 120 million worldwide,                                                            1 http://twitter.com/ 
posts more than 5.5 million messages (tweets) eve-ry day (reported by Twitter.com in March 2011). Twitter can potentially serve as a valuable infor-mation resource for various applications. Huber-man et al. (2009) analyzed the relations among friends. Boyd et al. (2010) investigated commuta-tion activity. Sakaki et al. (2010) addressed the detection of earthquakes. Among the numerous potential applications, this study addresses the is-sue of detecting influenza epidemics, which pre-sents two outstanding advantages over current methods.  ? Large Scale: More than a thousand messages include the word “influenza” each day (Nov. 2008 – Oct. 2009). Such a huge data volume dwarfs traditional surveillance resources.  ? Real-time: Twitter enables real-time and di-rect surveillance. This characteristic is ex-tremely suitable for influenza epidemic detection because early stage detection is im-portant for influenza warnings.  Although Twitter based influenza warnings poten-tially offer the advantages noted above, it might also expose inaccurate or biased information from tweets like the following (brackets []	   indicate the comments):  ? Headache? You might have flu. [Suspi-­?cions]	  ? The World Health Organization reports the avian influenza, or bird flu, epidemic has spread to nine Asian countries in the past few weeks. [General	  News]

? Are you coming down with influenza? [Question]  Although these tweets include mention of “influ-enza” or “flu”, they do not indicate that an influen-za patient is present nearby. We regard such messages (merely suspicions/questions, general news, etc.) as negative influenza tweets. We call others positive influenza tweets. In our experi-ments, 42% of all tweets that include “influenza” are negative influenza tweets. The huge volume of such negative tweets biases the results. This paper presents a proposal of a machine-learning based classifier to filter out negative in-fluenza tweets. First, we build an annotated corpus of pairs of a tweet and positive/negative labels. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) based sentence classifier extracts only positive influenza tweets from tweets. In the experiments, the results demonstrated the high cor-relation (0.89 of the correlation), which is equal performance to that of the state-of-the-art method.  The specified research point of this study is two-fold: (1) This report describes that an SVM-based clas-sifier can filter out the negative influenza tweets (f-measure=0.76). (2) Experiments empirically demonstrate that the proposed method detects the influenza epidem-ics with high accuracy (correlation ratio=0.89): it outperforms the state-of-the-art method. 2 Influenza Epidemic Detection The detection of influenza epidemics is a national mission in every country for two reasons. (1) Anti-influenza drugs, which differ among in-fluenza types, must be prepared before the epi-demics. (2) We can only slightly predict what type of in-fluenza will spread in any given season.  This situation naturally demands the early detec-tion of influenza epidemics. This section presents a description of previous methods of influenza epi-demic detection. 2.1 Traditional Approaches Most countries have their own influenza surveil-lance organization/center: the U.S. has the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)2, the E.U. has its European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS), and Japan has its Infection Disease Surveillance Center (IDSC). Their surveillance systems fundamentally rely on both virology and clinical data. For example, the IDSC gathers influ-enza patient data from 5,000 clinics and releases summary reports. Such manual systems typically have a 1–2 week reporting lag. This time lag is sometimes pointed out as a major flaw. 2.2 Recent Approaches In an attempt to provide earlier influenza detection, various new approaches are proposed each year. Espino et al. (2003) described a telephone triage service, a public service, to give advice to users via telephone. They investigated the number of tele-phone calls and reported a significant correlation with influenza epidemics. Magruder (2003) used the amount of over-the-counter drug sales. Because an influenza patient usually requires anti-influenza drugs, this approach is reasonable. However, in most countries, anti-influenza drugs are not available at the drug store (only hospitals provide such drugs). The state-of-the-art approach is that proposed by Ginsberg et al. (2009). They used Google web search queries that correlate with an influenza epi-demic. Their approach demonstrated high accuracy (average correlation ratio of 0.97; min=0.92; max=0.99)3. Several research groups have used similar approaches. Polgreen et al. (2008) used a Yahoo! query log. Hulth et al. (2009) used a query log of a Switzerland web search engine.  Although the above approaches use different in-formation, they share the same approach, which is to observe patient actions directly. This approach was sufficient to obtain more numerous data than traditional services. Nevertheless, such information is unfortunately limited only to the service pro-vider. For example, web search queries are avail-able only for several companies: Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft. This paper examines Twitter data, which are widely available. Note that Paul and Dredze (2011) also propose a similar Twitter based approach. While they focus on a word distribution, this paper                                                            2 http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/ 3 Their service is available at http://www.google.org/flutrends/ (Google Flu Trend).

employs a sentence classification (discrimination of negative influenza tweets). 3 Influenza Corpus As described in Section 1, it is necessary to filter out negative influenza tweets to infer precise amounts of influenza epidemics. To do so, we con-structed the influenza corpus (Section 3). Then, we trained the SVM-based classifier using the corpus (Section 4). The corpus comprises pairs of sentences and a label (positive or negative). Several examples are presented in Table 1. This corpus was built using the following procedure. 3.1 Influenza Tweet  First, we collected 300 million tweets, starting from 2008 November to 2010 June, via Twitter API. Crawling results are presented in Figure 1. We extracted only influenza-related tweets using a simple word look-up of “influenza”. This operation gave us 0.4 million tweets. We separated the data into two data groups. Training Data are 5,000 tweets sent in Novem-ber 2008. These were annotated by human annota-tors, and were then used for training. Test Data are the other data. They were used in experiments of influenza epidemics detection. Be-cause of the three dropout periods (Figure 1), the test data were separated into four periods (winter 2008, summer 2009, winter 2009, and summer 2010). 3.2 Positive–negative Annotation To each tweet in the training dataset, a human an-notator assigned one of two labels: positive or neg-ative. In this labeling procedure, we regarded a tweet that meets the following two conditions as positive data.   Condition 1 (A Tweet person or Surrounding persons have Flu): one or more people who have influenza should exist around the tweet person. Here, we regard “around” as a distance in the same city. In cases in which the distance is unknown, we regard it as negative. Because of this annotation policy, the re-tweet type message is negative.   
 Figure 1: Twitter Data used in this Study. The data include three dropout periods because the Twitter API specifications changed in those periods. The dropout periods were removed from evaluation in the experiments (Section 5).

Condition 2 (Tense/Modality): The tense should be the present tense (current) or recent past. Here, we define the “recent past” as the prior 24 hour period (such as “yesterday”). The sentence should be affirmative (not interrogative and not subjunc-tive). 4 Influenza Positive–negative Classifier Using the corpus (Section 3), we built a classifier that judges whether a given tweet is positive or negative. This task setting is similar to a sentence classification (such as spam e-mail filtering, senti-ment analysis, and so on). We used a popular means for sentence classification, which is based on a machine learning classifier under the bag-of-words (BOW) representation (Figure 2). The parameters were investigated in preliminary ex-periments in terms of feature window size (Section 4.1) and machine-learning methods (Section 4.2). These preliminary experiments were conducted under the ten-fold cross variation manner using the training set. 4.1 Feature (window size) Performance was dependent on the window size (the number of left/right side words). Figure 3 de-picts the performance obtained using various win-dow sizes. The best performance was scored at the BOTH=6 setting. Therefore, this window size was used for the following experiments. These results also indicated that entire sentences (BOTH=?) are unsuitable for this task. 4.2 Machine Learning Method We compared various machine-learning methods from two points of view: accuracy and time. The result, presented in Table 2, shows that SVM with a polynomial kernel showed feasibility from both viewpoints of accuracy and the training time. 5 Experiments We assessed the detection performance using actu-al influenza reports provided by the Japanese IDSC. 5.1 Comparable Methods We compared the various methods as follows:

5.2 Gold Standard and Test-Set For gold standard data, we used data that are de-scribed in Section 2, as reported from IDSC. The report is released once a week. Therefore, the evaluation is done on a weekly basis. We split the data into four seasons as follows: ? Season I: winter 2008, ? Season II: summer 2009, ? Season III: winter 2009, ? Season IV: summer 2010.  To investigate further detailed evaluations, we split the winters into two sub-seasons: before the peak and after the peak. We regard the peak point as the day with the highest number in that season. The statistics derived from the data are presented in Table 3.  Excessive News Period: In our experimental data, Season II and the earlier peak of Season III are special periods because news related to swine flu (H1N1 flu) is extremely hot in those seasons (Fig. 4). This paper calls them Excessive News Periods. We also investigated the results with and without the excessive news period.  
 Figure 4: A CNN news on “swine flu” in June 2009 (Season II in our experiment). Experimental data include such excessive news peri-ods.  5.3 Evaluation Metric The evaluation metric is based on correlation (Pearson correlation) between the gold standard value and the estimated value. 
5.4 Result The results are presented in Table 4. In the non-excessive news period, the proposed method achieved the highest performance (0.890 correla-tion). This correlation is considerably higher than the query-based approach (GOOGLE), demonstrat-ing the basic feasibility of the proposed approach. However, during the excessive news periods, the proposed method suffers from an avalanche of news, generating a news bias. This phenomenon is a remaining problem to be resolved in future stud-ies.  6 Discussion 
6.1 SVM-based Negative Filtering contributes to Performance In most seasons, the proposed SVM approach (TWEET-SVM) shows higher correlation than the simple word lookup method (TWEET-RAW). The average improvement is 0.196 (max 0.56; min-0.009), which significantly boosts the correlation. This result demonstrates the basic feasibility of the proposed approach. In the future, more advantages attributable to the proposed approach can be ob-tained if the classification performance improves. 6.2 All Methods Suffer from News Bias in Excessive News Period All methods expose the poor performance that pre-vails during the excessive news period (from Sea-son II to Season III before the peak). Especially, tweet-based methods show dramatically reduced correlation, which indicates that Twitter is vulner-able to newswire bias. One reason for that vulnerability is that Twitter is a kind of communication tool by which a tweet affects other people. Consequently, the possibility exists that a few tweets related to “flu” might spread widely, generating an explosive burst of influenza-related tweets. Future studies must ad-dress this burst phenomenon.  
1572
  
6.3 Tweets have Advantages in Early Stage Detection From practical viewpoints, the most important task is to detect influenza epidemics before the peak (early stage detection). Consequently, the correla-tion of the two seasons, Season I before the peak and Season III before the peak, presents the practi-cal performance. Figure 5 portrays detailed results of all methods. In Season I before the peak (Figure 5 Left), the proposed method (TWEET-SVM) shows the best performance among all methods. 
In Season II before the peak (Figure 5 Right), all methods including the proposed method showed poor correlation because they are included in the excessive news periods. During that season, the newswires heavily reported the swine flu twice (April 2009 and May 2009). Because of this news, we can see two peaks in Twitter-based methods (TWEET-SVM and TWEET-RAW), which indi-cates that Twitter is more sensitive to the news-wires.

6.4 Human Action is Sensitive before Epi-demics Figure 6 presents the distribution between the de-tected values (using GOOGLE and using TWEET-SVM) and the gold standard value (before the peak is shown by “+”; that after the peak is shown as “-”). Although the detected values fundamentally correlate with the gold standard, we can see differ-ent sensitivity before and after peak (The distribu-tion before peak “+” is a higher value than after peak “-”.).  Results show that human action, a web search (GOOGLE) and a tweet (TWEET-SVM), highly cor-responds to the real influenza before the epidemic peaks, and vice versa. More acute detection is pos-sible if we incorporate a model considering this aspect of human nature. 
7 Related Works The core technology of the proposed method is to classify whether the event is positive or negative. This task is similar to negation identification, which is a traditional topic, especially in medical fields. Therefore, we can find many previous stud-ies of the topic in the relevant literature.

Table 5 presents the difference between both negations. In general, the semantic operation is difficult in general. However, this paper revealed that the domain (influenza domain) specific seman-tic operation provides reasonable results. Another aspect of this study is the target mate-rial, Twitter data, which have drawn much atten-tion. Twitter can provide suitable material for many applications such as named entity recogni-tion (NER) (Finin et al., 2010) and sentiment analysis (Barbosa and Feng, 2010). Although these studies specifically examine the fundamental NLP techniques, this study directly targets an NLP ap-plication that can contribute to our daily life. 8 Conclusion This paper proposed a new Twitter-based influenza epidemics detection method, which relies on the  Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our proposed method could successfully filter out the negative influenza tweets (f-measure=0.76), which are post-ed by the ones who did not actually catch the influ-enza. The experiments with the test data empirically demonstrate that the proposed method detects influenza epidemics with high correlation (correlation ratio=0.89), which outperforms the state-of-the-art Google method. This result shows that Twitter texts precisely reflect the real world, and that the NLP technique can extract the useful information from Twitter streams.
