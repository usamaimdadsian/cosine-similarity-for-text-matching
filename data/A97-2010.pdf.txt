Previous corpus-based Word Sense Disambigua- 
tion (WSD) algorithms (Hearst, 1991; Bruce and 
Wiebe, 1994; Leacock et al., 1996; Ng and Lee, 
1996; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995) determine 
the meanings of polysemous words by exploiting 
their local contexts .  A basic intuition that un- 
derlies those algorithms is the following: 
(1) Two occurrences of the same word have 
identical meanings if they have similar local 
contexts. 
In other words, previous corpus-based WSD algo- 
rithms learn to disambiguate a polysemous word 
from previous usages of the same word. This has 
several undesirable consequences. Firstly, a word 
must occur thousands of times before a good clas- 
sifter can be trained. There are thousands of poly- 
semous words, e.g., 11,562 polysemous nouns in 
WordNet (Miller, 1990). For every polysemous 
word to occur thousands of times each, the corpus 
must contain billions of words. Secondly, learning 
to disambiguate a word from the previous usages of 
the same word means that whatever was learned 
for one word is not used on other words, which 
obviously missed generality in natural languages. 
Thirdly, these algorithms cannot deal with words 
for which classifiers have not been trained, which 
explains why most previous WSD algorithms only 
deal with a dozen of polysemous words. 
We demonstrate a new WSD algorithm that re- 
lies on a different intuition: 
(2) Two different words are likely to have similar 
meanings if they occur in identical ocal 
contexts. 
The local context of a word is defined in our algo- 
rithm as a syntactic dependency relationship that 
the word participates in. To disambiguate a pol- 
ysemous word, we search a local context database 
to retrieve the list of words (called selectors) that 
appeared in the same local context as the polyse- 
mous word in the training corpus. The meaning of 
the polysemous word is determined by maximizing 
its similarity to the selectors. 
For example, consider the sentence: 
(3) The new facility will employ 500 of the 
existing 600 employees 
The word "facility" has 5 possible meanings in 
WordNet 1.5: 
1. installation 
2. proficiency/technique 
3. adeptness 
4. readiness 
5. toilet/bathroom 
Since the word "facility" is the subject of "em- 
ploy" and is modified by "new" in (3), we retrieve 
other words that appeared in the same contexts 
and obtain the following two groups of selectors 
(the log A column shows the likelihood ratios (Dun- 
ning, 1993) of these words in the local contexts): 
• Subjects of "employ" with top-20 highest likeli- 
hood ratios:

Since the similarity between Sense 1 of "facility" 
and the selectors is greater than that of other 
senses, the word "facility" in (3) is tagged "Sense 
The key innovation of our algorithm is that a 
polysemous word is disambiguated with past us- 
ages of other words. Whether or not it appears in 
the training corpus is irrelevant. 
Compared with previous corpus-based algo- 
rithms, our approach offers several advantages: 
• The same knowledge sources are used for all 
words, as opposed to using a separate classifier 
for each individual word. For example, the same 
set of selectors can also be used to disambiguate 
"school" in "the new school employed 100 peo- 
ple". 
• It requires a much smaller training corpus that 
needs not be sense-tagged. 
• It is able to deal with words that are infrequent 
or do not even appear in the training corpus. 
• The same mechanism can also be used to infer 
the semantic ategories of unknown words. 
In the demonstrated system, the local context 
database is constructed with 8,665,362 dependency 
relationships that are extracted from a 25-million- 
word Wall Street Journal corpus. The corpus 
is parsed with a broad-coverage parser, PRINCI- 
PAR, in 126 hours on a SPARC-Ultra 1/140 with 
96MB of memory. The nouns in the input text are 
tagged with their senses in WordNet 1.5. Proper 
nouns that do not contain simple markers (e.g., 
Mr., Inc.) to indicate their categories are treated 
as 3-way ambiguous and are tagged as "group", 
"person", or "location" by the system.
