1. Abstract 
We present an evaluation of domain- 
independent atural anguage tools for use in 
the identification of significant concepts in 
documents. Using qualitative evaluation, we 
compare three shallow processing methods for 
extracting index terms, i.e., terms that can be 
used to model the content of documents. We 
focus on two criteria: quality and coverage. In 
terms of quality alone, our results show that 
technical term (TT) extraction \[Justeson and 
Katz 1995\] receives the highest rating. How- 
ever, in terms of a combined quality and cover- 
age metric, the Head Sorting (HS) method, 
described in \[Wacholder 1998\], outperforms 
both other methods, keyword (KW) and TT. 
2. Introduction 
In this paper, we consider the problem of how 
to evaluate the automatic identification of index 
terms that have been derived without recourse 
to lexicons or to other kinds of domain-specific 
information. By index terms, we mean natural 
language xpressions that constitute a meaning- 
ful representation f a document for humans. 
The premise of this research is that if signifi- 
cant topics coherently represent information in 
a document, hese topics can be used as index 
terms that approximate the content of individ- 
ual documents in large collections of electronic 
documents. 
We compare three shallow processing 
methods for identifying index terms: 
• Keywords (KW) are terms identified by 
counting frequency of stemmed words in a 
document; 
Technical terms (TT) are noun phrases 
(NPs) or subparts of NPs repeated more 
than twice in a document \[Justeson and 
Katz 1995\]; 
Head sorted terms (HS) are identified by 
a method in which simplex noun phrases 
(as defined below) are sorted by head and 
then ranked in decreasing order of fre- 
quency \[Wacholder 1998\]. 
The three methods that we evaluated are do- 
main-independent i  that they use statistical 
and/or linguistic properties that apply to any 
natural anguage document in any field. These 
methods are also corpus-independent, i  that 
the ranking of terms for an individual document 
is not dependent on properties of the corpus. 
2.1 Overview of methods and results 
Subjects were drawn from two groups: 
professionals and students. Professionals in- 
cluded librarians and publishing professionals 
familiar with both manual and automatic text 
indexing. Students included undergraduate and 
graduate students with a variety of academic 
interests. 
To assess terms, we used a standard 
qualitative ranking technique. We presented 
subjects with an article and a list of terms 
identified by one of the three methods. Subjects 
were asked to answer the following general 
question: "Would this term be useful in an 
electronic index for this article?" Terms were 
rated on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicates a
high quality term that should definitely be in- 
cluded in the index and 5 indicates a junk term 
that definitely should not be included. For ex- 
1 This research was partly funded by NSF IRI 97-12069, "Automatic identification ofsignificant topics in do- 
main independent full text documents" and NSF IRI 97-53054, "Computationally tractable methods for docu- 
ment analysis". _'tO~ 
ample, the phrase court-approved affirmative 
action plans received an average rating of 1 
from the professionals, meaning that it was 
ranked as useful for the article; the KW af- 
firmative received an average rating of 3.75, 
meaning that it was less useful; and the KW 
action received an average ranking of 4.5, 
meaning that it was not useful. 
The goal of our research is to determine 
which method, or combination of methods, 
provides the best results. We measure results 
in terms of two criteria: quality and coverage. 
By quality, we mean that evaluators ranked 
terms high on the 1 to 5 scale from highest o 
lowest. By coverage, we mean the thoroughness 
with which the terms cover the significant op- 
ics in the document. Our methodology permits 
us to measure both criteria, as shown in Figure 
4. 
Our results from both the professionals and 
students how that TTs are superior with re- 
spect to quality; however, there are only a 
small number of TTs per document, so they do 
not provide adequate coverage in that they are 
not fully representative of the document as a 
whole. In contrast, KWs provide good cover- 
age but relatively poor quality in that KWs are 
vague, and not well filtered. SNPs, which have 
been sorted using HS and filtered, provide a 
better balance of quality and coverage. 
From our study, we draw the following 
conclusions: 
• The KW approach identifies some useful 
index terms, but they are mixed in with a 
large number of low-ranked terms. 
• The TT approach identifies high quality 
terms, but with low coverage, i.e., rela- 
tively few indexing terms. 
• The HS approach achieves a balance be- 
tween quality and coverage. 
3. Domain-independent metrics for identi- 
fying significant opics 
In order to identify significant opics in 
a document, a significance measure is needed, 
i.e., a method for determining which concepts 
in the document are relatively important for a 
given task. The need to determine the impor- 
tance of a particular concept within a document 
is motivated by a range of applications, in- 
cluding information retrieval \[Salton 1989\], 
303 
automatic determination of authorship 
\[Mosteller and Wallace 1963\], similarity met- 
rics for cross-document clustering \[Hatzivas- 
siloglou et al. 1999\], automatic indexing 
\[Hodges et al. 1996\] and input to summariza- 
tion \[Paice 1990\]. 
For example, one of the earlier appli- 
cations using frequency for identifying signifi- 
cant topics in a document was proposed by 
\[Luhn 1958\] for use in creating automatic ab- 
stracts. For each document, a list of stop- 
listed stems was created, and ranked by fre- 
quency; the most frequent keywords were used 
to identify significant sentences in the original 
document. Luhn's premise was that emphasis, 
as indicated by repetition of words and collo- 
cation is an indicator of significance. Namely, 
"the more often certain words are found in each 
other's company within a sentence, the more 
significance may be attributed to each of these 
words." This basic observation, although re- 
fined extensively by later summarization tech- 
niques (as reviewed in \[Paice 1990\]), relies on 
the capability of identifying significant con- 
cepts. 
The standard IR technique known as 
tf*idf \[Salton 1989\] seeks to identify docu- 
ments relevant o a particular query by relativ- 
izing keyword frequency in a document as 
compared to frequency in a corpus. This 
method can be used to locate at least some im- 
portant concepts in full text. Although it has 
been effective for information retrieval, for 
other applications, such as human-oriented in- 
dexing, this technique is impractical. Ambigu- 
ity of stems (trad might refer to trader or 
tradition) and of isolated words (state might be 
a political entity or a mode of being) means 
that lists of keywords have not usually been 
used to represent the content of a document to 
human beings. Furthermore, humans have a 
difficult time processing stems and parts of 
words out of phrasal context. 
The technical term (TT) method, an- 
other technique for identification of significant 
terms in text that can be used as index terms 
was introduced by \[Justeson and Katz 1995\], 
who developed an algorithm for identifying 
repeated multi-word phrases such as central 
processing unit in the computer domain or 
word sense in the lexical semantic domain. 
This algorithm identifies candidate TTs in a 
corpus by locating NPs consisting of nouns, 
adjectives, and sometimes prepositional 
phrases. TTs are defined as those NPs, or their 
subparts, which occur above some frequency 
threshold in a corpus. However, as \[Boguraev 
and Kennedy 1998\] observe, the TT technique 
may not characterize the full content of docu- 
ments. Indeed, even in a technical document, 
TTs do not provide adequate coverage of the 
NPs in a document that contribute to its con- 
tent, especially since TTs are by definition 
multi-word. A truly domain-general method 
should apply to both technical and non- 
technical documents. The relevant difference 
between technical and non-technical documents 
is that in technical documents, many of the 
topics which are significant to the document as 
a whole may be also TTs. 
\[Wacholder 1998\] proposed the 
method of Head Sorting for identifying signifi- 
cant topics that can be used to represent a
source document. HS also uses a frequency 
measure to provide an approximation of topic 
significance. However, instead of counting fre- 
quency of stems or repetition of word se- 
quences, this method counts frequency of a 
relatively easily identified grammatical e ement, 
heads of simplex noun phrases (SNPs). For 
common NPs (NPs whose head is a common 
noun), an SNP is a maximal NP that includes 
premodifiers uch as determiners and posses- 
sives but not post-nominal constituents such as 
prepositions or relativizers. For example, the 
well-known book is an SNP but the well-known 
book on asteroids includes two SNPs, well- 
known book and asteroids. For proper names, 
an SNP is a name that refers to a single entity. 
For example, Museum of the City of New York, 
the name of an organization, is an SNP even 
though the organizational name incorporates a 
city name. Others, such as \[Church 1988\], 
have discussed a similar concept, sometimes 
called simple or base NPs. 
The HS approach is based on the as- 
sumption that nominal elements can be used to 
convey the gist of a document. SNPs, which 
are semantically and syntactically coherent, 
appear to be at a good level of detail for con- 
tent representation f the document. ' 
304 
SNPs are identified by a system \[Evans 
1998; Evans et al. 2000\] which sequentially 
parses text that has been tagged with part of 
speech using a finite state machine. Next, the 
complete list of SNPs identified in a document 
is sorted by the head of the phrase, which, at 
least for English-language common SNPs, is 
almost always the last word. The intuitive justi- 
fication for sorting SNPs by head is based on 
the fundamental linguistic distinction between 
head and modifier: in general, a head makes a 
greater contribution to the syntax and seman- 
tics of a phrase than does a modifier. This lin- 
guistic insight can be extended to the document 
level. If, as a practical matter, it is necessary to 
rank the contribution to a whole document 
made by the sequence of words constituting an 
NP, the head should be ranked more highly 
than other words in the phrase. This distinction 
is important in linguistic theory; for example, 
\[Jackendoff 1977\] discusses the relationship of 
heads and modifiers in phrase structure. It is 
also important in NLP, where, for example, 
\[Strzalkowski 1997\] and \[Evans and Zhai 
1996\] have used the distinction between heads 
and modifiers to add query terms to informa- 
tion retrieval systems. 
Powerful corpus processing techniques 
have been developed to measure deviance from 
an average occurrence or co-occurrence in the 
corpus. In this paper we chose to evaluate 
methods that depend only on document-internal 
data, independent of corpus, domain or genre. 
We therefore did not use, for example, tf*idf, 
the purely statistical technique that is the used 
by most information retrieval systems, or 
\[Smadja 1993\], a hybrid statistical and sym- 
bolic technique for identifying collocations. 
4. Experimental Method 
To evaluate techniques, we performed a quali- 
tative user evaluation i  which the terms identi- 
fied by each method were compared for 
usefulness as index terms. 
4.1 Subjects 
We performed our study with librari- 
ans, publishing professionals and undergradu- 
ate and graduate students at our university. 29 
subjects participated in the study: 7 librarians 
and publishing professionals and 22 students. 
4.2 Data 
For this experiment, we selected three 
articles from the 1990 Wall Street Journal 
contained in the Tipster collection of docu- 
ments. The articles were about 500 words in 
length. 
To compare methods, each article was 
processed three times: 1) with SMART to 
identify stemmed keywords \[Salton 1989\]; 2) 
with an implementation of the TT algorithm 
based on \[Justeson and Katz 1995\]; and 3) with 
our implementation of the HS method. Output 
for one article is shown in Appendix A. Figure 
1 shows the articles selected, their length in 
words and the number of index terms from 
each method for each article presented to the 
subjects.

Figure 1: Word and term count, by type, per 
article 
The number of TTs is much lower than the 
number of KWs or HSs. This presented us with 
a problem: on the one hand, we were concerned 
about preserving the integrity of the three 
methods, each of which has their own logic, 
and at the same time, we were concerned to 
present lists that were balanced relative to each 
other. Toward this end, we made several deci- 
sions about presentation of the data: 
1. Threshold: So that no bias would be un- 
intentionally introduced, we presented 
subjects with all terms output by each 
method, up to a specified cut-off poin- 
However, using lists of equal length for 
each method would have necessitated ither 
omitting HSs and KWs or changing the 
definition of TTs. Therefore we made the 
following decisions: 
• For TTs, we included all identified 
terms; 
• For HSs, we included all terms whose 
head occurred more than once in the 
document; 
305 
. 
. 
• For KWs, we included all terms in or- 
der of decreasing frequency, up to the 
point where we observed diminishing 
quality and where the number of KWs 
approximated the number of HSs. 
Order: For the KW and TT approach, 
order is not significant. However, for the 
HS approach, the grouping together of 
phrases with common heads is, we claim, 
one of the advantages of the method. We 
therefore alphabetized the KWs and TTs in 
standard left to right order and alphabet- 
ized the HSs by head, e.g., trust account 
precedes money market fund. 
Morphological expansion: The KW ap- 
proach identifies stems which represent a
set of one or more morphological variants 
of the stem. Since in some cases the stem 
is not an English word, we expanded each 
stem to include the morphological variants 
that actually occurred in the article. For 
example, for the stem reject, we listed re- 
jected and rejecting but did not list rejects, 
which did not occur in the article. 
4.3 Presentation to subjects 
Each subject was presented with three articles. 
For one article, the subject received a head 
sorted list of HSs; for another article, the sub- 
ject received a list of technical terms, and for 
the third article, the subject saw a list of key- 
words. No time limit was placed on the task. 
5. Results 
Our results for the three types of terms, by 
document, are shown in Figure 2. Although we 
asked subjects to rate three articles, some vol- 
unteers rated only two. All results were in- 
cluded.

5.1 Quality 
For the three lists of index terms, TTs received 
the highest ratings for all three documents--an 
average of 1.79 on the scale of 1 to 5, with 1 
being the best rating. HS came in second, with 
an average of 2.89, and KW came in last with 
an average of 3.27. It should be noted that av- 
eraging the average conceals the fact that the 
number of TTs is much lower than the other 
two types of terms, as shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 3 (included before Appendix A) 
shows cumulative rankings of terms by method. 
The X axis represents ratings awarded by sub- 
jects. The Y axis reflects the percentage of 
terms receiving a given rank or better. All data 
series must reach 100% since every term has 
been assigned a rating by the evaluators. At 
any given data point, a larger value indicates 
that a larger percentage of that series' data has 
that particular ating or better. For example, 
100% of the TTs have a rating of 3 or better; 
while only about 30% of the terms of the low- 
est-scoring KW document received a score of 3 
or better. In two out of the three documents, 
HS terms fall between TTs and KWs. 
5.2 Coverage 
The graph in Figure 3 shows results 
for quality, not coverage. In contrast, Figure 4, 
which shows the total number of terms rated at 
or below specified rankings, allows us to meas- 
ure quality and coverage. (1 is the highest rat- 
ing; 5 is the lowest.) This figure shows that the 
HS method identifies more high quality terms 
than the TT method oes.

TT clearly identifies the highest quality terms: 
100% of TTs receive a rating of 2 or better. 
However, only 8 TTs received a rating of 2 or 
better (38% of the total), while 41 HSs re- 
306 
ceived a rating of 2 or better (26% of the total). 
This indicates that the TT method misses many 
high quality terms. KW, the least discriminat- 
ing method in terms of quality, also provides 
better coverage than does TT. 
This result is consistent with our observa- 
tion that TT identifies the highest quality terms, 
but there are very few of them: an average of 7 
per 500 words compared to over 50 for HS and 
KW. Therefore there is a need for additional 
high quality terms. The list of HSs received a
higher average rating than did the list of KWs, 
as shown in Figure 2. This is consistent with 
our expectation that phrases containing more 
content-bearing modifiers would be perceived 
as more useful index terms than would single 
word phrases consisting only of heads. 
5.3 Ranking variability 
The difference in the average ratings for 
the list of KWs and the list of head-sorted 
SNPs was less than expected. The small differ- 
ence in average ratings for the HS list and the 
KW list can be explained, at least in part, by 
two factors: 1) Differences among profession- 
als and students in inter-subject agreement and 
reliability; 2) A discrepancy in the rating of 
single word terms across term types. 
22 students and 7 professionals par- 
ticipated in the study. Figure 5 shows differ- 
ences in the ratings of professionals and of 
students.

Figure 5: Average ratings, by term type, of 
professionals and students 
When variation in the scores for terms was cal- 
culated using standard eviation, the standard 
deviation for the professionals was 0.78, while 
for the students it was 1.02. Because of the 
relatively low number of professionals, the 
standard deviation was calculated only over 
terms that were rated by more than one profes- 
sional. A review of the students' results showed 
that they appeared not to be as careful as the 
professionals. For example, the phrase 'Wall 
Street Journal' was included on the HS list only 
because it is specified as the document source. 
However, four of the eight students assigned 
this term a high rating (1 or 2); this is puzzling 
because the document is about asbestos-related 
disease. The other four students assigned a 4 
or 5 to 'Wall Street Journal', as we expected. 
But the average score for this term was 3, due 
to the anomalous ratings. We therefore have 
more confidence in the reliability of the profes- 
sional ratings, even though there are relatively 
few of them. 
We examined some of the differences in 
rating for term types. Single word index terms 
are rated more highly by professionals when 
they appear in the context of other single word 
index terms, but are downrated in the context 
of phrasal expansions that make the meaning of 
the one-word term more specific. The KW list 
and HS list overlap when the SNP consists only 
of a single word (the head) or only of a head 
modified by determiners. When the same word 
appears in both lists in identical form, the token 
in the KW list tends to receive a better ating 
than the token does when it appears in the HS 
list, where it is often followed by expansions of 
the head. For example, the word exposure re- 
ceived an average rating of 2.2 when it ap- 
peared on the KW list, but a rating of only 2.75 
on the HS list. However, the more specific 
phrase racial quotas, which immediately fol- 
lowed quota on the HS list received a rating of 
1. 
To better understand these differences, we 
selected 40 multi-word phrases and examined 
the average score that the phrase received in the 
TT and HS lists, and compared it to the aver- 
age ratings that individual words received in 
the KW list. We found that in about half of the 
cases (21 of 40), the phrase as a whole and the 
individual words in the phrase received similar 
scores, as in Example 1 in Figure 6. In just 
over one-fourth of the cases (12 of 40), the 
phrase scored well, but scores from the indi- 
vidual words were rated from good to poor, as 
in Example 2. In about one-eighth of the cases 
(6 of 40), the phrase scored well, but the indi- 
vidual words scored poorly, as in Example 3. 
Finally, in only one case, shown in Example 4 
of Figure 6, the phrase scored poorly but the 
individual words scored well.

Figure 6: Comparison of scores of phrases

This shows that single words in isolation are 
judged differently than the same word when 
presented in the context of a larger phrase. 
These results have important implications in 
the design of indexing tools. 
6. Conclusion 
Our results show that the head sorting 
technique outperforms two other indexing 
methods, technical terms and keywords, as 
measured by balance of quality and coverage. 
We have performed a qualitative valuation of 
three techniques for identifying significant 
terms in a document, driven by an indexing 
task. Such an applicati;on can be used to create 
a profile or thumbnail of a document by pre- 
senting to users a set of terms which can be 
considered to be a representation f the content 
of the document. We have used human judges 
to evaluate the effectiveness of each method. 
This research is a contribution to the overall 
evaluation of computational linguistic tools in 
terms of their usefulness for human-oriented 
computational applications.
