Abstract
We present a language-pair independent
terminology extraction module that is
based on a sub-sentential alignment sys-
tem that links linguistically motivated
phrases in parallel texts. Statistical filters
are applied on the bilingual list of candi-
date terms that is extracted from the align-
ment output.
We compare the performance of both
the alignment and terminology extrac-
tion module for three different language
pairs (French-English, French-Italian and
French-Dutch) and highlight language-
pair specific problems (e.g. different com-
pounding strategy in French and Dutch).
Comparisons with standard terminology
extraction programs show an improvement
of up to 20% for bilingual terminology ex-
traction and competitive results (85% to
90% accuracy) for monolingual terminol-
ogy extraction, and reveal that the linguis-
tically based alignment module is particu-
larly well suited for the extraction of com-
plex multiword terms.
1 Introduction
Automatic Term Recognition (ATR) systems are
usually categorized into two main families. On the
one hand, the linguistically-based or rule-based
approaches use linguistic information such as PoS
tags, chunk information, etc. to filter out stop
words and restrict candidate terms to predefined
syntactic patterns (Ananiadou, 1994), (Dagan and
Church, 1994). On the other hand, the statistical
corpus-based approaches select n-gram sequences
as candidate terms that are filtered by means of
statistical measures. More recent ATR systems
use hybrid approaches that combine both linguis-
tic and statistical information (Frantzi and Anani-
adou, 1999).
Most bilingual terminology extraction systems
first identify candidate terms in the source lan-
guage based on predefined source patterns, and
then select translation candidates for these terms
in the target language (Kupiec, 1993).
We present an alternative approach that gen-
erates candidate terms directly from the aligned
words and phrases in our parallel corpus. In a sec-
ond step, we use frequency information of a gen-
eral purpose corpus and the n-gram frequencies
of the automotive corpus to determine the term
specificity. Our approach is more flexible in the
sense that we do not first generate candidate terms
based on language-dependent predefined PoS pat-
terns (e.g. for French, N N, N Prep N, and N
Adj are typical patterns), but immediately link lin-
guistically motivated phrases in our parallel cor-
pus based on lexical correspondences and syntac-
tic similarity.
This article reports on the term extraction ex-
periments for 3 language pairs, i.e. French-Dutch,
French-English and French-Italian. The focus was
on the extraction of automative lexicons.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes the corpus. In Section 3
we present our linguistically-based sub-sentential
alignment system and in Section 4 we describe
how we generate and filter our list of candidate
terms. We compare the performance of our sys-
tem with both bilingual and monolingual state-of-
the-art terminology extraction systems. Section 5
concludes this paper.

2 Corpus
The focus of this research project was on the au-
tomatic extraction of 20 bilingual automative lex-
icons. All work was carried out in the framework
of a customer project for a major French automo-
tive company. The final goal of the project is to
improve vocabulary consistency in technical texts
across the 20 languages in the customer’s portfo-
lio. The French database contains about 400,000
entries (i.e. sentences and parts of sentences with
an average length of 9 words) and the translation
percentage of the database into 19 languages de-
pends on the target market.
For the development of the alignment and termi-
nology extraction module, we created three paral-
lel corpora (Italian, English, Dutch) with French
as a central language. Figures about the size of
each parallel corpus can be found in table 1.
Target Lang. # Sentence pairs # words
French Italian 364,221 6,408,693
French English 363,651 7,305,151
French Dutch 364,311 7,100,585
Table 1: Number of sentence pairs and total num-
ber of words in the three parallel corpora
2.1 Preprocessing
We PoS-tagged and lemmatized the French, En-
glish and Italian corpora with the freely available
TreeTagger tool (Schmid, 1994) and we used Tad-
Pole (Van den Bosch et al., 2007) to annotate the
Dutch corpus.
In a next step, chunk information was added
by a rule-based language-independent chunker
(Macken et al., 2008) that contains distituency
rules, which implies that chunk boundaries are
added between two PoS codes that cannot occur
in the same constituent.
2.2 Test and development corpus
As we presume that sentence length has an impact
on the alignment performance, and thus on term
extraction, we created three test sets with vary-
ing sentence lengths. We distinguished short sen-
tences (2-7 words), medium-length sentences (8-
19 words) and long sentences (> 19 words). Each
test corpus contains approximately 9,000 words;
the number of sentence pairs per test set can be
found in table 2. We also created a development
corpus with sentences of varying length to debug
the linguistic processing and the alignment mod-
ule as well as to define the thresholds for the sta-
tistical filtering of the candidate terms (see 4.1).
# Words # Sentence pairs
Short (< 8 words) +- 9,000 823
Medium (8-19 words) +- 9,000 386
Long (> 19 words) +- 9,000 180
Development corpus +-5,000 393

the test and development corpora
3 Sub-sentential alignment module
As the basis for our terminology extraction sys-
tem, we used the sub-sentential alignment sys-
tem of (Macken and Daelemans, 2009) that links
linguistically motivated phrases in parallel texts
based on lexical correspondences and syntactic
similarity. In the first phase of this system, anchor
chunks are linked, i.e. chunks that can be linked
with a very high precision. We think these anchor
chunks offer a valid and language-independent al-
ternative to identify candidate terms based on pre-
defined PoS patterns. As the automotive corpus
contains rather literal translations, we expect that a
high percentage of anchor chunks can be retrieved.
Although the architecture of the sub-sentential
alignment system is language-independent, some
language-specific resources are used. First, a
bilingual lexicon to generate the lexical correspon-
dences and second, tools to generate additional
linguistic information (PoS tagger, lemmatizer and
a chunker). The sub-sentential alignment system
takes as input sentence-aligned texts, together with
the additional linguistic annotations for the source
and the target texts.
The source and target sentences are divided into
chunks based on PoS information, and lexical cor-
respondences are retrieved from a bilingual dic-
tionary. In order to extract bilingual dictionaries
from the three parallel corpora, we used the Perl
implementation of IBM Model One that is part of
the Microsoft Bilingual Sentence Aligner (Moore,
2002).
In order to link chunks based on lexical clues
and chunk similarity, the following steps are taken
for each sentence pair:
1. Creation of the lexical link matrix
2. Linking chunks based on lexical correspon-
dences and chunk similarity
497
3. Linking remaining chunks
3.1 Lexical Link Matrix
For each source and target word, all translations
for the word form and the lemma are retrieved
from the bilingual dictionary. In the process of
building the lexical link matrix, function words are
neglected. For all content words, a lexical link is
created if a source word occurs in the set of pos-
sible translations of a target word, or if a target
word occurs in the set of possible translations of
the source words. Identical strings in source and
target language are also linked.
3.2 Linking Anchor chunks
Candidate anchor chunks are selected based on the
information available in the lexical link matrix.
The candidate target chunk is built by concatenat-
ing all target chunks from a begin index until an
end index. The begin index points to the first target
chunk with a lexical link to the source chunk un-
der consideration. The end index points to the last
target chunk with a lexical link to the source chunk
under consideration. This way, 1:1 and 1:n candi-
date target chunks are built. The process of select-
ing candidate chunks as described above, is per-
formed a second time starting from the target sen-
tence. This way, additional n:1 candidates are con-
structed. For each selected candidate pair, a simi-
larity test is performed. Chunks are considered to
be similar if at least a certain percentage of words
of source and target chunk(s) are either linked by
means of a lexical link or can be linked on the basis
of corresponding part-of-speech codes. The per-
centage of words that have to be linked was em-
pirically set at 85%.
3.3 Linking Remaining Chunks
In a second step, chunks consisting of one function
word – mostly punctuation marks and conjunc-
tions – are linked based on corresponding part-of-
speech codes if their left or right neighbour on the
diagonal is an anchor chunk. Corresponding final
punctuation marks are also linked.
In a final step, additional candidates are con-
structed by selecting non-anchor chunks in the
source and target sentence that have correspond-
ing left and right anchor chunks as neigbours. The
anchor chunks of the first step are used as contex-
tual information to link n:m chunks or chunks for
which no lexical link was found in the lexical link
matrix.
In Figure 1, the chunks [Fr: gradient] – [En:
gradient] and the final punctuation mark have been
retrieved in the first step as anchor chunk. In the
last step, the n:m chunk [Fr: de remonte´e pe´dale
d’ embrayage] – [En: of rising of the clutch pedal]
is selected as candidate anchor chunk because it is
enclosed within anchor chunks.
Figure 1: n:m candidate chunk: ’A’ stands for an-
chor chunks, ’L’ for lexical links, ’P’ for words
linked on the basis of corresponding PoS codes
and ’R’ for words linked by language-dependent
rules.
As the contextual clues (the left and right neig-
bours of the additional candidate chunks are an-
chor chunks) provide some extra indication that
the chunks can be linked, the similarity test for
the final candidates was somewhat relaxed: the
percentage of words that have to be linked was
lowered to 0.80 and a more relaxed PoS matching
function was used.
3.4 Evaluation
To test our alignment module, we manually indi-
cated all translational correspondences in the three
test corpora. We used the evaluation methodology
of Och and Ney (2003) to evaluate the system’s
performance. They distinguished sure alignments
(S) and possible alignments (P) and introduced the
following redefined precision and recall measures
(where A refers to the set of alignments):
precision =
|A ? P |
|A|
, recall =
|A ? S|
|S|
(1)
and the alignment error rate (AER):
AER(S, P ;A) = 1?
|A ? P |+ |A ? S|
|A|+ |S|
(2)
498
Table 3 shows the alignment results for the three
language pairs. (Macken et al., 2008) showed that
the results for French-English were competitive to
state-of-the-art alignment systems.

tem evaluated on French-Italian, French-English
and French-Dutch
As expected, the results show that the align-
ment quality is closely related to the similarity be-
tween languages. As shown in example (1), Ital-
ian and French are syntactically almost identical
– and hence easier to align, English and French
are still close but show some differences (e.g dif-
ferent compounding strategy and word order) and
French and Dutch present a very different lan-
guage structure (e.g. in Dutch the different com-
pound parts are not separated by spaces, separable
verbs, i.e. verbs with prefixes that are stripped off,
occur frequently (losmaken as an infinitive versus
maak los in the conjugated forms) and a different
word order is adopted).

En: unclip the seat belt mounting.
Du: maak de oprolautomaat van de autogordel los.
(En: clip the mounting of the seat-belt un)
We tried to improve the low recall for French-
Dutch by adding a decompounding module to our
alignment system. In case the target word does
not have a lexical correspondence in the source
sentence, we decompose the Dutch word into its
meaningful parts and look for translations of the
compound parts. This implies that, without de-
compounding, in example 2 only the correspon-
dences doublure – binnenpaneel, arc – dakverste-
viging and arrie`re – achter will be found. By de-
composing the compound into its meaningful parts
(binnenpaneel = binnen + paneel, dakversteviging
= dak + versteviging) and retrieving the lexical
links for the compound parts, we were able to link
the missing correspondence: pavillon – dakverste-
viging.
(2) Fr: doublure arc pavillon arrie`re.
(En: rear roof arch lining)
Du: binnenpaneel dakversteviging achter.
We experimented with the decompounding mod-
ule of (Vandeghinste, 2008), which is based on
the Celex lexical database (Baayen et al., 1993).
The module, however, did not adapt well to the
highly technical automotive domain, which is re-
flected by its low recall and the low confidence
values for many technical terms. In order to adapt
the module to the automotive domain, we imple-
mented a domain-dependent extension to the de-
compounding module on the basis of the devel-
opment corpus. This was done by first running the
decompounding module on the Dutch sentences to
construct a list with possible compound heads, be-
ing valid compound parts in Dutch. This list was
updated by inspecting the decompounding results
on the development corpus. While decomposing,
we go from right to left and strip off the longest
valid part that occurs in our preconstructed list
with compound parts and we repeat this process
on the remaining part of the word until we reach
the beginning of the word.
Table 4 shows the impact of the decompound-
ing module, which is more prominent for short
and medium sentences than for long sentences. A
superficial error analysis revealed that long sen-
tences combine a lot of other French – Dutch
alignment difficulties next to the decompounding
problem (e.g. different word order and separable
verbs).

4 Term extraction module
As described in Section 1, we generate candi-
date terms from the aligned phrases. We believe
these anchor chunks offer a more flexible approach
499
because the method is language-pair independent
and is not restricted to a predefined set of PoS pat-
terns to identify valid candidate terms. In a second
step, we use a general-purpose corpus and the n-
gram frequency of the automotive corpus to deter-
mine the specificity of the candidate terms.
The candidate terms are generated in several
steps, as illustrated below for example (3).

3. strip off the adjectives from the anchor
chunks:

4.1 Filtering candidate terms
To filter our candidate terms, we keep following
criteria in mind:
• each entry in the extracted lexicon should re-
fer to an object or action that is relevant for
the domain (notion of termhood that is used
to express “the degree to which a linguis-
tic unit is related to domain-specific context”
(Kageura and Umino, 1996))
• multiword terms should present a high de-
gree of cohesiveness (notion of unithood that
expresses the “degree of strength or stability
of syntagmatic combinations or collocations”
(Kageura and Umino, 1996))
• all term pairs should contain valid translation
pairs (translation quality is also taken into
consideration)
To measure the termhood criterion and to fil-
ter out general vocabulary words, we applied
Log-Likelihood filters on the French single-word
terms. In order to filter on low unithood values,
we calculated the Mutual Expectation Measure for
the multiword terms in both source and target lan-
guage.
4.1.1 Log-Likelihood Measure
The Log-Likehood measure (LL) should allow us
to detect single word terms that are distinctive
enough to be kept in our bilingual lexicon (Daille,
1995). This metric considers word frequencies
weighted over two different corpora (in our case a
technical automotive corpus and the more general
purpose corpus “Le Monde”1), in order to assign
high LL-values to words having much higher or
lower frequencies than expected. We implemented
the formula for both the expected values and the
Log-Likelihood values as described by (Rayson
and Garside, 2000).
Manual inspection of the Log-Likelihood fig-
ures confirmed our hypothesis that more domain-
specific terms in our corpus were assigned high
LL-values. We experimentally defined the thresh-
old for Log-Likelihood values corresponding to
distinctive terms on our development corpus. Ex-
ample (4) shows some translation pairs which are
filtered out by applying the LL threshold.
(4) Fr: cependant – En: however – It: tuttavia – Du:
echter
Fr: choix – En: choice – It: scelta – Du: keuze
Fr: continuer – En: continue – It: continuare – Du:
verdergaan
Fr: cadre – En: frame – It: cornice – Du: frame
(erroneous filtering)
Fr: alle´gement – En: lightening – It: alleggerire –
Du: verlichten (erroneous filtering)
4.1.2 Mutual Expectation Measure
The Mutual Expectation measure as described by
Dias and Kaalep (2003) is used to measure the
degree of cohesiveness between words in a text.
This way, candidate multiword terms whose com-
ponents do not occur together more often than ex-
pected by chance get filtered out. In a first step,
we have calculated all n-gram frequencies (up to
8-grams) for our four automotive corpora and then
used these frequencies to derive the Normalised
1http://catalog.elra.info/product info.php?products id=438
500
Expectation (NE) values for all multiword entries,
as specified by the formula of Dias and Kaalep:
NE =
prob(n? gram)
1
n
?
prob(n? 1? grams)
(3)
The Normalised Expectation value expresses the
cost, in terms of cohesiveness, of the possible loss
of one word in an n-gram. The higher the fre-
quency of the n-1-grams, the smaller the NE, and
the smaller the chance that it is a valid multiword
expression. The final Mutual Expectation (ME)
value is then obtained by multiplying the NE val-
ues by the n-gram frequency. This way, the Mu-
tual Expectation between n words in a multiword
expression is based on the Normalised Expecta-
tion and the relative frequency of the n-gram in
the corpus.
We calculated Mutual Expectation values for all
candidate multiword term pairs and filtered out in-
complete or erroneous terms having ME values be-
low an experimentally set threshold (being below
0.005 for both source and target multiword or be-
low 0.0002 for one of the two multiwords in the
translation pair). The following incomplete can-
didate terms in example (5) were filtered out by
applying the ME filter:
(5) Fr: fermeture embout - En: end closing - It:
chiusura terminale - Du: afsluiting deel
(should be: Fr: fermeture embout de brancard - En:
chassis member end closing panel - It: chiusura ter-
minale del longherone - Du: afsluiting voorste deel
van langsbalk)
4.2 Evaluation
The terminology extraction module was tested on
all sentences from the three test corpora. The out-
put was manually labeled and the annotators were
asked to judge both the translational quality of the
entry (both languages should refer to the same ref-
erential unit) as well as the relevance of the term
in an automotive context. Three labels were used:
OK (valid entry), NOK (not a valid entry) and
MAYBE (in case the annotator was not sure about
the relevance of the term).
First, the impact of the statistical filtering was
measured on the bilingual term extraction. Sec-
ondly, we compared the output of our system with
the output of a commercial bilingual terminology
extraction module and with the output of a set of
standard monolingual term extraction modules.
Since the annotators labeled system output, the
reported scores all refer to precision scores. In fu-
ture work, we will develop a gold standard corpus
which will enable us to also calculate recall scores.
4.2.1 Impact of filtering
Table 5 shows the difference in performance for
both single and multiword terms with and with-
out filtering. Single-word filtering seems to have a
bigger impact on the results than multiword filter-
ing. This can be explained by the fact that our can-
didate multiword terms are generated from anchor
chunks (chunks aligned with a very high preci-
sion) that already answer to strict syntactical con-
straints. The annotators also mentioned the diffi-
culty of judging the relevance of single word terms
for the automotive domain (no clear distinction be-
tween technical and common vocabulary).

4.2.2 Comparison with bilingual terminology
extraction
We compared the three filtered bilingual lexi-
cons (French versus English-Italian-Dutch) with
the output of a commercial state-of-the-art termi-
nology extraction program SDL MultiTerm Ex-
tract2. MultiTerm is a statistically based system
that first generates a list of candidate terms in the
source language (French in our case) and then
looks for translations of these terms in the target
language. We ran MultiTerm with its default set-
tings (default noise-silence threshold, default stop-
word list, etc.) on a large portion of our parallel
corpus that also contains all test sentences3. We
ran our system (where term extraction happens on
a sentence per sentence basis) on the three test
sets.
2www.translationzone.com/en/products/sdlmultitermextract
370,000 sentences seemed to be the maximum size of
the corpus that could be easily processed within MultiTerm
Extract.
501
Table 6 shows that even after applying statistical
filters, our term extraction module retains a much
higher number of candidate terms than MultiTerm.

Table 6: Number of terms before and after apply-
ing Log-Likelihood and ME filters
Table 7 lists the results of both systems and
shows the differences in performance for single
and multiword terms. Following observations can
be made:
• The performance of both systems is compa-
rable for the extraction of single word terms,
but our system clearly outperforms Multi-
Term when it comes to the extraction of more
complex multiword terms.
• Although the alignment results for French-
Italian were very good, we do not achieve
comparable results for Italian multiword ex-
traction. This can be due to the fact that the
syntactic structure is very similar in both lan-
guages. As a result, smaller syntactic chunks
are linked. However one can argue that, just
because of the syntactic resemblance of both
languages, the need for complex multiword
terms is less prominent in closely related lan-
guages as translators can just paste smaller
noun phrases together in the same order in
both languages. If we take the following ex-
ample for instance:
de´poser – l’ embout – de brancard
togliere – il terminale – del sotto-
porta
we can recompose the larger compound
l’embout de brancard or il terminale del sot-
toporta by translating the smaller parts in the
same order (l’embout – il terminale and de
brancard – del sottoporta
• Despite the worse alignment results for
Dutch, we achieve good accuracy results on
the multiword term extraction. Part of that
can be explained by the fact that French and
Dutch use a different compounding strategy:
whereas French compounds are created by
concatenating prepositional phrases, Dutch
usually tends to concatenate noun phrases
(even without inserting spaces between the
different compound parts). This way we can
extract larger Dutch chunks that correspond
to several French chunks, for instance:
Fr: feu re´gulateur – de pression
carburant.
Du: brandstofdrukregelaar.

4.2.3 Comparison with monolingual
terminology extraction
In order to have insights in the performance of
our terminology extraction module, without con-
sidering the validity of the bilingual terminology
pairs, we contrasted our extracted English terms
with state-of-the art monolingual terminology sys-
tems. As we want to include both single words and
multiword terms in our technical automotive lex-
icon, we only considered ATR systems which ex-
tract both categories. We used the implementation
for these systems from (Zhang et al., 2008) which
is freely available at1.
We compared our system against 5 other ATR
systems:
1. Baseline system (Simple Term Frequency)
2. Weirdness algorithm (Ahmad et al., 2007)
which compares term frequencies in the tar-
get and reference corpora
3. C-value (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 1999)
which uses term frequencies as well as
unit-hood filters (to measure the collocation
strength of units)

4. Glossex (Kozakov et al., 2004) which uses
term frequency information from both the tar-
get and reference corpora and compares term
frequencies with frequencies of the multi-
word components
5. TermExtractor (Sclano and Velardi, 2007)
which is comparable to Glossex but intro-
duces the ”domain consensus” which ”sim-
ulates the consensus that a term must gain in
a community before being considered a rele-
vant domain term”
For all of the above algorithms, the input auto-
motive corpus is PoS tagged and linguistic filters
(selecting nouns and noun phrases) are applied to
extract candidate terms. In a second step, stop-
words are removed and the same set of extracted
candidate terms (1105 single words and 1341 mul-
tiwords) is ranked differently by each algorithm.
To compare the performance of the ranking algo-
rithms, we selected the top terms (300 single and
multiword terms) produced by all algorithms and
compared these with our top candidate terms that
are ranked by descending Log-likelihood (calcu-
lated on the BNC corpus) and Mutual Expectation
values. Our filtered list of unique English automo-
tive terms contains 1279 single words and 1879
multiwords in total. About 10% of the terms do
not overlap between the two term lists. All can-
didate terms have been manually labeled by lin-
guists. Table 8 shows the results of this compari-
son.

Table 8: Results for monolingual Term Extraction
on the English part of the automotive corpus
Although our term extraction module has been tai-
lored towards bilingual term extraction, the results
look competitive to monolingual state-of-the-art
ATR systems. If we compare these results with
our bilingual term extraction results, we can ob-
serve that we gain more in performance for mul-
tiwords than for single words, which might mean
that the filtering and ranking based on the Mutual
Expectation works better than the Log-Likelihood
ranking.
An error analysis of the results leads to the fol-
lowing insights:
• All systems suffer from partial retrieval of
complex multiwords (e.g. ATR management
ecu instead of engine management ecu, AC
approach chassis leg end piece closure in-
stead of chassis leg end piece closure panel).
• We manage to extract nice sets of multiwords
that can be associated with a given concept,
which could be nice for automatic ontology
population (e.g. AC approach gearbox cas-
ing, gearbox casing earth, gearbox casing
earth cable, gearbox control, gearbox control
cables, gearbox cover, gearbox ecu, gearbox
ecu initialisation procedure, gearbox fixing,
gearbox lower fixings, gearbox oil, gearbox
oil cooler protective plug).
• Sometimes smaller compounds are not ex-
tracted because they belong to the same syn-
tactic chunk (E.g we extract passenger com-
partment assembly, passenger compartment
safety, passenger compartment side panel,
etc. but not passenger compartment as such).
5 Conclusions and further work
We presented a bilingual terminology extraction
module that starts from sub-sentential alignments
in parallel corpora and applied it on three differ-
ent parallel corpora that are part of the same auto-
motive corpus. Comparisons with standard termi-
nology extraction programs show an improvement
of up to 20% for bilingual terminology extraction
and competitive results (85% to 90% accuracy) for
monolingual terminology extraction. In the near
future we want to experiment with other filtering
techniques, especially to measure the domain dis-
tinctiveness of terms and work on a gold standard
for measuring recall next to accuracy. We will
also investigate our approach on languages which
are more distant from each other (e.g. French –
Swedish).
