Abstract
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approxi-
mates the posterior distribution of latent vari-
able models by generating many samples and
averaging over them. In practice, however, it
is often more convenient to cut corners, using
only a single sample or following a suboptimal
averaging strategy. We systematically study dif-
ferent strategies for averaging MCMC samples
and show empirically that averaging properly
leads to significant improvements in prediction.
1 Introduction
Probabilistic topic models are powerful methods to un-
cover hidden thematic structures in text by projecting
each document into a low dimensional space spanned
by a set of topics, each of which is a distribution over
words. Topic models such as latent Dirichlet alloca-
tion (Blei et al., 2003, LDA) and its extensions discover
these topics from text, which allows for effective ex-
ploration, analysis, and summarization of the otherwise
unstructured corpora (Blei, 2012; Blei, 2014).
In addition to exploratory data analysis, a typical goal
of topic models is prediction. Given a set of unanno-
tated training data, unsupervised topic models try to
learn good topics that can generalize to unseen text.
Supervised topic models jointly capture both the text
and associated metadata such as a continuous response
variable (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007; Zhu et al., 2009;
Nguyen et al., 2013), single label (Rosen-Zvi et al.,
2004; Lacoste-Julien et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009)
or multiple labels (Ramage et al., 2009; Ramage et al.,
2011) to predict metadata from text.
Probabilistic topic modeling requires estimating the
posterior distribution. Exact computation of the poste-
rior is often intractable, which motivates approximate
inference techniques (Asuncion et al., 2009). One popu-
lar approach is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a
class of inference algorithms to approximate the target
posterior distribution. To make prediction, MCMC al-
gorithms generate samples on training data to estimate
corpus-level latent variables, and use them to generate
samples to estimate document-level latent variables for
test data. The underlying theory requires averaging on
both training and test samples, but in practice it is often
convenient to cut corners: either skip averaging entirely
by using just the values of the last sample or use a single
training sample and average over test samples.
We systematically study non-averaging and averaging
strategies when performing predictions using MCMC in
topic modeling (Section 2). Using popular unsupervised
(LDA in Section 3) and supervised (SLDA in Section 4)
topic models via thorough experimentation, we show
empirically that cutting corners on averaging leads to
consistently poorer prediction.
2 Learning and Predicting with MCMC
While reviewing all of MCMC is beyond the scope of
this paper, we need to briefly review key concepts.
1
To
estimate a target density p(x) in a high-dimensional
space X , MCMC generates samples {x
t
}
T
t=1
while ex-
ploring X using the Markov assumption. Under this
assumption, sample x
t+1
depends on sample x
t
only,
forming a Markov chain, which allows the sampler to
spend more time in the most important regions of the
density. Two concepts control sample collection:
Burn-in B: Depending on the initial value of the
Markov chain, MCMC algorithms take time to reach
the target distribution. Thus, in practice, samples before
a burn-in period B are often discarded.
Sample-lag L: Averaging over samples to estimate
the target distribution requires i.i.d. samples. However,
future samples depend on the current samples (i.e., the
Markov assumption). To avoid autocorrelation, we dis-
card all but every L samples.
2.1 MCMC in Topic Modeling
As generative probabilistic models, topic models define
a joint distribution over latent variables and observable
evidence. In our setting, the latent variables consist of
corpus-level global variables g and document-level lo-
cal variables l; while the evidence consists of words w
and additional metadata y—the latter omitted in unsu-
pervised models.
During training, MCMC estimates the posterior
p(g, l

chain of T

samples.

Each training sample i pro-
vides a set of fully realized global latent variables
ˆ
g(i),
which can generate test data. During test time, given a

We omit hyperparameters for clarity. We split data into
training (TR) and testing (TE) folds, and denote the training
iteration i and the testing iteration j within the corresponding
Markov chains.

Figure 1 shows an overview. To reduce the ef-
fects of unconverged and autocorrelated samples, dur-
ing training we use a burn-in period of B
TR
and a
sample-lag of L
TR
iterations. We use T
TR
= {i | i ?
(B
TR
, T
TR
] ? (i ? B
TR
) mod L
TR
= 0} to denote the
set of indices of the selected models. Similarly, B
TE
and L
TE
are the test burn-in and sample-lag. The
set of indices of selected samples in test chains is
T
TE
= {j | j ? (B
TE
, T
TE
] ? (j ?B
TE
) mod L
TE
= 0}.
2.2 Averaging Strategies
We use S(i, j) to denote the prediction obtained from
sample j of the test chain i. We now discuss different
strategies to obtain the final prediction:
• Single Final (SF) uses the last sample of last test
chain to obtain the predicted value,
S
SF
= S(T
TR
, T
TE
). (1)
• Single Average (SA) averages over multiple sam-
ples in the last test chain
S
SA
=
1
|T
TE
|
?
j?T
TE
S(T
TR
, j). (2)
This is a common averaging strategy in which we
obtain a point estimate of the global latent variables
at the end of the training chain. Then, a single test
chain is generated on the test data and multiple sam-
ples of this test chain are averaged to obtain the final
prediction (Chang, 2012; Singh et al., 2012; Jiang et
al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014).
• Multiple Final (MF) averages over the last sam-
ples of multiple test chains from multiple models

3 Unsupervised Topic Models
We evaluate the predictive performance of the unsu-
pervised topic model LDA using different averaging
strategies in Section 2.
LDA: Proposed by Blei et al. in 2003, LDA posits that
each document d is a multinomial distribution ?
d
over
K topics, each of which is a multinomial distribution
?
k
over the vocabulary. LDA’s generative process is:
1. For each topic k ? [1,K]
(a) Draw word distribution ?
k
? Dir(?)
2. For each document d ? [1, D]
(a) Draw topic distribution ?
d
? Dir(?)
(b) For each word n ? [1, N
d
]
i. Draw topic z
d,n
? Mult(?
d
)
ii. Draw word w
d,n
? Mult(?
z
d,n
)
In LDA, the global latent variables are topics {?
k
}
K
k=1
and the local latent variables for each document d are
topic proportions ?
d
.
Train: During training, we use collapsed Gibbs sam-
pling to assign each token in the training data with a
topic (Steyvers and Griffiths, 2006). The probability of
1753
assigning token n of training document d to topic k is
p(z

is the number of tokens in the training
document d assigned to topic k, and N
TR,k,v
is the num-
ber of times word type v assigned to topic k. Marginal
counts are denoted by ·, and
?d,n
denotes the count
excluding the assignment of token n in document d.
At each training iteration i, we estimate the distribu-
tion over words

training iteration i.
Test: Because we lack explicit topic annotations for
these data (c.f. Nguyen et al. (2012)), we use perplexity–
a widely-used metric to measure the predictive power
of topic models on held-old documents. To compute
perplexity, we follow the estimating ? method (Wal-
lach et al., 2009, Section 5.1) and evenly split each test
document d into w
TE

d
and w
TE

d
. We first run Gibbs
sampling on w

The three datasets are:

• RESTAURANT: 25,459 reviews of restaurants from
Yelp (Jo and Oh, 2011).
• MOVIE: 5,006 reviews of movies from Rotten
Tomatoes (Pang and Lee, 2005)
We report cross-validated average performance over
five folds, and use K = 50 topics for all datasets. To
update the hyperparameters, we use slice sampling (Wal-
lach, 2008, p. 62).

Results: Figure 2 shows the perplexity of the four
averaging methods, computed with different number
of training iterations T
TR
. SA outperforms SF, showing
the benefits of averaging over multiple test samples
from a single test chain. However, both multiple chain
methods (MF and MA) significantly outperform these
two methods.
This result is consistent with Asuncion et al. (2009),
who run multiple training chains but a single test chain
for each training chain and average over them. This
is more costly since training chains are usually signif-
icantly longer than test chains. In addition, multiple
training chains are sensitive to their initialization.

To find bigrams, we begin with bigram candidates that
occur at least 10 times in the corpus and use a ?

out those having a ?

value less than 5. We then treat selected
bigrams as single word types and add them to the vocabulary.

4 Supervised Topic Models
We evaluate the performance of different prediction
methods using supervised latent Dirichlet allocation
(SLDA) (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) for sentiment anal-
ysis: predicting review ratings given review text. Each
review text is the document w
d
and the metadata y
d
is
the associated rating.
SLDA: Going beyond LDA, SLDA captures the rela-
tionship between latent topics and metadata by mod-
eling each document’s continuous response variable
using a normal linear model, whose covariates are
the document’s empirical distribution of topics: y
d
?
N (?
T
¯
z
d
, ?) where ? is the regression parameter vec-
tor and
¯
z
d
is the empirical distribution over topics of
document d. The generative process of SLDA is:
1. For each topic k ? [1,K]
(a) Draw word distribution ?

(b) Draw parameter ?

2. For each document d ? [1, D]

In SLDA, in addition to the K multinomials {?

K

the global latent variables also contain the regression
parameter ?

Train: For posterior inference during training, follow-
ing Boyd-Graber and Resnik (2010), we use stochastic
EM, which alternates between (1) a Gibbs sampling
step to assign a topic to each token, and (2) optimizing
the regression parameters. The probability of assigning
topic k to token n in the training document d is

compared with two baselines MLR and SVR. Methods using multiple test chains (MF and MA) perform as well as or
better than the two baselines, whereas methods using a single test chain (SF and SA) perform significantly worse.
Experimental setup: We use the same data as in Sec-
tion 3. For all datasets, the metadata are the review
rating, ranging from 1 to 5 stars, which is standard-
ized using z-normalization. We use two evaluation
metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and predictive R-
squared (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007).
For comparison, we consider two baselines: (1) multi-
ple linear regression (MLR), which models the metadata
as a linear function of the features, and (2) support vec-
tor regression (Joachims, 1999, SVR). Both baselines
use the normalized frequencies of unigrams and bigrams
as features. As in the unsupervised case, we report av-
erage performance over five cross-validated folds. For
all models, we use a development set to tune their pa-
rameter(s) and use the set of parameters that gives best
results on the development data at test.

Results: Figure 3 shows SLDA prediction results with
different averaging strategies, computed at different
training iterations.

Consistent with the unsupervised
results in Section 3, SA outperforms SF, but both are
outperformed significantly by the two methods using
multiple test chains (MF and MA).
We also compare the performance of the four pre-
diction methods obtained at the final iteration T
TR
of
the training chain with the two baselines. The results in
Figure 4 show that the two baselines (MLR and SVR) out-
perform significantly the SLDA using only a single test

off between the likelihood of words and response variable.

5 Discussion and Conclusion
MCMC relies on averaging multiple samples to approxi-
mate target densities. When used for prediction, MCMC
needs to generate and average over both training sam-
ples to learn from training data and test samples to make
prediction. We have shown that simple averaging—not
more aggressive, ad hoc approximations like taking the
final sample (either training or test)—is not just a ques-
tion of theoretical aesthetics, but an important factor in
obtaining good prediction performance.
Compared with SVR and MLR baselines, SLDA using
multiple test chains (MF and MA) performs as well as
or better, while SLDA using a single test chain (SF and
SA) falters. This simple experimental setup choice can
determine whether a model improves over reasonable
baselines. In addition, better prediction with shorter
training is possible with multiple test chains. Thus, we
conclude that averaging using multiple chains produces
above-average results.

This gap is because SLDA has not converged after 1,000
training iterations (Figure 3).
