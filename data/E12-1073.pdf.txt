Abstract
The task of paraphrase acquisition from re-
lated sentences can be tackled by a variety
of techniques making use of various types
of knowledge. In this work, we make the
hypothesis that their performance can be
increased if candidate paraphrases can be
validated using information that character-
izes paraphrases independently of the set of
techniques that proposed them. We imple-
ment this as a bi-class classification prob-
lem (i.e. paraphrase vs. not paraphrase),
allowing any paraphrase acquisition tech-
nique to be easily integrated into the com-
bination system. We report experiments on
two languages, English and French, with
5 individual techniques on parallel mono-
lingual parallel corpora obtained via multi-
ple translation, and a large set of classifi-
cation features including surface to contex-
tual similarity measures. Relative improve-
ments in F-measure close to 18% are ob-
tained on both languages over the best per-
forming techniques.
1 Introduction
The fact that natural language allows messages
to be conveyed in a great variety of ways consti-
tutes an important difficulty for NLP, with appli-
cations in both text analysis and generation. The
term paraphrase is now commonly used in the
NLP litterature to refer to textual units of equiva-
lent meaning at the phrasal level (including single
words). For instance, the phrases six months and
half a year form a paraphrase pair applicable in
many different contexts, as they would appropri-
ately denote the same concept. Although one can
envisage to manually build high-coverage lists of
synonyms, enumerating meaning equivalences at
the level of phrases is too daunting a task for hu-
mans. Because this type of knowledge can how-
ever greatly benefit many NLP applications, au-
tomatic acquisition of such paraphrases has at-
tracted a lot of attention (Androutsopoulos and
Malakasiotis, 2010; Madnani and Dorr, 2010),
and significant research efforts have been devoted
to this objective (Callison-Burch, 2007; Bhagat,
2009; Madnani, 2010).
Central to acquiring paraphrases is the need of
assessing the quality of the candidate paraphrases
produced by a given technique. Most works to
date have resorted to human evaluation of para-
phrases on the levels of grammaticality and mean-
ing equivalence. Human evaluation is however
often criticized as being both costly and non re-
producible, and the situation is even more compli-
cated by the inherent complexity of the task that
can produce low inter-judge agreement. Task-
based evaluation involving the use of paraphras-
ing into some application thus seem an acceptable
solution, provided the evaluation methodologies
for the given task are deemed acceptable. This,
in turn, puts the emphasis on observing the im-
pact of paraphrasing on the targeted application
and is rarely accompanied by a study of the intrin-
sic limitations of the paraphrase acquisition tech-
nique used.
The present work is concerned with the task of
sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition from pairs
of related sentences. A large variety of tech-
niques have been proposed that can be applied
to this task. They typically make use of differ-
ent kinds of automatically or manually acquired
knowledge. We make the hypothesis that their
performance can be increased if candidate para-
716
phrases can be validated using information that
characterize paraphrases in complement to the set
of techniques that proposed them. We propose to
implement this as a bi-class classification problem
(i.e. paraphrase vs. not paraphrase), allowing
any paraphrase acquisition technique to be easily
integrated into the combination system. In this
article, we report experiments on two languages,
English and French, with 5 individual techniques
based on a) statistical word alignment models,
b) translational equivalence, c) handcoded rules of
term variation, d) syntactic similarity, and e) edit
distance on word sequences. We used parallel
monolingual parallel corpora obtained via mul-
tiple translation from a single language as our
sources of related sentences, and a large set of
features including surface to contextual similarity
measures. Relative improvements in F-measure
close to 18% are obtained on both languages over
the best performing techniques.
The remainder of this article is organized as
follows. We first briefly review previous work
on sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition in sec-
tion 2. We then describe our experimental setting
in section 3 and the individual techniques that we
have studied in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to
our approach for validating paraphrases proposed
by individual techniques. Finally, section 6 con-
cludes the article and presents some of our future
work in the area of paraphrase acquisition.
2 Related work
The hypothesis that if two words or, by exten-
sion, two phrases, occur in similar contexts then
they may be interchangeable has been extensively
tested. The distributional hypothesis, attributed to
Zellig Harris, was for example applied to syntac-
tic dependency paths in the work of Lin and Pan-
tel (2001). Their results take the form of equiva-
lence patterns with two arguments such as {X asks
for Y, X requests Y, X’s request for Y, X wants Y,
Y is requested by X, . . .}.
Using comparable corpora, where the same in-
formation probably exists under various linguis-
tic forms, increases the likelihood of finding very
close contexts for sub-sentential units. Barzilay
and Lee (2003) proposed a multi-sequence align-
ment algorithm that takes structurally similar sen-
tences and builds a compact lattice representation
that encodes local variations. The work by Bhagat
and Ravichandran (2008) describes an application
of a similar technique on a very large scale.
The hypothesis that two words or phrases are
interchangeable if they share a common trans-
lation into one or more other languages has
also been extensively studied in works on sub-
sentential paraphrase acquisition. Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005) described a pivoting ap-
proach that can exploit bilingual parallel corpora
in several languages. The same technique has
been applied to the acquisition of local paraphras-
ing patterns in Zhao et al. (2008). The work of
Callison-Burch (2008) has shown how the mono-
lingual context of a sentence to paraphrase can be
used to improve the quality of the acquired para-
phrases.
Another approach consists in modelling local
paraphrasing identification rules. The work of
Jacquemin (1999) on the identification of term
variants, which exploits rewriting morphosyntac-
tic rules and descriptions of morphological and
semantic lexical families, can be extended to ex-
tract the various forms corresponding to input pat-
terns from large monolingual corpora.
When parallel monolingual corpora aligned at
the sentence level are available (e.g. multiple
translations into the same language), the task of
sub-sentential paraphrase acquisition can be cast
as one of word alignment between two aligned
sentences (Cohn et al., 2008). Barzilay and
McKeown (2001) applied the distributionality hy-
pothesis on such parallel sentences, and Pang et
al. (2003) proposed an algorithm to align sen-
tences by recursive fusion of their common syn-
tactic constituants.
Finally, they has been a recent interest in auto-
matic evaluation of paraphrases (Callison-Burch
et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2010; Chen and Dolan,
2011; Metzler et al., 2011).
3 Experimental setting
We used the main aspects of the methodology
described by Cohn et al. (2008) for constructing
evaluation corpora and assessing the performance
of techniques on the task of sub-sentential para-
phrase acquisition. Pairs of related sentences are
hand-aligned to define a set of reference atomic
paraphrase pairs at the level of words or phrases,
denoted asRatom1.

“Sure” and “Possible” alignments, and when reusing anno-

ferent types of corpora of related sentences:

lation of the same sentences (e.g. (Barzilay
and McKeown, 2001)).
2. multiple language translation Same as

5. comparable news headlines News head-
lines collected from Google News clusters
(e.g. (Dolan et al., 2004)).
We collected 100 sentence pairs of each type
in French, for which various comparability mea-
sures are reported on Table 1. In particular, the
“% aligned tokens” row indicates the propor-
tion of tokens from the sentence pairs that could
be manually aligned by a native-speaker annota-
tor.2 Obviously, the more common tokens two
sentences from a pair contain, the fewer sub-
sentential paraphrases may be extracted from that
pair. However, high lexical overlap increases the
probability that two sentences be indeed para-
phrases, and in turn the probability that some of
their phrases be paraphrases. Furthermore, the
tated corpora using them we considered all alignments as be-
ing correct.

presence of common token may serve as useful
clues to guide paraphrase extraction.
For our experiments, we chose to use parallel
monolingual corpora obtained by single language
translation, the most direct resource type for ac-
quiring sub-sentential paraphrase pairs. This al-
lows us to define acceptable references for the
task and resort to the most consensual evaluation
technique for paraphrase acquisition to date. Us-
ing such corpora, we expect to be able to extract
precise paraphrases (see Table 1), which will be
natural candidates for further validation, which
will be addressed in section 5.3.
Figure 1 illustrates a reference alignment ob-
tained on a pair of English sentential paraphrases
and the list of atomic paraphrase pairs that can be
extracted from it, against which acquisition tech-
niques will be evaluated. Note that we do not con-
sider pairs of identical units during evaluation, so
we filter them out from the list of reference para-
phrase pairs.
The example in Figure 1 shows different cases
that point to the inherent complexity of this task,
even for human annotators: it could be argued,
for instance, that a correct atomic paraphrase
pair should be reached ? amounted to rather
than reached ? amounted. Also, aligning in-
dependently 260 ? 0.26 and million ? billion
is assuredly an error, while the pair 260 mil-
lion? 0.26 billion would have been appropriate.
A case of alignment that seems non trivial can be
observed in the provided example (during the en-
tire year ? annual). The abovementioned rea-
sons will explain in part the difficulties in reach-
ing high performance values using such gold stan-
dards.

Evaluated techniques have to output atomic can-
didate paraphrase pairs (denoted as Hatom) from
which composite paraphrase pairs (denoted as
H) are computed. The usual measures of pre-
cision (P ), recall (R) and F-measure (F1) can
then be defined in the following way (Cohn et al.,

We conducted experiments using two different
corpora in English and French. In each case,
a held-out development corpus of 150 sentential
paraphrase pairs was used for development and
tuning, and all techniques were evaluated on the
same test set consisting of 375 sentential para-
phrase pairs. For English, we used the MTC

corpus described in (Cohn et al., 2008), consist-
ing of multiply-translated Chinese sentences into
English, and used as our gold standard both the
alignments marked as “Sure” and “Possible”. For
French, we used the CESTA corpus of news ar-
ticles4 obtained by translating into French from
English.
We used the YAWAT (Germann, 2008) manual
alignment tool. Inter-annotator agreement val-
ues (averaging with each annotation set as the
gold standard) are 66.1 for English and 64.6 for
French, which we interpret as acceptable val-
ues. Manual inspection of the two corpora reveals
that the French corpus tends to contain more lit-
eral translations, possibly due to the original lan-
guages of the sentences, which are closer to the
target language than Chinese is to English.
4 Individual techniques for paraphrase
acquisition
As discussed in section 2, the acquisition of sub-
sentential paraphrases is a challenging task that
has previously attracted a lot of work. In this
work, we consider the scenario where sentential
paraphrases are available and words and phrases
from one sentence can be aligned to words and
phrases from the other sentence to form atomic
paraphrase pairs. We now describe several tech-
niques that perform the task of sub-sentential unit
alignment. We have selected and implemented
five techniques which we believe are representa-
tive of the type of knowledge that these techniques
use, and have reused existing tools, initially devel-
oped for other tasks, when possible.
4.1 Statistical learning of word alignments
(Giza)
The GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2004) computes
statistical word alignment models of increasing
complexity from parallel corpora. While origi-
nally developed in the bilingual context of Statis-
tical Machine Translation, nothing prevents build-
ing such models on monolingual corpora. How-
ever, in order to build reliable models, it is nec-
essary to use enough training material includ-
ing minimal redundancy of words. To this end,
we provided GIZA++ with all possible sentence
pairs from our mutiply-translated corpus to im-
prove the quality of its word alignments (note that
4http://www.elda.org/article125.html
719
we used symmetrized alignments from the align-
ments in both directions). This constitutes a sig-
nificant advantage for this technique that tech-
niques working on each sentence pair indepen-
dently do not have.
4.2 Translational equivalence (Pivot)
Translational equivalence can be exploited to de-
termine that two phrases may be paraphrases.
Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005) defined a
paraphrasing probability between two phrases
based on their translation probability through all
possible pivot phrases as:
Ppara(p1, p2) =
?
piv
Pt(piv|p1)Pt(p2|piv)
where Pt denotes translation probabilies. We used
the Europarl corpus5 of parliamentary debates in
English and French, consisting of approximately
1.7 million parallel sentences : this allowed us
to use the same resource to build paraphrases for
English, using French as the pivot language, and
for French, using English as the pivot language.
The GIZA++ tool was used for word alignment
and the MOSES Statistical Machine Translation
toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) was used to com-
pute phrase translation probabilities from these
word alignments. For each sentential paraphrase
pair, we applied the following algorithm: for each
phrase, we build the entire set of paraphrases us-
ing the previous definition. We then extract its
best paraphrase as the one exactly appearing in the
other sentence with maximum paraphrase proba-
bility, using a minimal threshold value of 10?4.
4.3 Linguistic knowledge on term variation
(Fastr)
The FASTR tool (Jacquemin, 1999) was designed
to spot term/phrase variants in large corpora.
Variants are described through metarules express-
ing how the morphosyntactic structure of a term
variant can be derived from a given term by means
of regular expressions on word morphosyntactic
categories. Paradigmatic variation can also be ex-
pressed by expressing constraints between words,
imposing that they be of the same morphologi-
cal or semantic family. Both constraints rely on
preexisting repertoires available for English and
French. To compute candidate paraphrase pairs
using FASTR, we first consider all phrases from
5http://statmt.org/europarl
the first sentence and search for variants in the
other sentence, then do the reverse process and
finally take the intersection of the two sets.
4.4 Syntactic similarity (Synt)
The algorithm introduced by Pang et al. (2003)
takes two sentences as input and merges them by
top-down syntactic fusion guided by compatible
syntactic substructure. A lexical blocking mecha-
nism prevents constituents from fusionning when
there is evidence of the presence of a word in an-
other constituent of one of the sentence. We use
the Berkeley Probabilistic parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003) to obtain syntactic trees for English
and its adapted version for French (Candito et al.,
2010). Because this process is highly sensitive to
syntactic parse errors, we use in our implemen-
tation k-best parses and retain the most compact
fusion from any pair of candidate parses.
4.5 Edit rate on word sequences (TERp)
TERp (Translation Edit Rate Plus) (Snover et al.,
2010) is a score designed for the evaluation of
Machine Translation output. Its typical use takes
a system hypothesis to compute an optimal set of
word edits that can transform it into some exist-
ing reference translation. Edit types include ex-
act word matching, word insertion and deletion,
block movement of contiguous words (computed
as an approximation), as well as optionally vari-
ants substitution through stemming, synonym or
paraphrase matching.6 Each edit type is parame-
terized by at least one weight which can be opti-
mized using e.g. hill climbing. TERp being a tun-
able metric, our experiments will include tuning
TERp systems towards either precision (? P ),
recall (? R), or F-measure (? F1).7
4.6 Evaluation of individual techniques
Results for the 5 individual techniques are given
on the left part of Table 2. It is first apparent
that all techniques but TERp fared better on the
French corpus than on the English corpus. This
can certainly be explained by the fact that the for-
mer results from more literal translations (from
6Note that for these experiments we did not use the stem-
ming module, the interface to WordNet for synonym match-
ing and the provided paraphrase table for English, due to the
fact that these resources were available for English only.
7Hill climbing was used for all tunings as done by Snover
et al. (2010), and we used one iteration starting with uniform
weights and 100 random restarts.

English to French, compared with from Chinese
to English), which should be consequently eas-
ier to word-align. This is for example clearly
shown by the results of the statistical aligner
GIZA, which obtains a 7.68 advantage on recall
for French over English.
The two linguistically-aware techniques,
FASTR and SYNT, have a very strong precision
on the more parallel French corpus, but fail to
achieve an acceptable recall on their own. This
is not surprising : FASTR metarules are focussed
on term variant extraction, and SYNT requires
two syntactic trees to be highly comparable
to extract sub-sentential paraphrases. When
these constrained conditions are met, these two
techniques appear to perform quite well in terms
of precision.
GIZA and TERp perform roughly in the same
range on French, with acceptable precision and
recall, TERp performing overall better, with e.g.
a 1.14 advantage on F-measure on French and
4.19 on English. The fact that TERp performs
comparatively better on English than on French8,
with a 1.76 advantage on F-measure, is not con-
tradictory: the implemented edit distance makes
it possible to align reasonably distant words and
phrases independently from syntax, and to find
alignments for close remaining words, so the dif-
ferences of performance between the two lan-
guages are not necessarily expected to be com-
parable with the results of a statistical alignment
technique. English being a poorly-inflected lan-
guage, alignment clues between two sentential
paraphrases are expected to be more numerous
8Recall that all specific linguistic modules for English
only from TERp had been disabled, so the better perfor-
mance on English cannot be explained by a difference in
terms of resources used.
than for highly-inflected French.
PIVOT is on par with GIZA as regards preci-
sion, but obtains a comparatively much lower re-
call (differences of 19.32 and 19.80 on recall on
French and English respectively). This may first
be due in part to the paraphrasing score threshold
used for PIVOT, but most certainly to the use of
a bilingual corpus from the domain of parliamen-
tary debates to extract paraphrases when our test
sets are from the news domain: we may be ob-
serving differences inherent to the domain, and
possibly facing the issue of numerous “out-of-
vocabulary” phrases, in particular for named en-
tities which frequently occur in the news domain.
Importantly, we can note that we obtain at best
a recall of 45.98 on French (GIZA) and of 45.37
on English (TERp). This may come as a disap-
pointment but, given the broad set of techniques
evaluated, this should rather underline the inher-
ent complexity of the task. Also, recall that the
metrics used do not consider identity paraphrases
(e.g. at the same time ? at the same time), as
well as the fact that gold standard alignment is
a very difficult process as shown by interjudge
agreement values and our example from section 3.
This, again, confirms that the task that is ad-
dressed is indeed a difficult one, and provides fur-
ther justification for initially focussing on parallel
monolingual corpora, albeit scarce, for conduct-
ing fine-grained studies on sub-sentential para-
phrasing.
Lastly, we can also note that precision is not
very high, with (at best, using TERp?P ) average
values for all techniques of 40.97 and 40.46 on
French and English, respectively. Several facts
may provide explanations for this observation.
First, it should be noted that none of those tech-
niques, except SYNT, was originally developed
721
for the task of sub-sentential paraphrase acqui-
sition from monolingual parallel corpora. This
results in definitions that are at best closely re-
lated to this task.9 Designing new techniques
was not one of the objectives of our study, so we
have reused existing techniques, originally devel-
oped with different aims (bilingual parallel cor-
pora word alignment (GIZA), term variant recog-
nition (FASTR), Machine Translation evaluation
(TERp)). Also, techniques such as GIZA and
TERp attempt to align as many words as possi-
ble in a sentence pair, when gold standard align-
ments sometimes contain gaps.10 Finally, the met-
rics used will count as false small variations of
gold standard paraphrases (e.g. missing function
word): the acceptability or not of such candi-
dates could be either evaluated in a scenario where
such “acceptable” variants would be taken into
account, and could be considered in the context
of some actual use of the acquired paraphrases
in some application. Nonetheless, on average the
techniques in our study produce more candidates
that are not in the gold standard: this will be an
important fact to keep in mind when tackling the
task of combining their outputs. In particular, we
will investigate the use of features indicating the
combination of techniques that predicted a given
paraphrase pair, aiming to capture consensus in-
formation.
5 Paraphrase validation
5.1 Technique complementarity
Before considering combining and validating the
outputs of individual techniques, it is informative
to look at some notion of “complementarity” be-
tween techniques, in terms of how many correct
paraphrases a technique would add to a combined
set. The following formula was used to account
for the complementarity between the set of can-
didates from some technique i, ti, and the set for
some technique j, tj :
C(ti, tj) = recall(ti?tj)?max(recall(ti), recall(tj))
9Recall, however, that our best performing technique on
F-measure, TERp, was optimized to our task using a held
out development set.
10It is arguable whether such cases should happen in sen-
tence pairs obtained by translating the same original sentence
into the same language, but this clearly depends on the inter-
pretation of the expected level of annotation by the annota-
tors.
Results on the test set for the two languages
are given in Table 3. A number of pairs of tech-
niques have strong complementarity values, the
strongest one being for GIZA and TERp for both
languages. According to these figures, PIVOT
identify paraphrases which are slightly more sim-
ilar to those of TERp than those of GIZA. Inter-
estingly, FASTR and SYNT exhibit a strong com-
plementarity, where in French, for instance, they
only have a very small proportion of paraphrases
in common. Considering the set of all other tech-

Table 3: Values of complementarity on the test set for
both languages, where the following formula was used
for the set of technique outputs T = {t1, t2, ..., tn} :
C(ti, tj) = recall(ti?tj)?max(recall(ti), recall(tj)).
Complementarity values are computed between all
pairs of individual techniques, and each individual
technique and the set of all other techniques. Values in
bold indicate highest values for the technique of each
row.
5.2 Naive combination by union
We first implemented a naive combination ob-
tained by taking the union of all techniques. Re-
sults are given in the first column of the right part
of Table 2. The first result is quite encouraging:
in both languages, more than 6 paraphrases from
the gold standard out of 10 are found by at least
one of the techniques, which, given our previous
discussion, constitutes a good result and provide
a clear justification for combining different tech-
niques for improving performance on this task.
Precision is mechanically lowered to account for
roughly 1 correct paraphrase over 5 candidates
for both languages. F-measure values are much
lower than those of TERp and GIZA, showing
that the union of all techniques is only interest-
ing for recall-oriented paraphrase acquisition. In
722
the next section, we will show how the results of
the union can be validated using machine learning
to improve these figures.
5.3 Paraphrase validation via automatic
classification
A natural improvement to the naive combination
of paraphrase candidates from all techniques can
consist in validating candidate paraphrases by us-
ing several models that may be good indicators of
their paraphrasing status. We can therefore cast
our problem as one of biclass classification (i.e.
“paraphrase” vs. “not paraphrase”).
We have used a maximum entropy classifier11
with the following features, aiming at capturing
information on the paraphrase status of a candi-
date pair:
Morphosyntactic equivalence (POS) It may
be the case that some sequences of part-of-speech
can be rewritten as different sequences, e.g. as
a result of verb nominalization. We therefore
use features to indicate the sequences of part-of-
speech for a pair of candidate paraphrases. We
used the preterminal symbols of the syntactic
trees of the parser used for SYNT.
Character-based distance (CAR) Morpholog-
ical variants often have close word forms, and
more generally close word forms in sentential
paraphase pairs may indicate related words. We
used features for discretized values of the edit
distance between the two phrases of a candidate
paraphrase pair as measured by the Levenshtein
distance.
Stem similarity (STEM) Inflectional morphol-
ogy, which is quite productive in languages such
as French, can increase vocabulary size signifi-
cantly, while in sentential paraphrases common
stems may indicate related words. We used a
binary feature indicating whether the stemmed
phrases of a candidate paraphrase pair match.12
Token set identity (BOW) Syntactic rearrange-
ments may involve the same sets of words in var-
ious orders. We used discretized features indicat-
ing the proportion of common tokens in the set
11We used the implementation available at:
http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/
maxent_toolkit.html
12We use the implementations of the Snowball stem-
mer from English and French available from: http://
snowball.tartarus.org
of tokens for the two phrases of a candidate para-
phrase pair.
Context similarity (CTXT) It can be derived
from the distributionality hypothesis that the more
two phrases will be seen in similar contexts, the
more they are likely to be paraphrases. We used
discretized features indicating how similar the
contexts of occurrences of two paraphrases are.
For this, we used the full set of bilingual English-
French data available for the translation task of
the Workshop on Statistical Machine Transla-
tion13, totalling roughly 30 million parallel sen-
tences: this again ensures that the same resources
are used for experiments in the two languages. We
collect all occurrences for the phrases in a pair,
and build a vector of content words cooccurring
within a distance of 10 words from each phrase.
We finally compute the cosine between the vec-
tors of the two phrases of a candidate paraphrase
pair.
Relative position in a sentence (REL) De-
pending on the language in which parallel sen-
tences are analyzed, it may be the case that sub-
sentential paraphrases occur at close locations in
their respective sentence. We used a discretized
feature indicating the relative position of the two
phrases in their original sentence.
Identity check (COOC) We used a binary fea-
ture indicating whether one of the two phrases
from a candidate pair, or the two, occurred at
some other location in the other sentence.
Phrase length ratio (LEN) We used a dis-
cretized feature indicating phrase length ratio.
Source techniques (SRC) Finally, as our set-
ting validates paraphrase candidates produced by
a set of techniques, we used features indicat-
ing which combination of techniques predicted a
paraphrase candidate. This can allow learning that
paraphrases in the intersection of the predicted
sets for some techniques may produce good re-
sults.
We used a held out training set consisting of
150 sentential paraphrase pairs from the same cor-
pora as our previous developement and test sets
for both languages. Positive examples were taken
from the candidate paraphrase pairs from any of
13http://www.statmt.org/wmt11/
translation-task.html
723
the 5 techniques in our study which belong to
the gold standard, and we used a corresponding
number of negative examples (randomly selected)
from candidate pairs not in the gold standard. The
right part of Table 2 provides the results for our
validation experiments of the union set for all pre-
vious techniques.
We obtain our best results for this study using
the output of our validation classifier over the set
of all candidate paraphrase pairs. On French, it
yields an improvement in F-measure (43.16) of
+6.46 over the best individual technique (TERp)
and of +15.63 over the naive union from all indi-
vidual techniques. On English, the improvement
in F-measure (45.37) is for the same conditions of
respectively +6.91 (over TERp) and +13.66. We
unfortunately observe an important decrease in re-
call over the naive union, of respectively -17.54
and -19.68 for French and English. Increasing our
amount of training data to better represent the full
range of paraphrase types may certainly overcome
this in part. This would indeed be sensible, as bet-
ter covering the variety of paraphrase types as a
one-time effort would help all subsequent valida-
tions. Figure 2 shows how performance varies on
French with number of training examples for var-
ious feature configurations. However, some para-
phrase types will require integration of more com-
plex knowledge, as is the case, for instance, for
paraphrase pairs involving some anaphora and its
antecedent (e.g. China? it).
While these results, which are very comparable
for the two languages studied, are already satisfy-
ing given the complexity of our task, further in-
spection of false positives and negatives may help
us to develop additional models that will help us
obtain a better classification performance.
6 Conclusions and future work
In this article, we have addressed the task of com-
bining the results of sub-sentential paraphrase ac-
quition from parallel monolingual corpora using a
large variety of techniques. We have provided jus-
tifications for using highly parallel corpora con-
sisting of multiply translated sentences from a
single language. All our experiments were con-
ducted on both English and French using com-
parable resources, so although the results cannot
be directly compared they give some acceptable
comparison points. The best recall of any indi-
vidual technique is around 45 for both language,

and F-measure in the range 36-38, indicating that
the task under study is a very challenging one.
Our validation strategy based on bi-class classi-
fication using a broad set of features applicable to
all candidate paraphrase pairs allowed us to obtain
a 18% relative improvement in F-measure over
the best individual technique for both languages.
Our future work include performing a deeper
error analysis of our current results, to better com-
prehend what characteristics of paraphrase still
defy current validation. Also, we want to inves-
tigate adding new individual techniques to pro-
vide so far unseen candidates. Another possible
approach would be to submit all pairs of sub-
sentential paraphrase pairs from a sentence pair
to our validation process, which would obviously
require some optimization and devising sensible
heuristics to limit time complexity. We also in-
tend to collect larger corpora for all other corpus
types appearing in Table 1 and conducting anew
our acquisition and validation tasks.
