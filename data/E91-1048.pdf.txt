Abstract 
The lexical transfer phase is the most crucial 
step in MT because most of difficult problems are 
caused by lexical differences between two 
languages. In order to treat lexical issues systemati- 
cally in transfer-based MT systems, we introduce 
the concept of bilingual-sings which are defined by 
pairs of equivalent monolingual signs. The bil- 
ingual signs not only relate the local linguistic 
structures of two languages but also play a central 
role in connecting the linguistic processes of transla- 
tion with knowledge based inferences. We also 
show that they can be effectively used to formulate 
appropriate questions for disambiguating "transfer 
ambiguities", which is crucial in interactive MT sys- 
tems. 
1. Introduction 
'Lexical Transfer' has always been one of the 
main sources of problems in Machine Translation 
(MT)\[Melby, 19861\[Nirenburg, 1988\]. 
Research in transfer-based MT systems has 
focussed on discovering an appropriate l vel of 
linguistic description for translation, at which we 
can specify 'translation relations" (or transfer ules) 
in a simple manner. However, lexical differences 
between languages have caused problems in this 
attempt. Besides structural changes caused by lexi- 
cal Iransfer, selecting appropriate translations of 
source lexical items has been one of the hardest 
problems in MT. 
Because languages have their own ways of 
reflecting the structure of the world in their lexi- 
cons, and the process of lexicalization is more or 
less arbitrary, bilingual knowledge about lexical 
correspondences is highly dependent on language 
pairs and individual words. We have to .prepare a 
framework in which such idiosyncratic bilingual 
knowledge about lexical items can be systemati- 
cally accumulated. 
Our approach in this paper follows the general 
trend in computational linguistics which emphasizes 
the role of the lexicon in linguistic theory. In partic- 
ular, our idea of bilingual signs shares a common 
intuition with \[Beaven, 1988\] and \[Whitelock, 
1988\]. As with their proposal, we too specify local 
structural correspondences b tween two languages in
bilingual exicons. 
Unlike former approaches, however, we expli- 
citly define bilingual signs and use them as predi. 
cates in logical formulae (bilingual pivot expres- 
sions). Bilingual signs in our framework not only 
link the local linguistic structures of two languages 
where the corresponding two monolingual signs 
appear, but also, by behaving as logical predicates, 
they connect linguistic-based processes in MT with 
inference processes. Complicated structural 
Changes, which are often required in translation of 
remote language pairs like English and Japanese, are 
captured by logical inferences \[Tsujii, 1990\]. 
The framework has the following advantages 
over conventional methods. 
(i) Reversibility of bilingual dictionaries (lexical 
transfer rules) 
(ii) Natural interfaces between knowledge-based 
(inference) processes and MT 
(iii) Ease of paraphrasing using different words 
(see section 6) 
2. Bilingual signs as logical predicates and their 
definition 
The basic idea of bilingual signs is simple. 
instead of using predicates corresponding directly to 
surface words, we use bilingual pairs of lexical 
items as predicates. That is, we use 
\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] and \[RUN:UN'EISURU\] as 
basic predicates expressing the meanings of run in 
the following sentences. 
(1) The teacher runs the program. 
(2) The teacher runs the company. 
Corresponding to the obvious meaning 
difference of run in (1) and (2), we have to use 
different surface verbs in Japanese, "jikkoosuru" for 
(1) and "un'eisuru" for (2). The bilingual sign 
\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] is a predicate which 
expresses the truth condition which an event should 
satisfy in order to be described by run in English 
and jikkoosuru in Japanese. Note that 
\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] expresses not only one 
disambiguated sense of run but also one disambi- 
- 275 - 
guated sense of the Japanese verb j ikkoosuru I.
Our system is a conventional transfer based 
MT system where the monolingual analysis and 
transfer phases are executed separately. The 
analysis phase of English produces the following 
schema of logical formulae (3) as the description of 
(1). (For simplicity, we ignore articles, quantifiers, 
etc .) 
(3) {\[RUN:?I\](e) & ARGI(e,x) & ARG2(e,y) 
& \[TEACHER:?2\](x) & \[PROGRAM:?3\](y)} 
(3) is not a logical formula in the ordinary sense but 
a schema which represents a set of possible formu- 
lae. \[RUN:?I\] is a predicate schema, and by bind- 
ing the variable '?1' to a specific Japanese verb, we 
get a specific predicate such as 
\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\], \[RUN:UN'EISURU\], etc. 
The transfer phase is taken to be a phase which 
identifies appropriate predicates in a schema of logi- 
cal formulae produced by the analysis phase. 
As in LFG \[Kaplan, 1982\], we assume that 
semantic representations (logical forms) are related 
lexically with a certain level of linguistic descrip- 
tions. Because a bilingual sign is defined by two 
languages (here English and Japanese), the two rela- 
tionships of (logical form <----> English) and (logical 
form ~ > Japanese) are specified in the same place. 
In order to avoid further complications caused by 
changes of grammatical functions (passive construc- 
tions, etc.), we use thematic role representations as 
linguistic descriptions in the definitions of bilingual 
signs. 
The following definition shows the predicate 
\[RUN:UN'EISURU\] has arity two (argl and arg2) 
and the arguments have sortal restrictions. 
(4) (Def-Pred \[RUN:UN'EISURU\] 
{argl := \[HUMAN:NINGEIq\] v 
\[ORGANIZATION:SOSHIKI\], 
arg2 := \[ORGANIZATION:SOSHIKI\], 
eng := {head := {e-lex :-- run}, 
agt := <\[ argl>, 
obj := <! arg2>}, 
jpn := \[head := {j-lex := un'eisuru}, 
agt := <\[ argl>, 
obj := <! arg2>}} )2 
This example is rather simple, since local 
linguistic structures in both languages are the same. 
That is, the agent and the object in English 
correspond to the constituents with the same 
1 jikkoosuru can be translated into several English verbs 
including run, carry out. execute, implement, practice, etc. 
2 Angle brackets '< >' show a path description and 
exclamation-mark 'I ' in the angle brackets means the smal- 
lest description block (shown by braces '{ }') which con- 
tains the description block in which the '1' appears. 
thematic roles. Note that these correspondences are 
expressed through argl and arg2 of the defined 
predicate. However, many cases have been observed 
, where lexical transfer causes tructural changes. It 
',is also the ease that objects or events describable by 
~single words in one language are described by 
phrases or clauses in other languages ( ee section 3). 
We may expect hat classes of objects/events 
which can be expressed by single words in one 
language correspond to natural classes of 
objects/events, he classes whose truth conditions are 
naturally captured by single predicates in logical 
forms. Therefore, we prepare single bilingual signs 
for expressing their truth conditions if at least one 
of the languages has lexical items \[Emele, 1990\]. 
That is, we define a single bilingual sign which 
corresponds to a complex linguistic object in one 
language, if the other language xpresses the same 
"meaning" by a single word. 
As \[Sadler, 1990\] pointed out, compared with 
other methods using arbitrary predicates in meaning 
representation, our method is well-motivated in 
selecting basic predicates. In fact, the required 
fineness of distinction of word senses depends 
highly on the target language (source words are 
translationally ambiguous \[Tsujii, 1988\]). We can 
expect the set of bilingually defined predicates to 
have appropriate, at least necessary if not sufficient, 
granularity of the semantic domains for translation 
of the two given languages. 
Furthermore, we can use logical formulae to 
specify mutual relationships among bilingual signs, 
which means that we can specify explicitly 'logical' 
relationships among iexical transfer ules (see sec- 
tion 4). 
3. Complex structural changes - complex bil- 
ingual signs 
The following show how our framework treats 
structural changes caused by lexical correspon- 
dences. 
\[A\] Case changes 
The English sentence 'l like him.' is usually 
translated into 'll me plaft.' in French. 
(5) (Def-Pred \[LIKE:PLAIRE\] 
{argl "- *~ t 
arg2 "-  
eng := {head := {e-lex := like}, 
agt := <! argl>, 
obj := <t arg2>}, 
fre := \[head := {f-lex := plalre}, 
agt := <! arg2>, 
obj := <t argl>} ) 
In our framework, corresponding case elements in 
the two languages are linked with each other 
through the same argument names of bilingual signs. 
- 276 - 
\[B\] Lexical inclusions of arguments 
A Japanese verb nuru, for example, is 
translated as paint, varnish, spread Coread with 
butter), apply (paint) etc., depending on the material 
being applied. Some of the English verbs (paint, 
varnish, etc.) include the objects (of the Japanese) in 
their meaning. For example, the structural change 
between (6a) and (6b) is treated by the definition 
(7). 
(6a) kabe-ni penki-wo nuru 
\[n:wail-loeation\] \[n:paint-object\] \[v\] 
(6b) (someone) paints the wall. 
Iv\] : \[object\] 
(7) (Def-Pred \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] 
{argl :=, 
arg2 :=, 
eng := {head := {e-lex := paint} }, 
agt := <~ argl>, 
obj := <l arg2>}, 
jpn := {head := {j-lex := nuru}, 
agt := <! argl>, 
obj := {head := {j-lex := penki}}, 
loc := <! arg2>} ) 
Note that the Japanese verb nuru governs three 
dependents but one of them is in this definition 
filled in advance by a specific noun (penki -paint 
in English). The definition shows that the phrase 
penki-wo nuru in Japanese corresponds to the 
English paint and that this correspondence d fines a 
predicate as a basic unit of semantic representation. 
\[C\] Head switching 
One of the well-known examples is the 
correspondence between the English verb like and 
the Dutch adverb graag (which roughly corresponds 
to pleasantly in English). The same! kind of 
phenomena has often been observed in itranslation 
between English and Japanese. 
The event expressed by the verb manage On 
the usage of manage to do something) is captured 
by an adverb nantoka ('somehow or other' or 'with 
great effort' in English) in Japanese. The adverb is 
used to modify the event expressed as an infinitive 
clause in English. 
The correspondence b tween (8a) and (Sb) is 
captured by the definition (9). 
(Sa) watashi-ga nantoka 
\[n:I-subject\] \[adv:somehow r other\] 
ronbun-wo shiage -ta 
\[n:paper-object\] \[v:complete\] \[tense:past\] 
(8b) I managed to complete {the/a} paper. 
(9) (Def-Pred \[MANAGE:NANTOKA\] 
{argl "- ,m • , 
arg2 := \[eVenrdekigoto\], 
eng := {head := {e-lex := manage}, 
agt := <! argl>, 
evt := <! arg2>}, 
jpn := {<I arg2>, 
agt := <l argl>, 
lady := {head := {j-lex := nantoka}  } })3 
In this example, though the adverb nanwka is not 
the head of the Japanese deep case description 
('jpn'), it is converted into the predicate 
\[MANAGE:NANTOKA\] in the logical formula, and 
the rest of the 'jpn' description into arg2. 
\[Kaplan,: 1989\] proposed two ways of treating 
such head-switching phenomena, one monolingual 
and the other bilingual. Our treatment in this paper 
is basically bilingual in the sense that the non-head 
construction in Japanese is directly related with the 
English construction in which the corresponding ele- 
ment is expressed as the head. However• if we deem 
the logical level of representation a separate, more 
abstract but mono-lingual evel of representation, 
then our method is quite close to the mono-lingual 
treatment suggested by \[Zajac, 1990\]. Our conten- 
tion is that suoh an abstract level of representation is 
hard to justify by purely mono-lingual considera- 
tions but only possible by bilingual (or multi- 
lingual) considerations. 
4. Definition o f  sort hierarchies 
Sort-subsort relationships among object-sorts 
such as '\[TEACHER:SENSEI\] is a 
\[HUMAN:NINGEN\]', etc. are expressed in conven- 
tional logic by implications. However, logical impli- 
cations expreSs various ontologically different rela- 
tionships amoiig formulae, which have to be treated 
differently in translation. Sortal relationships uch 
as these are of special importance in translation, 
because they l give alternative linguistic means of 
describing the same events/objects (a supersort gives 
a more vague, less specific description than the 
subsort). We explicitly indicate that a given implica- 
tion expresses a sortal relationship, as follows. 
3 We introduce a new notation. '{<1 arg2>,'/adv := 
{...}}' means that the evenffobject described by rids whole 
description block minus 'adv:={...)' corresponds to the arg2 
of the description block immediately above, and '/adv:={...}' 
is convened into a predicate atthe logical level Note that 
our treatment of 'nentoka' is essentially the same as the 
treatment of 'gnta 8' in the MiMe2 formalism \[van Noord, 
1990\] m that it has the same defect. That h, it cannot cope 
with cases where more than two words which require 'rais- 
ing' like 'nantcka' occur at the same level. 
- 277 - 
(Sort-subsort elationships of event-sorts can also be 
defined in the same manner). 
(10) (-> SUB:\[TEACHER:SENSEI\](x) 
SUP: \[HUMAN:NINGEN\] (x)). 
('->' means logical implication) 
(10) shows that, if x is describable by teacher (or 
sensei in Japanese), the same object can be 
described by a less accurate word like human. We 
deem the process of selecting an appropriate target 
expression among possible candidates as the process 
of locating a expression with the appropriate vague- 
ness level. 
The English verb wear is a well-known exam- 
ple of a translationaUy ambiguous word when it is 
translated into Japanese. It can be translated into 
several different verbs including haku ('wear 
shoes'), kaburu ('wear a hat'), kakeru ('wear specta- 
cles'), kiru ('wear clothes'), etc., depending on what 
is worn. While we have a complex expression mini- 
tsukeru (mi - body, ni particle, tsukeru - put on) in 
Japanese which preserves almost the same vague- 
ness as wear, to use this as the translation of wear 
leads to an awkward translation if the material to be 
worn belongs to a specific sort. kutsu(shoes)-wo 
mini-tsukeru, for example, tends to be understood 
as "the shoes are worn on a non-standard of the 
body (not on the fee0". 
The predicate \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] can 
be defined in a way similar to \[PAINT:PENKI- 
WO-NURU\] in (7). 
(11) (Def-Pred \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] 
{argl := \[HUMAN:NINGEN\], 
arg2 :=, 
eng := {head := {e-lex := wear}, 
agt := <I argl>, 
obj := <! arg2>}; 
jpn := {head := {j-lex := tsukeru}, 
agt := <! argl>, 
obj := <! arg2>, 
loc := {head := {j-lex := mi} } } }) 
The sort-subsort elations between \[WEAR:MI-NI- 
TSUKERU\] and \[WEAR:HAKU\] can be defined as 
follows. 
(12) (<->> 
SUB:\[WEAR:HAKU\] 
SUP: \[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] 
CON:ARG2(self, x) & \[SHOES:KUTSU\](x)). 
The schema (12) which is specified by '<->>' 
expresses that 
(i) \[WEAR:HAKU\] is a subsort of \[WEAR:MI- 
NI-TSUKERU\], 
(ii) if an event - se l f -  belongs to the sort 
\[WEAR:MI-NI-TSUKERU\] and if the 
argument-2 of the event belongs to the sort 
\[SHOES:KUTSU\], then the event also belongs 
to \[WEAR:HAKU\]. 
All the event-sorts related with wear in the 
above have the same argument structure (arity and 
role). But this continuity of argument structures 
through sorts is not necessarily guaranteed. A sort 
can have multiple supersorts and so the continuity 
of argument structures from different supersorts may 
conflict with each other. Furthermore, it is some- 
times the case that the arities of events change 
between a sort and its subsorts. For example, sup- 
pose that we have two event sorts \[APPLY:NURU\] 
(this event-sort corresponds to the usage of apply in 
apply glue~paint to ...) and \[PAINT:PENKI-WO- 
NURU\], and that we define the latter as a subsort of 
the former. Then, one of the arguments in the super- 
sort \[APPLY:NURU\] is lexically included in the 
subsort \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] so that these 
two sorts basically have different arities. The 
definition of \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] is already 
given as (7). The definition of \[APPLY:NURU\] is 
given as follows. 
(13) (Def-Pred \[APPLY:NURU\] 
{argl :=, 
arg2 := \[PAINT:PENKI\] v \[GLUE:NORI\], 
arg3 :=, 
eng := {head := {e-lex := apply-to}, 
agt := <l argl>, 
obj := <! arg2>, 
loc := <l arg3>}, 
jpn := {head := {j-lex := nuru} 
agt := <! argl>, 
obj := <l arg2>, 
loc := <l arg3>} }) 
The sort relationship between \[APPLY:NURU\] and 
\[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] is defined as follows. 
(14) (<->> (<*.ARG2>,<ARG2.ARG3>) 
SUB: \[PAINT:PENKI-WO-NURU\] 
SUP: \[APPLY:NURU\] 
CON:ARG2(self, x) & \[PAINT:PENKI\](x)) 
'<*.ARG2>' and '<ARG2.ARG3>' in this notation 
mean that the argument-2 in the supersort disappears 
in the subsort and that the argument-3 in the super- 
sort is mapped to the argument-2 in the subsort. 
'ARGi' in the CON-part is taken as referring to the 
argument structures of the supersorL Unspecified 
arguments remain unchanged between the sorts. 
5. Sketch of the Transfer Phase 
The transfer phase is divided into three sub- 
phases as follows. 
(a) Transforming from thematic role structures of 
source sentences into schema of logical 
formulae(like (3)) 
- 278 - 
(b) Determining logical formulae by 
descending/ascending sort hierarchies" during 
this phase, inferences based on knowledge are 
made, and questions are asked to users, if 
necessary. 
(c) Transforming from logical formulae to 
thematic role structures in the target. 
All of these steps are performed by referring 
to the definitions of bilingual signs. 
We can index each bilingual sign by the sur- 
face word whose 'meaning': is expressed by the 
sign. Roughly speaking, a :word indexing a bil- 
ingual sign is either the word which appears as head 
in the linguistic form definitions or the word which 
is the value in a feature marked by '/' (like nantoka 
in the example \[MANAGE:NANTOKA\]). 
Step (a) in the above is a rather straightfor- 
ward process which can be recursively performed 
through thematic structures. At each recursion level, 
the system 
(i) identifies the (semantic) head of the level, 
(ii) retrieves the vaguest possible bilingual signs 
for the head word 
(iii) transforms the local structures governed by 
the head word according to the definition of 
the bilingual signs retrieved at (ii). 
Because a predicate schema of a Word may 
have several possible vaguest sons, step (a) pro- 
duces several formulae which step (b)i tries to 
transform into more appropriate formulae. The 
processes of descending in sort hierarchies (disambi- 
guation processes necessary for translation) are per- 
formed for different predicate schemata simultane- 
ously (for verbs and nouns which are related to each 
other). 
Ascending the hierarchies is also: required, 
because the system has to instantiate all the predi- 
cate schemata contained in formula, and constraints 
imposed by different predicates in a schema of for- 
mulae may conflict with each other. It: may also 
happen that there are no corresponding target lexi- 
cal items for source items, fin these cases, the sys- 
tem has to loosen constraints by ascending hierar- 
chies. Therefore, step (b)i is a kind of relaxation 
process which tries to find the most accurate solu- 
tions satisfying all constraints. During this process, 
some general inference mechanisms may be invoked 
to infer necessary information for navigating in 
hierarchies and, if necessary, questions will be 
posed to human users. 
\[Estival, 1990\] also proposed using a partial 
order of transfer ules to choose preferred transla- 
tions or prevent less preferred translations from 
being generated. He assumes that such a partial 
order of rules can be automatically computed in 
terms of specificities of conditions on individual 
transfer ules. We also use a partial order of rules 
(in our case, lexical transfer ules) to choose transla. 
tions, but the SlJecificity relationships in our system 
are concerned With lexical semantics and are not 
automatically computed but defined externally by a 
human based on his/her bilingual intuition. These 
externally imposed specificity (sort-subsort) rela. 
tionships also define possible paraphrasing and are 
effectively used:to disambiguate ransfer ambiguitie s 
by dialogue. 
6. Disambiguation of transfer ambiguities by 
paraphrasing 
Because of the explicitness of mutual relation, 
ships in the sort hierarchies, we can easily express 
an event (or object) in diversified ways in both 
languages. This paraphrasing facility is very useful 
for forming and posing appropriate questions during 
the transfer phase to monolingual users of the 
source language. 
Consider the following situation: 
(15a) Input sentence: The teacher uns X. 
(15b) System's knowledge about sons: 
\ [RUN:HASHIRASERU\] 
\[EXECUTE.J1KKOOSURU\] I \ [MANAGE:KEIEISURU\] 
I I I 
I I I I 
lRUN:J IKKOOSURU\] \ [RUN:UN'EISURU\]  
As we have already seen, run can be translated into 
several different verbs in Japanese. Suppose that the 
sort \[RUN:HKSHIRASERU\] is the least specific sort 
which run can: describe. An event of this sort can be 
directly transformed into Japanese expressions by 
using hashiraseru. However, the direct translation is 
sometimes awkward if more specific lexical items 
exist. 
The system tries to descend in the hierarchy. 
In this example, there are two candidates: 
\[RUN:JIKKOOSURU\] and \[RUN:UN'EISURU\]. 
Three ways of disambiguation by questions are pos- 
sible : verbalize sort restrictions on arguments 
directly (ex: (16)), use the other event-sons which 
are not shared by both sorts such as (17), and use 
these two strategies (ex: (18)). 
(16) Is X an organization or a computer program ?
(17) Does the teacher execute X or does the 
teacher manage X ? 
(18) Does the teacher execute X \[a program\] or 
does the teacher manage X \[an organization\] 9. 
7. Conelusioln and further discussion 
In this paper, we have shown that 
(a) our idea of bilingual signs is useful for 
representing the relations among lexical 
transfer rules which in traditional systems 
- 279 - 
have not been captured explicitly. By using 
these relationships, we can pose appropriate 
questions to the user for disambiguation. 
(b) transfer ules which are written in our frame- 
work are basically reversible. 
(c) the bilingual signs connect the linguistic forms 
of two languages and general knowledge 
about events/objects denoted by them 
(knowledge about sort hierarchies i the sim- 
plest example of this type of knowledge) in a 
natural way. 
In our future research, we have to make it 
clear to what extent we can treat structural changes 
by bilingual signs, and on the other hand, to what 
extent global structural changes beyond the local 
restructuring by bilingual signs are necessary. We 
think at present hat most of the global structural 
changes in conventional transfer systems, though 
necessary for natural translations, actually change 
the "meanings" of source sentences and should be 
treated by inference mechanisms external to the 
"linguistic" processing in translation. Though we 
only treat the predicates and arguments of bilingual 
signs, we would have to treat adjuncts as well in 
order to translate a whole sentence. This is related 
to how to control the rule application and how to 
ensure that all the parts of the source structure are 
processed. The method of formulating questions for 
disambiguation is still incomplete, though our 
method seems promising. We have to investigate 
what sorts of paraphrasing are really helpful for 
making bilingual ambiguities obvious to monol- 
ingual users.
