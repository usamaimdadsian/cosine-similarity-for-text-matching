We present results of probabilistic tag- 
ging of Czech texts in order to show how 
these techniques work for one of the highly 
morphologically ambiguous inflective lan- 
guages. After description of the tag system 
used, we show the results of four experi- 
ments using a simple probabilistic model 
to tag Czech texts (unigram, two bigram 
experiments, and a trigram one). For com- 
parison, we have applied the same code and 
settings to tag an English text (another 
four experiments) using the same size of 
training and test data in the experiments in 
order to avoid any doubt concerning the va- 
lidity of the comparison. The experiments 
use the source channel model and maxi- 
mum likelihood training on a Czech hand- 
tagged corpus and on tagged Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ) from the LDC collection. 
The experiments how (not surprisingly) 
that the more training data, the better is 
the success rate. The results also indicate 
that for inflective languages with 1000+ 
tags we have to develop a more sophisti- 
cated approach in order to get closer to an 
acceptable rror rate. In order to compare 
two different approaches to text tagging - -  
statistical and rule-based - -  we modified 
Eric Brill's rule-based part of speech tag- 
ger and carried out two more experiments 
on the Czech data, obtaining similar results 
in terms of the error rate. We have also 
run three more experiments with greatly 
reduced tagset to get another comparison 
based on similar tagset size. 
1 INTRODUCTION 
Languages with rich inflection like Czech pose a 
special problem for morphological disambiguation 
(which is usually called tagging1). For example, the 
ending "-u" is not only highly ambiguous, but at the 
same time it carries complex information: it corre- 
sponds to the genitive, the dative and the locative 
singular for inanimate nouns, or the dative singu- 
lar for animate nouns, or the accusative singular for 
feminine nouns, or the first person singular present 
tense active participle for certain verbs. There are 
two different echniques for text tagging: a stochas- 
tic technique and a rule-based technique. Each ap- 
proach has some advantages - - for stochastic tech- 
niques there exists a good theoretical framework, 
probabilities provide a straightforward way how to 
disambiguate tags for each word and probabilities 
can be acquired automatically from the data; for 
rule-based techniques the set of meaningful rules is 
automatically acquired and there exists an easy way 
how to find and implement improvements of the tag- 
ger. Small set of rules can be used, in contrast o the 
large statistical tables. Given the success of statis- 
tical methods in different areas, including text tag- 
ging, given the very positive results of English statis- 
tical taggers and given the fact that there existed no 
statistical tagger for any Slavic language we wanted 
to apply statistical methods even for the Czech lan- 
guage although it exhibits a rich inflection accom- 
panied by a high degree of ambiguity. Originally, 
we expected that the result would be plain negative, 
getting no more than about two thirds of the tags 
correct. However, as we show below, we got bet- 
ter results than we had expected. We used the same 
statistical approach to tag both the English text and 
the Czech text. For English, we obtained results 
comparable with the results presented in (Merialdo, 
1992) as well as in (Church, 1992). For Czech, we ob- 
tained results which are less satisfactory than those 
for English. Given the comparabil ity of the accu- 
racy of the rule-based part-of-speech (POS) tagger 
(Brill, 1992) with the accuracy of the stochastic tag- 
IThe development of automatic tagging of Czech 
is/was supported fully or partially by the fol- 
lowing grants/projects: Charles University GAUK

ger and given the fact that a rule-based POS tagger 
has never been used for a Slavic language we have 
tried to apply rule-based methods even for Czech. 
2 STAT IST ICAL  EXPERIMENTS 
2.1 CZECH EXPERIMENTS 
2.1.1 CZECH TAGSET 
Czech experiment is based upon ten basic POS 
classes and the tags describe the possible combina- 
tions of morphological categories for each POS class. 
In most cases, the first letter of the tag denotes the 
part-of-speech; the letters and numbers which follow 
it describe combinations of morphological categories 
(for a detailed description, see Table 2.1 and Table

Not all possible combinations of morphological 
categories are meaningful, however. In addition to 
these usual tags we have used special tags for sen- 
tence boundaries, punctuation and a so called "un- 
known tag". In the experiments, we used only those 
tags which occurred at least once in the training cor- 
pus. To illustrate the form of the tagged text, we 
present here the following examples from our train- 
ing data, with comments:

2.1.2 CZECH TRAIN ING DATA 
For training, we used the corpus collected dur- 
ing the 1960's and 1970's in the Institute for Czech 
Language at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. 
The corpus was originally hand-tagged, including 
the lemmatization and syntactic tags. We had to 
do some cleaning, which means that we have disre- 
garded the lemmatization i formation and the syn- 
tactic tag, as we were interested in words and tags 
only. Tags used in this corpus were different from 
our suggested tags: number of morphological cate- 
gories was higher in the original sample and the no- 
tation was also different. Thus we had to carry out 
conversions of the original data into the format pre- 
sented above, which resulted in the so-called Czech 
"modified" corpus, with the following features: 
tokens 621 015 
words 72 445 
tags 1 171 
average number of tags per token 3.65 
Table 2.3 
V~Te used the complete "modified" corpus 
(621015 tokens) in the experiments No. 1, No. 3, 
No. 4 and a small part of this corpus in the experi- 
ment No. 2, as indicated in Table 2.4. 
tokens 110 874 
words 22 530 
tags 882 
average number of tags per token 2.36

2.2 ENGL ISH EXPERIMENTS 
2.2.1 ENGL ISH TAGSET 
For the tagging of English texts, we used the 
Penn Treebank tagset which contains 36 POS tags 
and 12 other tags (for punctuation and the currency 
symbol). A detailed description is available in (San- 
torini, 1990). 
2.2.2 ENGLISH TRAIN ING DATA 
For training in the English experiments, we used 
WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993). We had to change the 
format of WSJ to prepare it for our tagging soft- 
ware. V~e used a small (100k tokens) part of WSJ in 
the experiment No. 6 and the complete corpus (1M 
tokens) in the experiments No. 5, No. 7 and No. 
8. Table 2.5 contains the basic characteristics of the 
training data.

Differences between Czech as a morphologically am- 
biguous inflective language and English as language 
with poor inflection are also reflected in the number 
of tag bigrams and tag trigrams. The figures given 
in Table 2.6 and 2.7 were obtained from the training 
files.

It is interesting to note the frequencies of the 
most ambiguous tokens encountered in the whole 
"modified" corpus and to compare them with the 
English data. Table 2.8 and Table 2.9 contain the 
first tokens with the highest number of possible tags 
in the complete Czech "modified" corpus and in the 
complete WSJ.

Table 2.8 
In the Czech "modified" corpus, the token "ve-

two different tags: 13 tags for adjective and 9 tags 
113 
for noun. The token "vedoucf' means either: "lead- 
ing" (adjective) or "manager" or "boss" (noun). The 
following columns represent the tags for the token 
"vedouc/" and their frequencies in the training data; 
for example "vedoucf' was tagged twice as adjective, 
feminine, plural, nominative, first degree, affirma- 
tive.

It is clear from these figures that the two lan- 
guages in question have quite different properties 
and that nothing can be said without really going 
through an experiment. 
2.4 THE ALGORITHM 
We have used the basic source channel model (de- 
scribed e.g. in (Merialdo, 1992)). The tagging pro- 
cedure ¢ selects a sequence of tags T for the sentence 
W: ¢ : PV --+ T . In this case the optimal tagging 
procedure is
¢(W) -- argmaxTPr(T \ [W)  = 
: a rgmaxTPr (T lW)  * P r (W)  = 
= argrnaxTPr(W,T)  = 
-- a rgmaxTPr (W\[T)  * Pr(T) .  
Our implementation is based on generating the 
(W,T) pairs by means of a probabilistic model 
using approximations of probability distributions 
Pr (WIT)  and Pr(T) .  The Pr (T)  is based on tag bi- 
grams and trigrams, and Pr (WIT  ) is approximated 
as the product of Pr(wi\[tl). The parameters have 
been estimated by the usual maximum likelihood 
training method, i.e. we approximated them as the 
relative frequencies found in the training data with 
smoothing based on estimated unigram probability 
and uniform distributions.

These results show, not surprisingly, of course, 
that the more data, the better (results experiments 
of No.2 vs. No.3), but in order to get better results 
for a trigram tag prediction model, we would need 
far more data. Clearly, if 88% trigrams occur four 
times or less, then the statistics is not reliable. The 
following tables show a detailed analysis of the errors 
of the trigram experiment.

The letters in the first column and row denote 
POS classes, the interpunction (T) and the "un- 
known tag" (X). The numbers how how many times 
the tagger assigned an incorrect POS tag to a to- 
ken in the test file. The total number of errors was 
244. Altogether, fifty times the adjectives (A) were 
114 
tagged incorrectly, nouns (N) 93 times, numbers (C) 
5 times and etc. (see the last unmarked column in 
Table 2.11b); to provide a better insight, we should 
add that in 32 cases, when the adjective was cor- 
rectly tagged as an adjective, but the mistakes ap- 
peared in the assignment ofmorphological categories 
(see Table 2.12), 6 times the adjective was tagged as 
a noun, twice as a pronoun, 3 times as an adverb 
and so on (see the second row in Table 2.11a). A 
detailed look at Table 2.12 reveals that for 32 cor- 
rectly marked adjectives the mistakes was 17 times 
in gender, once in number, three times in gender and 
case simultaneously and so on.

2.6 A PROTOTYPE OF  RANK XEROX 
POS TAGGER FOR CZECH 
(Schiller, 1996) describes the general architecture of
the tool for noun phrase mark-up based on finite- 
state techniques and statistical part-of-speech dis- 
ambiguation for seven European languages. For 
Czech, we created a prototype of the first step of 
this process - -  the part-of-speech (POS) tagger - -  
using Rank Xerox tools (Tapanainen, 1995), (Cut- 
ting et al., 1992). 
2.6.1 POS TAGSET 
The first step of POS tagging is obviously a def- 
inition of the POS tags. We performed three ex-

periments. These experiments differ in the POS 
tagset. During the first experiment we designed 
tagset which contains 47 tags. The POS tagset can 
be described as follows:

of the results and the more comparable are the Czech 
and English results. However, the difference in the 
error rate is still more than visible - -  here we can 
speculate that the reason is that Czech is "free" word 
order language, whereas English is not.

Table 2.19 
The analysis of the results of the first experiment 
showed very high ambiguity between the nominative 
and accusative cases of nouns, adjectives, pronouns 
and numerals. That is why we replaced the tags 
for nominative and accusative of nouns, adjectives, 
pronouns and numerals by new tags NOUNANA, 
ADJANA, PRONANA and NUMANA (meaning nom- 
inative or accusative, undistinguished). The rest of 
the tags stayed unchanged. This led 43 POS tags. 
In the third experiment we deleted the morphologi- 
cal information for nouns and adjectives alltogether. 
This process resulted in the final 34 POS tags. 
3 A RULE-BASED EXPERIMENT 
FOR CZECH 
A simple rule-based part of speech (RBPOS) tag- 
ger is introduced in (Brill, 1992). The accuracy of 
this tagger for English is comparable to a stochas- 
tic English POS tagger. From our point of view, it 
is very interesting to compare the results of Czech 
stochastic POS (SPOS) tagger and a modified RB- 
POS tagger for Czech. 
3.1 TRAIN ING DATA 
We used the same corpus used in the case of the 
SPOS tagger for Czech. RBPOS requires different 
input format; we thus converted the whole corpus 
into this format, preserving the original contents. 
3.2 LEARNING 
It is an obvious fact that the Czech tagset is totally 
different from the English tagset. Therefore, we had 
to modify the method for the initial guess. For Czech 
the algorithm is: "If the word is W_SB (sentence 
boundary) assign the tag T_SB, otherwise assign the 
tag NNSI." 
3.2.1 LEARNING RULES TO PREDICT  
THE MOST L IKELY  TAG FOR 
UNKNOWN WORDS 
The first stage of training is learning rules to 
predict the most likely tag for unknown words. 
These rules operate on word types; for example, if

We present here an example of rules taken from 
LEXRULEOUTFILE from the exp. No. 1: 
u hassuf 1 NIS2 # change the tag to NIS2 
if the suffix is "u" 
y hassuf 1 NFS2 # change the tag to NFS2 
if the suffix is "y" 
ho hassuf 2 AIS21A # change the tag to AIS21A 
if the suffix is "ho" 
£ch hassuf 3 NFP6 # change the tag to NFP6 
if the suffix is "£ch" 
nej addpref 3 O2A # change the tag to O2A 
if adding the prefix "nej" 
results in a word 
3.2 .2  LEARNING CONTEXTUAL CUES 
The second stage of training is learning rules to 
improve tagging accuracy based on contextual cues. 
These rules operate on individual word tokens. 
4We use the same names of files and variables as 
Eric Brill in the rule-based POS tagger's documenta- 
tion. TAGGED-CORPUS - -  manually tagged train- 
ing corpus, UNTAGGED-CORPUS - -  collection of 
all untagged texts, LEXRULEOUTFILE - -  the list 
of transformations to determine the most likely tag 
for unknown words, TAGGED-CORPUS-2 - -  manually 
tagged training corpus, TAGGED-CORPUS-ENTIRE 
- -  Czech "modified" corpus (the entire manually tagged 
corpus), CONTEXT-RULEFILE - -  the list of transfor- 
mations to improve accuracy based on contextual cues.

4 CONCLUSION 
The results, though they might seem negative com- 
pared to English, are still better than our original ex- 
pectations. Before trying some completely different 
approach, we would like to improve the current sim- 
ple approach by some other simple measures: adding 
a morphological nalyzer (Hajji, 1994) as a front- 
end to the tagger (serving as a "supplier" of pos- 
sible tags, instead of just taking all tags occurring 
in the training data for a given token), simplifying 
the tagset, adding more data. However, the desired 
positive effect of some of these measures i not guar- 
anteed: for example, the average number of tags per 
117 
token will increase after a morphological nalyzer 
is added. Success should be guaranteed, however, 
by certain tagset reductions, as the original tagset 
(even after the reductions mentioned above) is still 
too detailed. This is especially true when comparing 
it to English, where some tags represent, in fact, a 
set of tags to be discriminated later (if ever). For ex- 
ample, the tag VB used in the WSJ corpus actually 
means "one of the (five different) tags for 1st person 
sg., 2nd person sg., 1st person pl., etc.". First, we 
will reduce the tagset o correspond to our morpho- 
logical analyzer which already uses a reduced one. 
Then, the tagset will be reduced even further, but 
nevertheless, not as much as we did for the Xerox- 
tools-based experiment, because that tagset is too 
"rough" for many applications, even though the re- 
sults are good. 
Regarding tagset reduction, we should note that 
we haven't performed a "combined" experiment, i.e. 
using the full (1100+) tagset for (thus) "interme- 
diate" tagging, but only the reduced tagset for the 
final results. However, it can be quite simply derived 
from the tables 2.10, 2.11a and 2.11b, that the error 
rate would not drop much: it will remain high at 
about 6.5070 (based on the results of experiment No. 
4) using the very small tagset of 12 (= number or 
lines in table 2.11a) tags used for part of speech iden- 
tification. This is even much higher than the error 
rate reported here for the smallest tagset used in the 
'pure' experiment (sect. 2.6, table 2.20), which was 
at 3.8~0. This suggests that maybe the pure meth- 
ods (which are obviously also simple to implement) 
are in general better than the "combined" methods. 
Another possibility of an improvement is to add 
more data to allow for more reliable trigram esti- 
mates. We will also add contemporary newspaper 
texts to our training data in order to account for 
recent language development. Hedging against fail- 
ure of all these simple improvements, we are also 
working on a different model using independent pre- 
dictions for certain grammatical categories (and the 
lemma itself), but the final shape of the model has 
not yet been determined. This would mean to intro- 
duce constraints on possible combinations of mor- 
phological categories and take them into account 
when "assembling" the final tag.
