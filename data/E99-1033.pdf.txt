Abstract 
In this paper we propose a methodology 
for investigating the relationship between 
architectures of natural anguage genera- 
tion (NLG) systems and stylistic proper- 
ties of texts. Biber's (1988) methodology 
is used to obtain both the characterisation 
of style of our corpus and the division of 
the corpus into sets of linguistically 
similar texts. These sets will be used for 
studying the architectural spects. 
1 Introduction 
We started our research with a survey of 19 ap- 
plied natural anguage generation (NLG) systems 
(Paiva, 1998) and noticed that: 
• almost all the systems followed a pipeline 
model; 
• there was a general agreement on the core 
NLG tasks that a system should perform 
(e.g., aggregation, lexicalisation, etc.); 
• the surveyed systems mainly differed on 
the order the NLG tasks are executed (see 
Cahill et al., 1999); 
We also noticed that the texts produced by the 
various systems were apparently quite different 
stylistically (although we did not have a formal 
method to measure how much different they 
were) and, in order to explain how this variety of 
texts was obtained with the same type of archi- 
tecture (i.e., pipeline), we have put forward the 
hypothesis that the order in which the NLG tasks 
are executed influences the kind of text that can 
be obtained, i.e. a certain order would facilitate 
the generation of a certain type of text whilst 
another would not. 
This hypothesis goes in line with other re- 
searchers' results which purport to show that 
architectural spects of a NLG system depend on 
the characteristics of the text to be generated and 
vice versa. For instance: 
237 
• Robin (1994) argues for a revision- 
incremental rchitecture for the generation 
of structurally complex text with floating 
content - -  i.e., content that can appear 
anywhere in the text and is opportunisti- 
cally realised only if stylistic factors of the 
surrounding text allow; 
• Inui and colleagues (1992) conclude that 
in order to avoid the generation of text 
with ambiguous and complex sentences a 
revision architecture is necessary, with the 
revision module placed at the end of the 
generation process (i.e., after the linguistic 
realisation)l; 
• Reiter (ms.) reports that pipeline architec- 
tures cannot deal with constraints on the 
length of a text. 
It is difficult however to reconcile their results 
in a unified perspective since each of these re- 
ported works started with a different perspective 
and, generally, had different aims in mind. 
We believe that it is possible to relate those 
characteristics of text presented above (such as 
complexity, ambiguity and sentence length) 2 to 
style, 3 and that we can gain insight into NLG ar- 
chitectures having a systematic way to classify 
texts by their stylistic properties o that we can 
analyse the architectural aspects in relation to 
this stylistic classification. 
We then start with the point of view that it is 
reasonable to assume that certain styles of text 
demand a more specialised type of architecture 
than others (for example, a revision versus a 
pipeline architecture 4) and our idea is to develop 
a methodology for studying which are the appro- 
Some aspects related to the complexity of a sentence (e.g., 
sentence length) can only be measured precisely when the 
text has already been generated. 
2 For instance, complexity and (lack of) ambiguity are 
factors that can be related to the 'clarity" of a text. 
3 Depending on the definition we assume for it.

In this figure, one group expresses texts that

(text ype 2) expresses texts that are informal, 
highly concise, and highly interactive (e.g., 
short articles in 'IV magazines answering 
readers' questions). A third one (text ype 3) 
can be considered neither formal nor infor- 
mal, is not concise and has a medium value 
for interacfiveness.

priate architectures for the generation of texts in 
a specific style or more than one style. 
Hovy (1988) used a similar approach but char- 
acterised style in such an informal way that its 
relation to architectural aspects was compro- 
mised; in particular, he could not ensure that he 
was not missing important relations between 
style and generator decisions s.
In this paper we will present a characterisation 
of style and an approach for dealing with it 
which, we hope, will provide a means to clarify 
the interaction between the architectures of NLG 
systems and the type of texts they can, or need 
to, generate. The paper continues in the follow- 
ing way: in Section 2 we present the definition of 
style we are working with and in Section 3 we 
show how this characterisation will help us to 
deal with aspects of architecture. In Section 4 we 
discuss the expected results and, finally, we con- 
clude by presenting where we are in this process. 
2 Investigating Style 
We use the term style to signify the variability in 
the use of features of a language that can be cor- 
related with certain types of situation - -  where 
situation can be regarded "as the context within 
which interaction of 'the speech event' occurs" 
(Brown and Fraser, 1979; p. 34), involving the 
participants, the setting and the purposes of the 
communication. 
In order to put this definition to work on our 
problem, first we need to know how to obtain the 
set of stylistic parameters, i.e., the parameters 
that, when varied, will be responsible for pro- 
ducing texts in different styles. Secondly, we 
need to find a way to group stylistically-similar 
texts into sets so that we can study the architec- 
5 "The specific pragmatic \[and stylistic\] features used by

tural aspects of each set isolatedly and then try to 
have a more general view of how style and NLG 
architectures interact by making a cross- 
comparison among those isolated analyses. 
For the first part, there are two approaches in 
the literature linking stylistic parameters to char- 
acteristics of texts. We have already cited Hovy 
(1988) and its main problem: the lack of formal- 
ity. DiMarco's (1990) approach was to construct 
a 'stylistic grammar' using the notion of norm 
and deviation from norm (see, e.g., Enkvist 
(1973)). While this approach is enough to obtain 
the stylistic parameters 6, we think that this char- 
acterisation brings a problem for grouping texts 
into sets - -  it can create only two sets for study- 
ing: the texts that agree with the norm and those 
that do not. This can be a problem because, al- 
though the texts following the norm will com- 
prise a set of similar texts, those in the 'deviant' 
set can be so dissimilar that any type of analysis 
based on them (and, consequently, its interpreta- 
tion in architectural terms) is probably doomed 
to failure. 
In our approach we will avoid these problems 
by following a methodology that can provide two 
things: (1) a characterisation f the stylistic pa- 
rameters of a corpus 7, and (2) a partition of a 
corpus into sets of linguistically similar texts. We 
are working with Biber's (1988) methodology. 
From a corpus tagged with a comprehensive s t 
of linguistic features of English, we obtain the 
frequency count associated with each one) Using 
a statistical factor analysis, we group the linguis- 
tic features that co-occur, considering each group

audiences (patients and doctors) o f  more than 250 phar- 
maceutical products - -  in total it is more than 500 texts. 
s There are two levels of tagging. First, the corpus is tagged 
using Bri l l 's  (1994) tagger. Secondly, programs for 
counting specif ic configurations of tags are run. The proc- 
ess is completely automatic.

a stylistic parameter 9 that can then be analysed in 
functional terms, l° Several stylistic parameters 
can emerge from a corpus, each text of the cor- 
pus having a specific value for each of them (see 
an example with three stylistic parameters in 
Figure l-A). 
Our interest in Biber's work is also related to 
his definition of text types: "the texts within each 
type are maximally similar with respect o their 
linguistic characteristics, while the types are 
maximally distinct with respect to their linguistic 
characteristics" (Biber (1995), p. 10). In order to 
obtain the text types, a cluster analysis is used 
and results in the partitioning of the corpus (i.e., 
the texts with similar values for all the stylistic 
parameters will be grouped in a partition (see 
Figure I-B)). Following this procedure will al- 
low us to analyse aspects of architecture for each 
text type (i.e., each partition) in isolation and, 
more importantly, make cross-comparisons 
among these analyses. 
3 Relating Style to Architecture 
We are using NLG tasks as the basis for our ap- 
proach to relate style to NIX3 architectures. We 
are working with a set of core NLG task that we 
have found to be stable: all of them occurred in 
almost all the systems we surveyed (Paiva, 
1998). The set comprises the following tasks: 
content determination, rhetorical structuring, 
lexicalisation, intra and inter-sentential ordering, 
referring expression generation, aggregation, 
segmentation, and linguistic realisation (for an 
explanation about those task, see Cahill et al., 
1999). ~l 
Part of the process for relating style to archi- 
tecture is depicted in Figure 2. As shown, we 
start by analysing the NLG tasks that are respon- 
sible for the presence of a specific linguistic 
feature (arrow B). The association of stylistic 
parameters with linguistic features obtained in 
the corpus analysis (arrow A) will be used to 
observe which NLG tasks are responsible for 
9 Biber efers to this as a 'dimension ofregister variation'. 
raThe assumption is that strong co-occurrence patterns of 
linguistic features mark underlying functional dimensions 
(Biber, 1988; p. 13). Notice that he name of each stylistic 
parameter, per se, means nothing; it is the linguistic fea- 
tures grouped in each stylistic parameter that are impor- 
tant! Nonetheless, it is easier to refer to a stylistic pa- 
rameter by its name than to the set of linguistic features it 
represents. So below we say that a certain text is formal, 
when, in fact, we want o say that it has certain linguistic 
features uch as passives, formal words, conjuncts, etc. 
~ We are aware that some of those tasks can be subdivided 
and that some authors assume different names for2l~ 
same task. If necessary, we will do extensions tothis set. 
specific values of a stylistic parameter (ar- 
row C). 12 
Then we will observe the combinations of the 
NLG tasks in accordance with each text type 
(partition) obtained in the corpus analysis. This 
will give us an idea of which NLG tasks are most 
responsible for (the linguistic features associated 
with) the different ext types; also, it will show 
us how the tasks are working (because of the 
links to the linguistic features (see Figure 2)). 
The result of this process will be sets of NLG 
tasks for each text type.

rameter. 
Our work then will be to observe the NLG tasks 
(inside each text type first, but making cross- 
comparisons among text types afterwards) at- 
tacking the questions related to architecture, i.e., 
'which kind of modularisation and interaction 
between modules is necessary/appropriate', 
'which resources are used', 'what kind of data 
the modules/tasks exchange', etc. 
We will investigate architectural decisions at 
three different levels: 
• at the task level: how can a certain task be 
made sensitive to values of stylistic pa- 
rameters? 
• at the level o f  tasks interaction: is there a 
natural ordering of tasks for a certain type 
of text? 13 
• at the global level: assuming that tasks are 
normally encapsulated inside modules, 
what characteristics of texts force the in- 
teraction between modules to be more in- 
tense?

derived gives a measure of how important the linguistic 
feature isfor a certain stylistic parameter.

execution of tasks can favour a certain textual result over 
another. 
Proceedings ofEACL '99 
Faced with this classification we will propose 
solutions that can be used in the specification of 
an architecture that supports the generation of 
texts in different styles. We expect hese solu- 
tions to lead to useful guidelines for helping de- 
signers of NLG systems to choose the appropriate 
architecture for the type of text they want their 
system to generate. 
4 Discussion 
One may question why we are repeating Biber's 
experiment, when he has already obtained a set 
of stylistic parameters and a set of text types. It 
is possible that other results emerge from apply- 
ing his methodology to our corpus, and the only 
way to know this will be by re-doing the analy- 
sis. It is also possible that we obtain a subset of 
his results, which will at least make our task a 
more manageable one. 
We believe that our result will be of general 
utility. Although the precise set of stylistic pa- 
rameters may be dependent on the corpus one is 
using, we expect hat the set of valid task inter- 
action patterns will be restricted, and that the text 
types emerging from our study will encompass 
most of the valid patterns. Our programs for 
counting the linguistic features will be made 
available for others to use. 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper we propose a methodology for in- 
vestigating the relationship between architectures 
of NLG systems and stylistic properties of the 
texts they can generate. Although we are still 
undertaking the first steps of our methodology 
(the corpus analysis), we believe that this meth- 
odology will allow us to test the hypothesis re- 
garding the order of execution of NLG tasks, and 
at least provide initial indicators on the relation- 
ship between classes of architectures and the 
style of generated texts.
