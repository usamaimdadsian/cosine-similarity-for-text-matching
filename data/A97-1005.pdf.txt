ABSTRACT 
This paper presents a novel multimodal system applied to 
the setup and control of distributed interactive simulations. 
We have developed the QuickSet prototype, a pen/voice 
system running on a hand-held PC, communicating through 
a distributed agent architecture to NRaD's ~ LeatherNet 
system, adistributed interactive training simulator built for 
the US Marine Corps (USMC). The paper briefly describes 
the system and illustrates its use in multimodal simulation 
setup. 
KEYWORDS: multimodal interfaces, agent architecture, 
gesture recognition, speech recognition, natural language 
processing, distributed interactive simulation. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
In order to train personnel more effectively, the US military 
is developing large-scale distributed simulation capabilities. 
Begun as SIMNET in the 1980's \[23\], these distributed, 
interactive environments attempt to provide a high degree of 
fidelity in simulating combat, including simulations of the 
individual combatants, the equipment, entity movements, 
atmospheric effects, etc. There are four general phases of 
user interaction with these simulations: Creating entities, 
supplying their initial behavior, interacting with the entities 
during a running simulation, and reviewing the results. The 
present research concentrates on the first two of these 
stages. 
Our contribution to the distributed interactive simulation 
(DIS) effort is to rethink the nature of the user interaction. 
As with most modern simulators, DISs are controlled via 
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, the simulation 
GUI is showing signs of strain, since even for a small-scale 
scenario, it requires users to choose from hundreds of 
entities in order to select he desired ones to place on a map. 
To compound these interface problems, the military is 
intending to increase the scale of the simulations

Research Development Test and Evaluation (San Diego).

dramatically, while at the same time, for reasons of 
mobility and affordability, desiring that simulations hould 
be creatable from small devices (e.g., PDAs). This 
impending collision of trends for smaller screen size and for 
more entities requires a different paradigm for human- 
computer interaction. 
We have argued generically that GUI technologies offer 
advantages in allowing users to manipulate objects that are 
on the screen, in reminding users of their options, and in 
minimizing errors \[7\]. However, GUIs are often weak in 
supporting interactions with many objects, or objects not 
on the screen. In contrast, it was argued that linguistically- 
based interface technologies offer the potential to describe 
large sets of objects, which may not all be present on a 
screen, and can be used to create more complex behaviors 
through specification of rule invocation conditions. 
Simulation is one type of application for which these 
limitations of GUIs, as well as the strengths of natural 
language, specially spoken language, are apparent \[6\]. 
It has become clear, however, that speech-only interaction is
not optimal for spatial tasks. Using a high-fidelity 
"Wizard-of-Oz" methodology \[20\], recent empirical results 
demonstrate clear language processing and task performance 
advantages for multimodal (pen/voice) input over speech- 
only input for map-based systems \[17,18\]. 
3. QUICKSET 
To address these simulation interface problems, and 
motivated by the above results, we have developed 
QuickSet (see Figure 1) a collaborative, handheld, 
multimodal system for configuring military simulations 
based on LeatherNet \[5\], a system used in training platoon 
leaders and company commanders at the USMC base at 29 
Palms, California. LeatherNet simulations are created using 
the ModSAF simulator \[10\] and can be visualized in a 
CAVE-based virtual reality environment \[11, 26\] called 
CommandVu (see Figure 2 - -  QuickSet systems are on 
the soldiers' tables). In addition to LeatherNet, QuickSet is 
being used in a second effort called Exlnit (Exercise 
Initialization), that will enable users to create division-sized 
exercises. Because of the use of OAA, QuickSet can 
interoperate with agents from CommandTalk [14], which 
provides a speech-only interface to ModSAF. 
QuickSet runs on both desktop and hand-held PC's, 
communicating over wired and wireless LAN's, or modem 
links. The system combines peech and pen-based gesture 
input on multiple 3-1b hand-held PCs (Fujitsu Stylistic 
1000), which communicate via wireless LAN through the 
Open Agent Architecture (OAA) 2 [8], to ModSAF, and also 
to CommandVu. With this highly portable device, a user 
can create entities, establish "control measures" (e.g., 
objectives, checkpoints, etc.), draw and label various lines 
and areas, (e.g., landing zones) and give the entities 
behavior. 
agent-based architecture was chosen to support this 
application because it offers easy connection to legacy 
applications, and the ability to run the same set of software 
components in a variety of hardware configurations, ranging 
from stand-alone on the handheld PC, to distributed 
operation across numerous workstations and PCs. 
Additionally, the architecture supports mobility in that 
lighter weight agents can run on the handheld, while more 
computationally-intensive processing can be migrated 
elsewhere on the network. The agents may be written in 
any programming language (here, Quintus Prolog, Visual 
C++, Visual Basic, and Java), as long as they communicate 
via an interagent communication language. The 
configuration of agents used in the Quickset system is 
illustrated in Figure 3. A brief description of each agent 
follows: 
Figure 1: QuickSet running on a wireless handheld PC. 
In the remainder of the paper, we illustrate the system 
briefly, describe its components, and discuss its application. 
QuickSet interface: On the handheld PC is a get- 
referenced map of the region such that entities displayed on 
the map are registered to their positions on the actual 
terrain, and thereby to their positions on each of the various 
user interfaces connected to the simulation. The map 
interface agent provides the usual pan and zoom capabilities, 
multiple overlays, icons, etc. The user can draw directly on 
the map, in order to create points, lines, and areas. The user 
can create entities, give them behavior, and watch the 
simulation unfold from the handheld. When the pen is 
placed on the screen, the speech recognizer is activated, 
thereby allowing users to speak and gesture simultaneously. 
Speech recognition agent: The speech recognition 
agent used in QuickSet employs either IBM's VoiceType 
Application Factory or VoiceType 3.0 recognizers. The 
recognizers use an HMM-based continuous speaker- 
independent speech recognition technology for PC's under 
Windows 95/NT. Currently, the system has a vocabulary of 
450 words. It produces a single most likely interpretation 
of an utterance. 
Gesture recognition agent: OGI's gesture recognition 
agent processes all pen input from a PC screen or tablet. 
The agent weights the results of both HMM and neural net 
recognizers, producing a combined score for each of the 
possible recognition results. Currently, 45 gestures can be 
recognized, resulting in the creation of 21 military symbols, 
irregular shapes, and various types of lines.

4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
Architecturally, QuickSet uses distributed agent 
technologies based on the Open Agent Architecture for 
interoperation, information brokering and distribution. An 
z Open Agent Architecture is a trademark of SRI International. 
Natural language agent: The natural anguage agent 
currently employs a definite clause grammar and produces 
typed feature structures as a representation f the utterance 
meaning. Currently, for this task, the language consists of 
noun phrases that label entities, as well as a variety o f  
imperative constructs for supplying behavior. 
Muitimodal integration agent: The multimodal 
interpretation agent accepts typed feature structure meaning 
representations from the language and gesture recognition 
agents, and produces a unified multimodal interpretation.

5. EXAMPLE 
Holding QuickSet in hand, the user views a map from the 
ModSAF simulation, and with spoken language coupled 
with pen gestures, issues commands to ModSAF. In otter 
to create a unit in QuickSet, the user would hold the pen at 
the desired location and utter (for instance): "led T72 
platoon" resulting in a new platoon of the specified type 
being created at that location. 
Figure 3: A blackboard is used by a facilitator 
agent, who routes queries to appropriate agents for 
solution. 
Simulation agent: The simulation agent, developed 
primarily by SRI International, but modified by us for 
multimodal interaction, serves as the communication 
channel between the OAA-brokered agents and the ModSAF 
simulation system. This agent offers an API for ModSAF 
that other agents can use. 
Web display agent: The Web display agent can be used 
to create ntities, points, lines, and areas. It posts queries 
for updates to the state of the simulation via Java code that 
interacts with the blackboard and facilitator. The queries am 
routed to the running ModSAF simulation, and the 
available ntities can be viewed over a WWW connection 
using a suitable browser. 
Other user interfaces: When another user interface 
connected to the facilitator subscribes to and produces the 
same set of events as others, it immediately becomes part of 
a collaboration. One can view this as human-human 
collaboration mediated by the agent architecture, oras agent- 
agent collaboration. 
CommandVu agent: Since the CommandVu virtual 
reality system is an agent, the same multimodal interface on 
the handheld PC can be used to create entities and to fly the 
user through the 3-D terrain. For example, the user can ask 
"CommandVu, fly me to this platoon <gesture on the 
map>." 
Application bridge agent: The bridge agent 
generalizes the underlying applications' API to typed feature 
structures, thereby providing an interface to the various 
applications uch as ModSAF, CommandVu, and Exinit. 
This allows for a domain-independent integration 
architecture in which constraints on multimodal 
interpretation are stated in terms of higher-level constructs 
such as typed feature structures, greatly facilitating reuse. 
CORBA bridge agent: This agent converts OAA 
messages to CORBA IDL (Interface Definition Language) 
for the Exercise Initialization project. 
Figure 4: The QuickSet interface as the user 
establishes two platoons, a barbed-wire fence, a 
breached minefield, and then issues a command to one 
platoon to follow a traced route, 
The user then adds a barbed-wire fence to the simulation by 
drawing a line at the desired location while uttering '"oarbed 
wire." Similarly a fortified line is ~ .  A minefield of an 
amorphous hape is drawn and is labeled verbally, and 
finally an M1A1 platoon is created as above. Then the user 
can assign a task to the new platoon by saying "M1A1 
platoon follow this route" while drawing the route with the 
pen. The results of these commands are visible on the 
QuickSet screen, as seen in Figure 4, in the ModSAF 
simulation, and in the CommandVu 3D rendering of the 
scene. In addition to multimodal input, unimodal spoken 
language and gestural commands can be given at any time, 
depending on the user's task and preference. 
6. MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION 
Since any unimodal recognizer will make mistakes, the 
output of the gesture recognizer is not accepted as a simple 
unilateral decision. Instead the recognizer produces a set of 
probabilities, one for each possible interpretation of the 
gesture. The recognized entities, as well as the i r  
recognition probabilities, are sent to the facilitator, which 
forwards them to the multimodal interpretation agent. In 
combining the meanings of the gestural and spoken 
interpretations, we attempt o satisfy an important design 
consideration, amely that the communicative modalities 
should compensate for each other's weaknesses [7, 16]. 
This is accomplished by selecting the highest scoring 
unified interpretation of speech and gesture. Importantly, 
22 
the unified interpretation might not include the highest 
scoring gestural (or spoken language) interpretation because 
it might not be semantically compatible with the other 
mode. The key to this interpretation process is the use of a 
typed feature structure \[1, 3\] as a meaning representation 
language that is common to the natural language and 
gestural interpretation agents. Johnston et al. \[12\] present 
the details of multimodal integration of continuous peech 
and pen-based gesture, guided by research in users' 
multimodal integration and synchronization strategies \[19\]. 
Unlike many previous approaches tomultimodal integration 
(e.g, \[2, 9, 12, 15, 25\]) speech is not "in charge," in the 
sense of relegating esture a secondary and dependent role. 
This mutually-compensatory interpretation process is 
capable of analyzing multimodal constructions, as well as 
speech-only and pen-only constructions when they occur. 
Vo and Wood's system \[24\] is similar to the one reported 
here, though we believe the use of typed feature structures 
provides a more generally usable and formal integration 
mechanism than their frame-merging strategy. Cheyer and 
Julia \[4\] sketch a system based on Oviatt's \[17\] results and 
the OAA \[8\], but do not discuss the integration strategy nor 
multimodal compensation. 
7. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
QuickSet has been delivered to the US Navy (NRaD) and 
US Marine Corps. for use at 29 Palms, California, where it 
is primarily used to set up training scenarios and to control 
the virtual environment. It is also installed at NRaD's 
Command Center of the Future. The system was used by 
the US Army's 82nd Airborne Corps. at Ft. Bragg during 
the Royal Dragon Exercise. There, QuickSet was deployed 
in a tent, where it was subjected to an extreme noise 
environment, including explosions, low-flying jet aircraft, 
generators, and the like. Not surprisingly, spoken 
interaction with QuickSet was not feasible, although users 
gestured successfully. Instead, users wanted to gesture. 
Although we had provided amultimodal interface for use in 
less hostile conditions, nevertheless we needed to 
provide,and in fact have provided, a complete overlap in 
functionality, such that any task can be accomplished just 
with pen or just with speech when necessary. Finally, 
QuickSet is now being extended for use in the Exlnit 
simulation initialization system for DARPA's STOW-97 
Advanced Concept Demonstration that is intended for 
creation of division-sized exercises. 
Regarding the multimodal interface itself, QuickSet has 
undergone a "proactive" interface valuation in that the 
studies that were performed in advance of building the 
system predicted the utility of multimodal over unimodal 
speech as an input to map-based systems \[17, 18\]. In 
particular, it was discovered in this research that multimodal 
interaction generates simpler language than unimodal 
spoken commands to maps. For example, to create a 
"phase line" between two three-digit <x,y> grid coordinates, 
a user would have to say: "create a line from nine four three 
nine six one to nine five seven nine six eight and call it 
phase line green" \[14\]. In contrast, a QuickSet user would 
say "phase line green" while drawing a line. Creation of area 
features with unimodal speech would be more complex still, 
if not infeasible. Given that numerous difficult-to-process 
linguistic phenomena (such as utterance disfluencies) are 
known to be elevated in lengthy utterances, and also to be 
elevated when people speak locative constituents \[17, 18\], 
multimodal interaction that permits pen input to specify 
locations and that results in brevity offers the possibility of 
more robust recognition. 
Further development of QuickSet's poken, gestural, and 
multimodal integration capabilites are continuing. Research 
is also ongoing to examine and quantify the benefits of 
multimodal interaction in general, and our architecture in
particular.
