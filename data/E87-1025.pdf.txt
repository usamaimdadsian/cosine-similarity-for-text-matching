ABSTRACT 
Standard  D iscourse  Representat ion  Theory  
(DRT)  was  des igned main ly  to  exp la in  the  
so -ca l led  donkey-sentences .  The  pronouns  
p laY ing  such  a prominent  ro le  in  a l l  these  
sentences  be long ,  however ,  exc lus ive ly  to  
one  (par t l cu laP ly  s imple)  type  o f  p ronoun.  
We t ry  to  extend DRT in  o rder  to  cover  an  
equa l ly  Impor tant  type  o f  p ronoun,  the  
so -ca l led  e tdes0r Ip t lona l , *  p ronoun.  
D iscourse  re ferents  ape  now used  Eo car ry  
in fo rmat ion  on the  in tens lon  o f  the i r  
re ferents  as  we l l  as  on  the  extens lon .  
Th is  a l lows ,  a t  the  same t ime.  to  suggest  
access ib i l i ty  ru les  fo r  P ronouns  wh ich  are  
more  appropr ia te  than  those  suggested  by  
t rad i t iona l  DRT.  These  new ru les  ape  based  
on  the  gener lcness  o f  the  sentences  
invo lved .  
1. PRONOMINAL REFERENCE AS STARTING POINT 
fOR DISCOURSE REPRESENTATION THEORY 
One o f  the  s tar t ing  po in ts  fop  the  
deve lopment  o f  DRT in  Kamp*s  or lg lna l  
paper  (Kemp 1981)  was  the  seeming ly  
e r ra t i c  behav iour  shown by  indef in i te  noun 
phrases  under  a t rad i t iona l  log ica l  
ana lys i s ,  and the  equa l ly  e r ra t i c  in terac -  
t ions  that  seem to  obta in  between Indef ln -  
i re  noun phrases  and  in ter -sentent la l  and  
in tPa-sentent la l  PPonomlna l  re ferences  to  
them.  Of  Par t l cu laP  In teres~ was  the  
behav iour  o f  indef in i te  noun phrases  in  
the  so -ca l led  donkey-sentences .  
1.1 Def in i teness  and Indef in i teness  in  
T rad i t iona l  L ingu is t i c  Theory 
The t rad i t iona l ,  and  in tu i t ive ly  qu i te  
conv inc ing ,  v iew has  i t  that  de f in i te  noun 
phrases  re fer  to  an  ob jec t  that  is  a l ready  
fami l ia r  to  the  speaker  (and  poss ib ly  a l so  
to  the  l i s tener ) ,  whereas  indef in i te  noun 
phrases  in t roduce  new ob jects .  Th is  theory  
looks  conv inc ing  as  lone  as we cons ider  
exp l i c i t  de f ln i tes ,  as  in  
1) John owns a donkey. John beats  the Oon- 
key 
where  the  donkey  is  in t roduced as  ex ls t ln  s 
by  the  indef in i te  noun phrase  and  re fer red  
to  as  fami l ia r  by  the  fo l low ing  def in i te  
noun phrase .  Persona l  p ronouns  are ,  under  
the  accepted  In terpretat ion ,  cont racted  
fo rms o f  de f in i te  noun phrases ,  and  the  
fami l ia r i ty  hypothes is  o f ten  works  reason-  
ab ly  we l l  fop  them.  too:  In  the  fo l low ing  
paraphrase  o f  i: 
2) John owns a donkey. He beats  i t  
the  de f in i te  pronoun re fers  to  the  donkey  
wh ich  is  fami l ia r  a f te r  i t  has  been In t ro -  
duced  by  an  indef in i te  noun phrase ,  and  
the  def in i te  pronoun is. in  o ther  words .  
co - re ferent la l  w i th  the  pPeced lng  Indef ln -  
i re  noun Phrase .  For  th i s  reason  the  
t rad i t iona l  in terpretat ion  o f  noun phrases  
and pronouns  is  ca l led  " re ferent ia l " .  
But  p rob lems sur face  i f  we  cons ider  sen-  
tences  such  as  
3) John doesn ' t  own a donkey 
4) Every boy l i kes  h i s  mother 
Nei ther  does  the  indef in i te  noun phrase  in  
3 asser t  that  there  is  a donkey  that  John  
owns ,  nor  can  we rea l ly  say  that  the  pro -  
noun "h is "  in  ~ re fers  to  someth ing  fami -  
l i a r .  Indeed.  we  can  hard ly  se.v that  i t  
re fers  to  anyth ing  at  a l l :  I f  we  s t i ck  to  
the  t rad i t iona l  v iew o f  what  re ference  is, 
v iz .  a re la t ionsh ip  between an  express ion  
o f  language and  a rea l  ob jec t ,  then  there  
can  be  no  re ference  at  a l l  in  ~, s ince  no  
ex is tence  o f  any  boys  was  ever  asser ted .  
I t  was  examples  such  as  those  that  b rought  
the  whole  fami l ia r i ty  theory  in to  
d i s repute  (of. the  shor t  h is tor i ca l  
out l ine  g iven  by  Helm 1983) .  
1.2 Def in i teness  and Indef in i teness  in  
Log ica l l  7 Or iented L ingu is t i cs  
One rad ica l  so lu t ion  to  the  prob lem o f  
non- re fer r ing  noun phrases  was  suggested  
by Russe l l  in  h i s  c lass ica l  Theory  o f  
Descr ip t ions .  Zn it.  both  de f in i te  and  
indef in i te  a r t i c les  a re  in terpreted  as 
ex is tent ia l  quant l f le rs  (w i th  the  add l -  
148 
t iona l  const ra in t  o f  un iqueness  in  the  
case  o f  the  def in i te  a r t i c le ) .  Noun 
phrases  do  not  re fer  at  a l l .  they  a l l  
asser t  ex i s tence  (w i th  the  except ion  o f  
" log ica~ly  proper  names*', whose  ex is tence  
Russe l l  cou ld  never  prove) .  Example  3 
wou ld  become " I¢  i s  not  the  case  that  
there  is  a donRey  and  John  owns  i t" .  and  
wou ld  become "For  every  boy  there  i s  
exact ly  one  mother  such  that  he  loves  
her*'. Now the  t ru th  va lues  fo r  these  sen-  
fences  come out  r ight .  Th is  in terpretat ion  
is,  accord ing ly ,  ca l led  the  "quant i f l ca -  
t iona l  theory  o f  noun phrases" .  Under  ¢h ls  
ana lys i s  p ronouns  cor respond ¢o  the  var i -  
ab les  bound by  quant l f le rs  in  F i r s t  Order  
P red icate  Ca lcu lus .  
Unt i l  recent ly  most  l ingu is ts  and  log i -  
c ians  saw no  o ther  so lu t ion  to  the  prob-  
lems exempl i f ied  by  sentences  3 and  ~ than  
¢o  adopt  Russe l l ' s  theory .  But  the  quan-  
t l f l ca t iona l  theory  o f  noun phrases  does  
not  seem to  he lp  in  mul t i - sentence  
d i scourses  such  as  1 and  2 .  Here  the  t rad-  
i t iona l  re ferent ia l  theory  s t i l l  seemed to  
have  much more  exp lanatory  power .  But  th i s  
meant ,  un for tunate ly ,  that  noun phrases .  
inc lus ive  pronouns ,  must  be i n te rpreted  in  
(at  leas t )  two  fundamenta l ly  d i f fe rent  
ways :  In  s inE le  sentences  such  as  3 and  
as  quant i f ie rs  and  bound var iab les .  
respect ive ly ,  w i thout  any  re fer r ing  func -  
t ion ,  and  in  mul t i - sentence  d i scourses  
such  as  1 and  2 as  re fer r ing  express ions .  
But  fa r  worse ,  there  are  cer ta in  cases  
where  ne i ther  o f  these  in terpretat ions  
seems poss ib le .  The  best -known examples  
a re  the  so -ca l led  donkey-sentences :  
5) I f  John owns a donkey he i s  happy 
6) I f  John owns a donkey he beats  i t  
The most  natura l  t rans la t ion  o f  5 i s  
7) EXISTS X: (donkey(X) AND owns( john ,X) )  
->  happy( john)  
where  the  indef in i te  a r t i c le  can  be  
represented  as  an  ex is tent ia l  quant i f ie r .  
and  th l s  i s  in  Keep ing  w l th  our  in tu i t ion :  
A va l id  paraphrase  o f  th i s  sentence  is  " I f  
there  is  some donkey  that  John  owns  he  is  
happy'*. Example  6, on the  o ther  hand.  
must  get .  as  the  on ly  in tu i t i ve ly  conv inc -  
Ing  representat ion ,  
8) ALL X: ( (donkey(X)  AND owns( john ,X) )  -> 
beats ( john ,X) )  
where  the  indef in i te  a r t i c le  has  to  be  
t rans la ted  as  a un iversa l  quant i f ie r  ( "For  
any  donRey  that  John  owns  i t  w i l l  be  the  
case  that  he  beats  i t " ) .  The  on ly  syntac -  
t i c  d i f fe rence  between the  two sentences  
is  the  pronomina l  re ference  to  the  noun 
phrase  "a  donkey" ,  made in  6 but  miss lnE  
in 5. The  manner  in  wh ich  an arb i t ra r i l y  
( in  p r inc ip le )  fa r  removed pronoun in  the  
sur face  sentence  can  turn  an  ex is tent ia l  
quant i f ie r  in to  a un iversa l  one  has  been  
puzz l inE  log ic ians  and l i ngu is ts  fo r  a 
lone  t ime.  The  re ferent ia l  theory  o f  noun 
phrases  does  not  he lp ,  e i ther ,  in  these  
cases .  We rea l ly  a re  at  a loss  ¢o  exp la in  
donRey  sentences .  
But  there  are  yet  more  funct ions  o f  noun 
phrases ,  and  in  par t i cu la r  o f  p ronouns ,  
wh ich  seem to  res i s t  any  s t ra ight fo rward  
log ica l  o r  " t rad i t iona l ' *  in terpretat ion :  
The  Bach-Peters  sentences ,  where  pronouns  
po in t  c rosswise  fo rward  and  bacRward  ( "The  
p i lo t  who  shot  a t  i_~ h i t  the  MIE  that

pronouns ,  wh ich  po in t  f rom outs ide  in to

1.3 Pronominal  Reference  in  D iscourse  
Representat ion  Theory 
Kamp*s  DRT and  He lm's  F i le  Change Seman-  
t i cs  a re  two  (very  s imi la r )  a t tempts  ¢o  
un i fy  the  fami l ia r i ty /nove l ty  theory  and  
the  quant l f i ca t iona l  theory  o f  noun 
phrases  and,  as  spec ia l  cases ,  the  
re ferent ia l  theory  and  the  bound-var lab le  
theory  o f  p ronouns .  Both  authors  took  up  
an  idea  o f  Kar t tunen 's  (e .g .  Kar t tunen 
1976) .  v i z .  that  we  have  to  d l s t inEu ish  
between "normal"  re ferents ,  i .e .  rea l  
ob jec ts  in  the  wor ld  (o r  a mode l  o f  i t ) .  
and  spec ia l  d i scourse  re ferents  whose  
ex is tence  in  the  d i scourse  does  not  in  
i t se l f  say  anyth ing  about  the  ex is tence  o f  
any  ob jec ts  in  the  wor ld  (o r  the  mode l ) .  
Indef in i te  noun phrases  and  proper  names  
in t roduce  ( i .e .  asser t  the  ex is tence  o f )  
new d iscourse  re ferents .  These  d i scourse  
re ferents  const i tu te  the  un iverse  o f  
d i scourse .  The  remain ing  in fo rmat ion  con-  
ra ined  in  the  sentence  de f ines  the  cond i -  
t ions  on  the  d i scourse  re ferents .  Now the  
conf l i c t  between the  two in terpretat ions  
o f  noun phrases  can  be  reso lved:  We can  
"refer* '  (by  means  o f  de f in i te  noun phrases  
or  de f in i te  pronouns)  to  d i scourse  
re ferents  ( th i s  i s  the  re ference-  
fami l ia r i ty  component )  bur  these  ent i t ies  
a re  not  rea l  wor ld  ob jec ts  but  someth ing  
funct iona l ly  s imi la r  to  the  var iab les  used  
in  quant i f ied  s ta tements  ( th i s  i s  the  
quant i f i ca t ion  component ) .  Th ls  so lu t ion

denotat ion  o f  the  pronoun.  For  th i s  reason  
both  types  o f  anaphora  cons idered  so  fa r  
a re  usua l ly  ca l led  "denotat lona l  ana-

4.2 Descr ipt iona l  Anaphora 
~owever ,  there  i s  an  Impor tant  type  o f  
anaphora  that  does  not  fa l l  in to  th i s  
caTeEory .  15  and  16  are  two  examples ,  but  
we  w i l l  f i r s t  cons ider  a few s impler  
cases ,  namely  anaphora  w i th  indef in i te  
pronouns ,  i .e .  the  pronoun "one(s ) " .  
4.2.1 Indef in i te  Descr ipt iona l  Anaphora 
I n  both  o f  the  fo l low inE  examples ,  var i -  
ants  o f  the  c lass ica l  "paycheck-example" ,  
the  f i r s t  one  non-Eener lc  and  the  second 
one  Eener lc ,  
17) John published a paper in "Nature" in 
1986. Peter published one in "Science" 
18) A person who published a paper in 
"Nature" does not wr i te  one for  the "New 
Sc ient i s t "  
the  indef in i te  pronoun "one"  does  not  have  
the  same denotat ion ,  o r  extens ion ,  as  the  
noun phrase  i t  i s  anaphor ica l ly  l inked  To .  
We c lear ly  speak  about  two  d i f fe rent  
papers  (whether  they  be  ind iv idua l ly  
known,  as  in  17,  o r  taken  Eenera l ly ,  as  in  
18) .  In  DRT in  i t s  p resent  fo rm,  a s lnE le  
d i scourse  re ferent  wou ld  be  c reated  fo r  "a

i t  we  wou ld  Eet  the  wronE loE ica l  
in terpretat ion  (namely  the  one  we wou ld  
leE i t lmate ly  Eet  i f  the  pronoun were  
" i t "  ). 
We can  get  the  cor rec t  in terpretat ion  i f  
we  t reat  the  indef in i te  pronoun as  a 
"macro" ,  i .e .  as  an  abbrev ia t ion  fo r  par t  
o f  the  preced lnE  sentence .  Be fore  we 
actua l ly  in terpret  the  sentence ,  th i s  
abbrev ia t ion  must  be  "macro -expanded"  
(H i rs t ' s  express ion :  H i rs t  1981:31) .  i .e  
rep laced  by  a copy  o f  the  const ruct ion  i t  
anaphor ica l ly  Po in ts  to.  In  The  s imple  
examples  above  we can  actua l ly  copy  the  
sur face  s t ruc ture  f rom the  antecedent  in to  
the  p lace  o f  the  pronoun.  Th is  was  the  
exp lanat ion  or iE ina l ly  used  in  TPans forma-  
t lona l  Grammar  fo r  a l l  types  o f  p ronomina l

To  cons ider  cases  where  the  antecedent

macro -expanded to  an  "empty  she l l "  o f  the

inE  to  the  d i scourse  " John  pub l i shed  a

as  the  noun phrase  i t  anaphor lca l ly  po in ts

Th is  type  o f  anaphora  is  There fore  o f ten

There  is, however ,  a p rob lem To  cons ider  
that  d id  not  a r i se  w i th  denotat iona l  ana-  
phora .  I f  The  sentence  had  been " John  pub-

Th is  quest ion  w i l l  not  be  cons idered  here .  
The  on ly  th ine  we want  to  do  is  to  show 
that  a very  common Type  o f  anaphora .  
descr ip t iona l  anaphora ,  ca l l s  fo r  an

ind iv idua l ly  access ib le  b i t s  o f  In fo rma-

4.2 .2  Def in i te  Descr ip t iona l  Anaphora 
The Two examples  we s tar ted  w i th ,  15  and  
16. a re  acceptab le  because  they ,  too ,  a re  
descr ip t lona l .  But  They  are  de f in i te ,  as  
They  use  both  the  de f in i te  pronoun " i t " .  
Fur thermore .  both  o f  Them are  ~ener lc ,  and  
so  we cons ider  th i s  Type  o f  sentence  
f i r s t .  
AEa in ,  we  have  To  expand pronouns  in to  
newly  c reated  d i scourse  re ferents ,  and  
aEa in  we must  determine  what  in fo rmat ion  
has  to  be  packed  in to  these  new d iscourse  
re ferents .  But  now i t  i s  a b i t  c learer  
than  w i th  indef in i te  descr ipT iona l  ana-  
phora  how Th is  can  be accompl i shed .  In tu i -  
t i ve ly  i t  is  c lear  That  in  sentence  18, 
fo r  ins tance ,  the  two  ins tances  o f  "he"  
(p lus  one  wh ich  was  e l l ip t i ca l ly  de le ted :  
" . . .  and  he  w i l l  car ry  . . . " )  must  be  
expanded in to  th ree  d i f fe rent  d i scourse  
re ferents ,  cor respond inE  ¢o  "any  hunter  
who has  spot ted  a deer" ,  "any  hunter  who 
has  spot ted  and  k i l l ed  a deer" ,  and  "any  
hunter  who has  spot ted ,  k i l l ed  and  cut  up  
a deer" ,  respect ive ly .  Why do  we have  to  
use  these  success ive ly  more  compl ica ted  
express ions?  Because  o f  the  de f in i teness  
o f  the  pronoun.  
The  funct ion  o f  the  de f in i te  pronoun,  as  
opposed  to  the  indef in i te  one,  becomes  
c lear  i f  we  compare  example  16 w i th  18. In  
18 we ta lked  about  d i f fe rent  (at  leas t ,  
potent ia l l y  d i f fe rent )  papers .  In  16. how-  
ever ,  we  speak  about  one  s ing le  hunter ,  
a l thouEh in  d i f fe rent  sTaEes  o f  h i s  deer -  
k i l l i nE  ac t iv i t ies .  In  o ther  words ,  de f in -  
i te  p ronouns  requ i re  un iqueness  o f  the i r  
u l t imate  re ferent  in  the  same way  that  
de f in i te  noun phrases  do. In  the  case  o f  
denotaT iona l  p ronouns  in  non-~ener ic  sen-  
Tences  the  un iqueness  o f  the  constants .  
used  in  HCL  to  encode  ex is tent ia l  quant i f -  
i ca t ion ,  i t se l f  en forces  un iqueness  o f  The  
u l t imate  re ferents .  But  in  The  case  o f  
descr ipT iona l  anaphora  in  ~ener lc  sen-  
tences  i t  is  not  T r iv ia l  to  en force  th i s  
re ferent ia l  un iqueness .  As  each  Eener ic  
sentence  u l t imate ly  T rans la tes  in to  an  
independent  ru le  in  The  loE ica l  represen-  
ta t ion  we cannot  es tab l i sh  un iqueness  o f  a 
re ferent  named in  d i f fe rent  ru les  by  s im-  
p ly  us inE  the  same var iab le  name.  Th is  
becomes  qu i te  obv ious  i f  we  remember  That  
any  imp lementat ion  o f  a HCL  prover ,  such  
as  P ro loE ,  must  c reate  a new in terna l  
representat ion  fo r  the  same var iab le  name,  
when Th is  name is  used  in  d i f fe rent  
c lauses .  We can  never the less  en force  
un iqueness  o f  re ference ,  even  across  Een-  
e r i c  sentences  wh ich  map in to  separate  
c lauses ,  by  add inE  The consequences  o f  
each  preced lnE  c lause  to  The  cond i t ions  o f  
The  fo l low inE  one:  
k i l l s (H .D)  :-  hunter (H) ,  deer (D) ,  
spoCs(H.D) .  
cuts_up(H.D)  :- hunter (H) ,  deer (D) ,  
sPoCs(H.D) ,  k i l l s (H ,D) .  
car r ies_home(H,D) : -  hunter (H) ,  deer (D) ,  
spots (H ,D) ,  k i l l s (H ,D) ,  
cuts_up(H,D) .  
Thus  we not  on ly  see  why  examples  15  and  
16 are  poss ib le  but  a l so  how the  pronouns  
have  to  be  expanded.  
Def in i te  descr ip t iona l  anaphora  can  a l so  
occur  w i th  non-~ener ic  sentences .  In  
19) Here are the resu l t s  of the ana lyses  
fo r  samples 101 to  105. The resu l t  of the  
ana lys i s  fo r  sample 101 fo r  oxygen i s

20) I t  was pos i t i ve  las t  t ime 
21) I t  i s  pos i t i ve  fo r  n i t rogen  
22) I t  i s  pos i t i ve  fo r  sample 102 
the  pronoun " i t "  c lear ly  means  " the  resu l t  
o f  the  ana lys i s  fo r  sample  i01  fo r  oxyEen"  
 in  20, but  " the  resu l t  o f  the  ana lys i s  fo r  
152 
sample  i01"  in  21 and  "The  resu l t  o f  The  
ana lys i s  fo r  oxyEen" in  22. I f  we  concaten-  
a te  a l l  four  sentences  in to  one  d iscourse  
we have  to Eenerate  Three  d i f fe rent  
d i scourse  re ferents  fo r  these  noun 
phrases .  As  The  sentence  is  non-Eener ic  
They  wou ld  E ive  r i se  to  Three  d i f fe rent  
constants  in  The  loE ica l  representat ion  
( " resu lT l "  To  " resu l t3" ) .  That  These  se~-  
fences  rea l ly  a re  the  de f in i te  vers ion  o f  
descr lp t lona l  anaphoPa  can  a l so  be  seen  
f rom The  fac t  That  a va l id  paraphrase  o f

5. AN EXTENSION OF DISCOURSE REPRESENTA- 
TION THEORY 
I f  DRT is  To  cover  descr lp t lona l  anaphora  
(both  de f in i te  and  indef in i te ,  in  Eener ic  
as  we l l  as  in  non-Eener lc  sentences)  we  
have  To  pack  more  in fo rmat ion  in to  
d i scourse  re ferents  than  in  s tandard  DRT.  
In  add i t ion ,  we  w i l l  have  To exp la in  how 
Those  Types  o f  anaphora  That  rea l ly  a re  
imposs ib le  ( such  as  i~)  a re  b locked  wh i le  
Those  that  a re  poss ib le  a re  not .  F i r s t  we  
want  to  des iEn  d i scourse  re ferents  wh ich  
conta in  a l l  The  in fo rmat ion  necessary  fo r  
the  d i f fe rent  Types  o f  p ronomina l  ana-  
phora ,  and  Then we w i l l  sketch  some acces -  
s ib i l i ty  res t r i c t ions  on  Th is  backEround.  
5.1 The Functions of Discourse Referents 
in Revised Discourse Representation 
Theory 
What  k lnd  o f  in fo rmat ion  must  be  ava i l -  
ab le  in  a d i scourse  re ferent  To a l low The  
meso luT lon  o f  both  denoTaT iona l  and  
descr lpT iona l  anaphora9  Cons ider  example  
17 w i th  indef in i te  descr lpT iona l  anaphora .  
We want  a loE ica l  representat ion  o f  th i s  
d i scourse  To  look  l i ke  2 
evenT(c (1) ,pub l i sh ) .  
aEenT( John ,c (1 ) ) .

InsT(c (a ) ,papers ) .  
ob JecT(c (~) ,c (3 ) ) .

The  d i scourse  re ferent  we  in t roduce ,  fo r  
ins tance ,  fo r  The  noun phrase  "a  paper  )' 
must  a l low the  sys tem to  la ter  access  the  
constant  wh ich  was  c reated  in  The  loE ica l  
representat ion  To s tand  fo r  th i s  par t i cu -  
la r  paper  ( "c (2 ) " ) ,  in  The  case  we have  To  
reso lve  a denotat iona l  anaphora .  But  i t  
must  a l so  permi t  that ,  in  the  case  o f  
descr ip t lona l  anaphora ,  a copy  o f  i t se l f  
is made to  serve  as  new d iscourse  
re ferent ,  used  subsequent ly  To  c reate  a 
new ent ry  in  the  loE ica l  representat ion  
(e .E.  " ins t (c (h ) ,papers ) " ) .  The  d i scourse  
re ferent  shou ld  fu r thermore  car ry  in fo rma-  
T ion  about  The  Erammat lca l  Eender  and

fac i l i ta te  pronoun reso lu t ion  (e .g .  "m*s"  
fo r  "male  and  s ingu lar " ) .  A d i scourse  
re ferent  w l th  su f f i c ient  in fo rmat ion  cou ld  
have  a Eenera l  s t ruc ture  l ime that :  
"dr (U ,V ,X , I ,G÷N)" .  "U"  i s  The  un ique  iden-

%he d iscourse  var iab le  c reated  fo r  each  
newly  in t roduced d iscourse  re ferent ,  wh ich  
w i l l  Eet  bound To  the  extens ion  as  soon  as  
the  ent i re  sentence  is  T rans la ted  in to  
HCL .  Th is  te rm,  wh ich  is  common to  
d i scourse  re femenrs  and  Horn  C lauses  
c reated  by  Them,  is  d i rec t ly  access ib le

speak ,  The  l lnk  f rom The  d iscourse  leve l  
in to  the  lo~ica l  representat ion .  "G÷N"

have  To l i s t  Those  e lements  o f  a senten-  
t la l  component  wh ich  are  min imal ly  
requ i red  fo r  denotaT iona l  anaphora .  It  
tu rns  out  that  These  e lements  a re  a l l  
Those  o f  the  cond i t ions  on  a d i scourse  
re ferent  That  can  be  represented  as  unary  
pred icates  ( i .e .  ma in ly  nouns ,  ad jec t ives ,  
and  some in t rans i t i ve  verbs ) .  They  fo rm,  
ToEeTher ,  the  in tens ion  o f  The  phenomenon 
~epresented  by  the  d i scourse  re ferent .  
Th is  wou la  suEEest  The  te rm " in tens iona l

ra t iona l  anaphora"  so  far .  The  "X" ,  
f ina l ly ,  Te l l s  us  wh ich  var iab le  in  the  
inTens ion  cor responds  to  the  d i scourse  
var iab le  "V" ,  and  Thus  The  "X"  and  " I "  
toEether  cor respond To  " lambda X. (1)" ,  
app l i cab le  To  "V". For  The  noun phrase  
"a  paper"  th i s  wou ld  E ive  
"dP(3 ,V ,X ,  \ [ insT(X ,papers ) \ ] ,n÷s)" .  
The  DRS fo r  the  ent i re  example  17 Then

5.2 Access ib i l i ty  Rest r i c t ions  in  Revised 
D_!scourse Representat ion  Theory 
We noted  above  that  c lass ica l  DRT def ines  
access ib i l i ty  res t r i c t ions  wh ich  ru le  out  
some per fec t ly  leE i t lmate  examples ,  such  
as 15. We th ink  that  the  access ib i l i ty  
res t r i c t ions  that  rea l ly  ho ld ,  a re  the  
resu l t  o f  in teract ions  between the  Eener -  
I cness  o f  the  sentences  invo lved ,  and  the  
gener lcness  o f  a sentence  is  re f lec ted  
(amonE other  th lnEs)  in  the  type  o f  
d i scourse  re ferents  i t  Eenerates .  Example  
i~ s tar ts  out  w i th  a ~ener ic  s ta tement  and  
sudden ly  sw i tches  over  to  a non-~ener lc  
s ta tement  whereas  the  acceptab le  examples  
15 and  16 cons is t  o f  two  Eener lc  sen-  
fences .  I t  seems ¢o  be  th i s  sw i tch  o f  
Eener lcness  wh ich  makes  the  pronomina l  
re ference  imposs ib le  in  example  la, and  
not  the  fac t  that  we po in t  in to  a quant i -  
f i ed  sentence ,  s But  i t  i s  not  necessary  
that  the  sentences  concerned be lonE  to  the  
same Eener icness  cazeEorY .  The  f i r s t  o f  
the  fo l low inE  examples  is  unacceptab le  but  
the  second and  th i rd  examples  are  accept -  
ab le ,  desp i te  mixed  Eener lcness :  
23) * Whenever a farmer spots  a donke~ he 
abuses i t .  He i s  beat ing  and k ick ing  i t  
r ight  noN. 
24) Whenever Pedro spots  a donkey he 
abuses i t .  He i s  beat ing  and k ick ing  one 
r ight  noN. 
25) There i s  a farmer beat ing  and k ick ing  
a donkey. I ' ve  seen him before .  Whenever 
he spots  i t  he abuses i t .  
Th is  asymmetry  f inds  an  exp lanat ion  in  the  
fac t  that  non-Eener lc  sentences ,  such  as  
the  second sentence  o f  example  23, (a lmost  
a lways)  speak  about  ind iv idua ls .  A pronoun 
in  such  a sentehce  is  there fore  ( in  a lmost  
a l l  cases)  a denotat iona l  p ronoun,  t ry lnE  
to  f ind  an  extens iona l  va lue  in  an  
antecedent  wh ich  cou ld  be  used  as  i t s  own 
denotat ion .  Hence  we w i l l  have  to  make 
sure  that  a denotat lona l  p ronoun accepts  
on ly  representat ions  o f  ind iv idua ls  (o f  
the  fo rm "c (X)" )  in  the  preced lnE  
sentence(s ) ,  and  that  a fa i lu re  to  f ind  
them must  resu l t  in  the  ent i re  d i scourse  
becomlnE  unacceptab le .  Thus  the  "he"  and  
" i t "  in  the  second sentence  o f  example  23  
w i l l  t ry  to  f ind  ~epresentat ions  o f  ind i -  
v idua ls  in  the  f i r s t  sentence ,  but  there  
are  on ly  representat ions  o f  "s tereotypes" ,  
i .e .  meta - leve l  names  fo r  ob jec t  leve l  
var iab les  (o f  the  fo rm "v(X)" ) .  Th is  makes  
denotat lona l  anaphora  imposs ib le  in  th i s  
case .  
3. Bas ica l ly  the  same idea  was  deve loped 
by  Bar tsch  1979.  ¢houEh not  in  the  
f ramework  o f  DRT.  She  says  that  p ro -  
nouns  such  as  those  in  15  and  16 re fer  
to  s tereotypes  o f  ob jec ts  ra ther  than  
to  the  ob jec ts  themse lves .  However ,  
we  th ink  she  overs t re tches  th i s  idea  
by  c la imlnE  that  o rd inary  donkey-  
sentences  must  be  exp la ined  by  means  
o f  s tereotypes ,  a l so .  There  are ,  
a f te r  a l l ,  per fec t ly  non-Eener lc  
donkey-sentences ,  SUCh as "Every  
fa rmer  who bOUEh¢ a donkey  s lauEhtered  
154 
The same Prob lem does  not  a r i se  in example  
2~.  Here  we have  an exp l i c i t l y  descr lp -  
t lona l  p ronoun ( "one" ) ,  and  it w i l l  not  
care  about  the  type  o f  va lue  ~hat  i t s  
antecedent  has  ( i .e.  whether  it is "c (X)"  
oP  "v (X) ' ) ,  as it w i l l  on ly  use  the  
antecedent ts  in tens ion  anyway.  
Example  25, f ina l ly ,  is  acceptab le  because  
Eener lc  sentences  can  ta lk  about  e i ther  
ind iv idua ls  o__rr "s temeotypes" .  A l thoUEh the  
th i rd  sentence  ( "Whenever  he  spots  It  he  
abuses  i t . " )  is  Eener ic ,  the  Pmonouns  in 
it w i l l  f i r s t  t ry  to f ind  denotat ions  in  
the i r  antecedents .  In th i s  case,  they  w i l l  
succeed:  The  f i r s t  sentence  of  25 is non-  
Eener lc  and  has,  of  course ,  c reated  
repPesentat lons  o f  ind iv idua ls  ( i .e.  
"c(X)t'). Zf there  had  been  no su i tab le  
extens iona l  antecedents ,  the  P ronouns  
wou ld  have  s tar ted  look lnE  fo r  in tens iona l  
ones .  Th is  was  the  case  in examples  15 and  
16. In examples  19 to 22, f ina l ly ,  theme 
were  ac tua l ly  extens iona l  antecedent  
va lues ,  but praEmat lc  cons iderat ions  ( i .e.  
wor ld  knowledEe)  fo rces  the  hearer  in 
these  cases  to drop  the  ( fo rmal ly  poss i -  
b le )  denotat lona l  anaphora  in favour  o f  
(de f in i te )  descr lp t iona l  anaphora .  Jus t  
f lnd lnE  in tens iona l  antecedents  o f  
descr lp t lona l  p ronouns  is, however ,  not  
enouEh:  You  have  then  to dec ide  how much 
of  the  in tens ion  (o f ten  scat tered  over  
severa l  d i scourse  re ferents )  has  to be 
cop ied  in the  p lace  o f  the  pronoun.  But  
th i s  is an o ther  quest ion  a l together ,  
o f ten  invo lv lnE  in fe rences  over  wor ld  
knowledEe ,  p laus ib le  reason inE  e tc . ,  wh ich  
cannot  be  dea l t  w i th  heme.
