Preface 
The year 2000 marks the launch of the North American 
chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics 
(NAACL). The ACL Executive committee under the 
leadership of Phil Cohen used this as an opportunity to bring 
industry and researchers together to explore the full spectrum 
of computational linguistics and natural anguage processing 
by planning a joint conference, combining the 6th Applied 
Natural Language Processing Conference (ANLP) and the 
1st Conference of NAACL. ANLP-NAACL2000 marks not 
only the first major ACL sponsored conference of the new 
millennium, but reflects a significant change in the field, as 
we see speech and language applications leave the laboratory 
and enter every day use. 
The technical program covers all facets of the field, from 
theory and methodology to its application in commercial 
software. We chose to have two independent program chairs 
so that papers from each of these two perspectives could be 
evaluated independently and they appear in separate sections 
of the proceedings. Janyce Wiebe, New Mexico State 
University, was the NAACL Program Chair and Sergei 
Nirenburg, also from New Mexico State University, was the 
ANLP Program Chair. I would like to thank them and their 
program committees and teams of reviewers, whose hard 
work produced an exciting program with three parallel 
sessions, reflecting the breadth of quality research and 
application development being done throughout the world. 
We were honored to have as invited speakers two industry 
leaders: Dave Nagel, President, AT&T Laboratories and 
AT&T Chief Technical Officer, speaking on "Voice access 
to information", and Rick Rashid, Vice President, Microsoft 
Research, speaking on "The Future - It isn't what it used to 
be". From the academic ommunity, Leonard Talmy, State 
University of New York at Buffalo, an internationally 
recognized researcher in cognitive science, speaking on 
"How Language Structures Concepts". These plenary 
sessions have shown us how far the community has come in 
bringing speech and language to the marketplace and to 
remind us of the complexity of language and its relationship 
to human cognition. 
As is traditional at ACL conferences, the program goes 
beyond the presentation of technical papers and plenary 
sessions. There are also tutorials aimed at helping 
participants broaden their knowledge, workshops for 
exploring an area in depth, demonstrations to show the 
software implementations behind the theories, and exhibits to 
display the commercial products that have come out of the 
research, much of which was presented at past ACLs. I 
would like to thank the Tutorial Chair: Jennifer Chu Carroll 
(Lucent Technologies), Workshop Chair: Scott Miller 
(BBN), Demonstrations Chair: Jeff Reynar (Microsoft) and 
Exhibits Chair: Deborah Dahl (Unisys), all of whom 
composed quality programs. 
One of the most valuable aspects of ACL conferences i the 
opportunity it offers to students, who can get a broad 
perspective on the field and meet he people whose papers 
they read in their courses. They also have the opportunity 
to present heir own research, both in the main sessions 
and in special student sessions designed to help those in 
the early stages of their research. This year, we tried a 
new approach with a Student Research Workshop held 
before the conference with panelists to provide feedback 
to students, for which we received NSF funding from the 
Knowledge and Cognitive Systems Program under 
Ephraim Glinert. I would like to thank Committee 
members Donna Byron (University of Rochester) and 
Peter Vanderheyden (University of Waterloo), Co-Chairs, 
and Mary Harper (Purdue University), Faculty Advisor 
and NSF Principal Investigator and all of the reviewers 
who contributed to an excellent program and provided 
feedback to the students on their research. I would also 
like to thank the students who submitted papers and 
attended the workshop. They are the future of our 
organization. 
Rick Wojcik (Boeing) as Local Arrangements Chair took 
care of the myriad of arrangements that go into an event 
of this size. Kathy McCoy, Secretary-Treasurer of the 
ACL, and Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager, 
provided unending support in the planning, decision 
making, and execution of all of the arrangements. Mark 
Maybury (Mitre), Publicity Chair, expanded the number 
of places we advertise the conference to help widen our 
audience. June Santeusanio and Russell Kenyon from 
GTE created and updated a terrific web site, bringing the 
information about the conference to a central place. 
Russell developed the on-line registration form and 
provided support hroughout the registration process. 
I would especially like to thank Gary Coen (Boeing), who 
was the Sponsorship Chair, and all of the commercial 
companies who contributed to the conference. We had the 
largest level of industry support of any ACL conference 
in the past. Microsoft, Boeing, Sun, Intel (China), Xerox 
PARC, Logos, Conversa, and General Electric all 
contributed funds to support various events, allowing us 
to have a commercial grade conference at a hotel facility 
while keeping the conference fees at their usual level to 
accommodate academic budgets. GTE (BBN), 
Answerlogic, IBM, and Inxight provided scholarships to 
allow more students to attend the conference. 
There are many more people who deserve thanks for 
contributing in one way or another. ACL is an all 
volunteer organization and it is a credit to everyone who 
participates that we can put on an event of this size and 
scope, benefiting everyone who attends through the 
exchange of ideas and inspiration we get from seeing the 
leading edge of the field.

TUTORIALS  
Saturday 29 Apri l  2000, 8 :30AM-5:00PM 
Information Retrieval, 8:30AM-12:00PM 
James Allan, University of Massachusetts, Amherst 
This tutorial will examine the role of Natural Language Processing in Information Retrieval (IR). It will start with a 
historical overview of how NLP has been used and abused over the 40 years of IR research, attempting toillustrate 
why distrust of NLP was rampant in the IR community. We will next explore reasons that NLP might have been 
doomed to failure in early IR contexts--where basic IR techniques already captured some of what NLP might have 
offered, and NLP techniques with even small error rates were therefore unable to offer more. We will then focus on 
NLP/IR success tories--both past and present--that show how NLP can be (and has been) successfully used in some 
applications. The last portion of the tutorial will focus on very recent applications of NLP for retrieval and 
organization purposes. We will discuss the use of NLP and IR as part of Web applications, and as applied to Web 
pages. The tutorial will also include a discussion of the exciting Question and Answer track from TREC-8 (1999). 
That task results howed that a combination of IR and NLP was highly effective, creating agreat opportunity for 
future collaboration between the two fields. 
The State of the Art in Language Modeling, 8:30AM-12:00PM 
Joshua Goodman, Microsoft Research 
This tutorial will cover the state-of-the-art in language modeling. The goal of language models is to predict he 
probability of words; this is directly useful for speech recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, and 
other areas. Because language modeling is one of the most explored areas of statistical modeling, the state of the art 
is relatively advanced. Techniques from language modeling may be of interest to anyone pursuing probabilistic 
modeling, including those interested in statistical parsing, information retrieval, machine translation, and 
compression. The tutorial should be accessible to anyone with an elementary knowledge of probability. 
The most basic language models -- n-gram models -- essentially just count occurrences ofwords in training data. I 
will describe six improvements over this simple baseline: smoothing, caching, skipping, sentence-mixture models, 
clustering, and parsing-based models. 
1) Smoothing addresses the problem of data sparsity: there is rarely enough data to accurately estimate the 
parameters ofa language model. Smoothing ives a way to combine less specific, more accurate information with 
more specific, but noisier data. I will describe two classic techniques: deleted interpolation and Katz (or Good- 
Turing) smoothing, and one recent echnique, Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing, which is the best available. 
2) Caching is a widely used technique that uses the observation that recently observed words are likely to occur 
again. Models from recently observed ata can be combined with more general models to improve performance. 
3) Skipping models use the observation that even words that are not directly adjacent to the target word contain 
useful 
information. 
4) Sentence-mixture models use the observation that there are many different kinds of sentences. By modeling each 
sentence type separately, performance is improved. 
5) Clustering is one of the most useful anguage modeling techniques. Words can be grouped together into clusters 
through various automatic techniques; then the probability of a cluster can be predicted instead of the probability of 
the word. Clustering can be used to make smaller models or better performing ones. 
6) All of the previous techniques ignore the structure of language. Recently, Ciprian Chelba has shown that 
techniques from statistical parsing can be used for improved models. 
Finally, I will also talk about some practical aspects of language modeling. I will describe how freely available, off- 
the-shelf tools can be used to easily build language models, and how to use methods uch as count cutoffs to 
compress language models. 
xi 
Those who attend the tutorial should walk away with a broad understanding of the current echniques, and the 
background needed to either build their own language models, or to apply some of these techniques to other fields. 
Finite-State Morphology/Phonology:Theory,Applications,and Recent Developments, 
I:30PM-5:00PM 
George Kiraz, Lucent Technologies Bell Labs 
Morphology and phonology are crucial components in any large scale NLP and/or speech system. Finite-state (FS) 
approaches tomorphology/phonology are the state-of-the-art in he field; they aim at modeling the 
morphology/phonology f language with computational devices whose computational power does not exceed that 
of FS machines. Such machines are of interest because they are easy to implement, fast to run and mathematically 
elegant. The purpose of this tutorial is to give a comprehensive introduction to the field of computational 
morphology, with emphasis on recent developments and practical techniques to build real systems. 
The first hour of the tutorial will be introductory, bringing all the participants oa common understanding of the 
prerequisites involved: (1) morphology from a linguistics perspective, (2) automata theory from a computer-science 
perspective, and (3) how the two fields make up 'FS computational morphology'. 
The second hour will concentrate on the theory of FS morphology. The various popular formalisms and notations 
will be explained. Algorithms for compiling formalisms into FS machines (i.e., rule compilers) will be detailed with 
comprehensive step-by-step xamples. Algorithms for interpreting the formalisms directly will be outlined. Recent 
developments in the field will be emphasized. 
The third hour will concentrate on building practical applications. An introduction to the available tools (and how to 
build such tools) will be given. This will be followed by building simple grammars, moving to more complex 
grammars, including challenging morphological nd morphotactic phenomena (e.g., long-distance dependencies, 
heavy agglutinative morphology, reduplications, Semitic root-and-pattern, etc.). The tutorial will demonstrate how 
various linguistic descriptions of morphology and phonology (segmental, Autosegmental, prosodic, templatic, 
optimality theory, etc.) can be modeled with FS approaches. 
The tutorial will end with ~)pen Questions' detailing some of the issues that await research. 
Machine Translation, I:30PM-5:00PM 
Kevin Knight, USC/ISI 
Mechanical translation of one human language into another is one of the oldest applications of computer science, 
with roots going back to the 1940s and 1950s. It did not work very well then, and it does not work very well now. 
But, people use it all the time! MT programs can translate mail, web pages, and online chat; with human post 
editing, they can translate corporate and government documents. There has also been an explosion in the number of 
language pairs available. The major force that continues to drive machine translation research is the idea that if it 
did work, people would use it a lot more. MT also provides agauge of the breadth and depth of our scientific 
understanding of human language, including both interpretation a d generation aspects. 
This tutorial will cover a number of practical and theoretical topics. Most of the tutorial will consist of an in-depth 
look at several radically different types of MT systems. This will include both special-purpose and general-purpose 
MT. We will discuss how various MT systems are constructed, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. We 
will describe the workings of an interlingua-based system, and we will give a gentle yet rigorous description of a 
corpus-based statistical MT system. We will go through examples during the tutorial and also distribute small-scale 
(one-hour to eight-hour) assignments hat can be done after the tutorial. These assignments demonstrate basic 
principles without requiring extensive programming. 
We will also discuss the evaluation of MT systems, the economics of machine translation (including existing 
products and services), and the management of both source-language and target-language texts. This last topic 
includes ways of authoring documents o reduce ambiguity ("controlled language"), ways of preserving unresolved 
ambiguities in output ext, and issues concerning pre-editing and post-editing of documents. 
xii 
Finally, we will briefly discuss the future of MT, taking special account of current research in integrating MT with 
other natural language technologies (cross-language information retrieval, speech-to-speech translation, 
multilingual summarization, etc). We will also look at how current research in NLP is likely to affect MT in the 
future. 
Syllabus: 
1. Introduction to MT. Why is MT important? History of MT research and commercial development. General- 
purpose vs. special-purpose MT. Architectures that have been used for MT. 
2. Building MT Systems. Syntactic transfer: building a lexicon, transfer rules. Interlingua-based MT: domain- 
specific interlingua design, parsing, semantic interpretation, generation. Direct transfer: statistical lgorithms trained 
on bilingual corpora, text alignment, ransliteration, example-based MT. 
3. Managing the Input, Managing the Output. Pre-editing. Reducing ambiguity through controlled-language source 
text. Post-editing. Ambiguity preservation. 
4. Evaluation of MT Systems. Why it's hard. Metrics that have been proposed and used. Strengths and weaknesses. 
5. The Economics of MT. Products and services available. 
6. The Future of MT. Integrating MT with other natural language technologies: cross-language information 
retrieval, speech-to-speech MT, summarizing foreign-language documents. How current NLP research bears on 
MT.
