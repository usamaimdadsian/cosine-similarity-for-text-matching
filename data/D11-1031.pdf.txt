Abstract
Log-linear parsing models are often trained
by optimizing likelihood, but we would prefer
to optimise for a task-specific metric like F-
measure. Softmax-margin is a convex objec-
tive for such models that minimises a bound
on expected risk for a given loss function, but
its na?¨ve application requires the loss to de-
compose over the predicted structure, which
is not true of F-measure. We use softmax-
margin to optimise a log-linear CCG parser for
a variety of loss functions, and demonstrate
a novel dynamic programming algorithm that
enables us to use it with F-measure, lead-
ing to substantial gains in accuracy on CCG-
Bank. When we embed our loss-trained parser
into a larger model that includes supertagging
features incorporated via belief propagation,
we obtain further improvements and achieve
a labelled/unlabelled dependency F-measure
of 89.3%/94.0% on gold part-of-speech tags,
and 87.2%/92.8% on automatic part-of-speech
tags, the best reported results for this task.
1 Introduction
Parsing models based on Conditional Random
Fields (CRFs; Lafferty et al., 2001) have been very
successful (Clark and Curran, 2007; Finkel et al.,
2008). In practice, they are usually trained by max-
imising the conditional log-likelihood (CLL) of the
training data. However, it is widely appreciated that
optimizing for task-specific metrics often leads to
better performance on those tasks (Goodman, 1996;
Och, 2003).
An especially attractive means of accomplishing
this for CRFs is the softmax-margin (SMM) ob-
jective (Sha and Saul, 2006; Povey and Woodland,
2008; Gimpel and Smith, 2010a) (§2). In addition to
retaining a probabilistic interpretation and optimiz-
ing towards a loss function, it is also convex, mak-
ing it straightforward to optimise. Gimpel and Smith
(2010a) show that it can be easily implemented with
a simple change to standard likelihood-based train-
ing, provided that the loss function decomposes over
the predicted structure.
Unfortunately, the widely-used F-measure met-
ric does not decompose over parses. To solve this,
we introduce a novel dynamic programming algo-
rithm that enables us to compute the exact quanti-
ties needed under the softmax-margin objective us-
ing F-measure as a loss (§3). We experiment with
this and several other metrics, including precision,
recall, and decomposable approximations thereof.
Our ability to optimise towards exact metrics en-
ables us to verify the effectiveness of more effi-
cient approximations. We test the training proce-
dures on the state-of-the-art Combinatory Categorial
Grammar (CCG; Steedman 2000) parser of Clark
and Curran (2007), obtaining substantial improve-
ments under a variety of conditions. We then embed
this model into a more accurate model that incor-
porates additional supertagging features via loopy
belief propagation. The improvements are additive,
obtaining the best reported results on this task (§4).
2 Softmax-Margin Training
The softmax-margin objective modifies the standard
likelihood objective for CRF training by reweighting
333
each possible outcome of a training input according
to its risk, which is simply the loss incurred on a par-
ticular example. This is done by incorporating the
loss function directly into the linear scoring function
of an individual example.
Formally, we are given m training pairs
(x(1), y(1))...(x(m), y(m)), where each x(i) ? X is
drawn from the set of possible inputs, and each
y(i) ? Y(x(i)) is drawn from a set of possible
instance-specific outputs. We want to learn the K
parameters ? of a log-linear model, where each ?k ?
? is the weight of an associated feature hk(x, y).
Function f(x, y) maps input/output pairs to the vec-
tor h1(x, y)...hK(x, y), and our log-linear model as-
signs probabilities in the usual way.
p(y|x) = exp{?
Tf(x, y)}?
y??Y(x) exp{?Tf(x, y?)}
(1)
The conditional log-likelihood objective function is
given by Eq. 2 (Figure 1). Now consider a function
`(y, y?) that returns the loss incurred by choosing to
output y? when the correct output is y. The softmax-
margin objective simply modifies the unnormalised,
unexponentiated score ?Tf(x, y?) by adding `(y, y?)
to it. This yields the objective function (Eq. 3) and
gradient computation (Eq. 4) shown in Figure 1.
This straightforward extension has several desir-
able properties. In addition to having a probabilis-
tic interpretation, it is related to maximum margin
and minimum-risk frameworks, it can be shown to
minimise a bound on expected risk, and it is convex
(Gimpel and Smith, 2010b).
We can also see from Eq. 4 that the only differ-
ence from standard CLL training is that we must
compute feature expectations with respect to the
cost-augmented scoring function. As Gimpel and
Smith (2010a) discuss, if the loss function decom-
poses over the predicted structure, we can treat its
decomposed elements as unweighted features that
fire on the corresponding structures, and compute
expectations in the normal way. In the case of
our parser, where we compute expectations using
the inside-outside algorithm, a loss function decom-
poses if it decomposes over spans or productions of
a CKY chart.
3 Loss Functions for Parsing
Ideally, we would like to optimise our parser towards
a task-based evaluation. Our CCG parser is evalu-
ated on labeled, directed dependency recovery us-
ing F-measure (Clark and Hockenmaier, 2002). Un-
der this evaluation we will represent output y? and
ground truth y as variable-sized sets of dependen-
cies. We can then compute precision P (y, y?), recall
R(y, y?), and F-measure F1(y, y?).
P (y, y?) = |y ? y
?|
|y?| (5)
R(y, y?) = |y ? y
?|
|y| (6)
F1(y, y?) =
2PR
P +R =
2|y ? y?|
|y|+ |y?| (7)
These metrics are positively correlated with perfor-
mance – they are gain functions. To incorporate
them in the softmax-margin framework we reformu-
late them as loss functions by subtracting from one.
3.1 Computing F-Measure-Augmented
Expectations at the Sentence Level
Unfortunately, none of these metrics decompose
over parses. However, the individual statistics that
are used to compute them do decompose, a fact we
will exploit to devise an algorithm that computes the
necessary expectations. Note that since y is fixed,
F1 is a function of two integers: |y ? y?|, represent-
ing the number of correct dependencies in y?; and
|y?|, representing the total number of dependencies
in y?, which we will denote as n and d, respectively.1
Each pair ?n, d? leads to a different value of F1. Im-
portantly, both n and d decompose over parses.
The key idea will be to treat F1 as a non-local fea-
ture of the parse, dependent on values n and d.2 To
compute expectations we split each span in an oth-
erwise usual inside-outside computation by all pairs
?n, d? incident at that span.
Formally, our goal will be to compute expecta-
tions over the sentence a1...aL. In order to abstract
away from the particulars of CCG we present the al-
gorithm in relatively familiar terms as a variant of
1For numerator and denominator.
2This is essentially the same trick used in the oracle F-measure
algorithm of Huang (2008), and indeed our algorithm is a sum-
product variant of that max-product algorithm.

the classic inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979).
We use the notation a : A for lexical entries and
BC ? A to indicate that categories B and C com-
bine to form category A via forward or backward
composition or application.3 The weight of a rule
is denoted with w. The classic algorithm associates
inside score I(Ai,j) and outside score O(Ai,j) with
category A spanning sentence positions i through j,
computed via the following recursions.
I(Ai,i+1) =w(ai+1 : A)
I(Ai,j) =

O(Ci,k)I(Bj,k)w(AB ? C)+
?
k,B,C
O(Ck,j)I(Bk,i)w(BA? C)
The expectation of A spanning positions i through j
is then I(Ai,j)O(Ai,j)/I(GOAL).
Our algorithm extends these computations to
state-split itemsAi,j,n,d.4 Using functions n+(·) and
d+(·) to respectively represent the number of cor-
rect and total dependencies introduced by a parsing
action, we present our algorithm in Fig. 3. The fi-
nal inside equation and initial outside equation in-

desired expectations. A simple modification of the
goal equations enables us to optimise precision, re-
call or a weighted F-measure.
To analyze the complexity of this algorithm, we
must ask: how many pairs ?n, d? can be incident at
each span? A CCG parser does not necessarily re-
turn one dependency per word (see Figure 2 for an
example), so d is not necessarily equal to the sen-
tence length L as it might be in many dependency
parsers, though it is still bounded by O(L). How-
ever, this behavior is sufficiently uncommon that we
expect all parses of a sentence, good or bad, to have
close to L dependencies, and hence we expect the
range of d to be constant on average. Furthermore,
n will be bounded from below by zero and from
above by min(|y|, |y?|). Hence the set of all possi-
ble F-measures for all possible parses is bounded by
O(L2), but on average it should be closer to O(L).
Following McAllester (1999), we can see from in-
spection of the free variables in Fig. 3 that the algo-
rithm requires worst-case O(L7) and average-case
O(L5) time complexity, and worse-case O(L4) and
average-case O(L3) space complexity.
Note finally that while this algorithm computes
exact sentence-level expectations, it is approximate
at the corpus level, since F-measure does not decom-
pose over sentences. We give the extension to exact
corpus-level expectations in Appendix A.
3.2 Approximate Loss Functions
We will also consider approximate but more effi-
cient alternatives to our exact algorithms. The idea
is to use cost functions which only utilise statistics

Figure 2: Example of flexible dependency realisation in
CCG: Our parser (Clark and Curran, 2007) creates de-
pendencies arising from coordination once all conjuncts
are found and treats “and” as the syntactic head of coor-
dinations. The coordination rule (?) does not yet estab-
lish the dependency “and - pears” (dotted line); it is the
backward application (<) in the larger span, “apples and
pears”, that establishes it, together with “and - pears”.
CCG also deals with unbounded dependencies which po-
tentially lead to more dependencies than words (Steed-
man, 2000); in this example a unification mechanism cre-
ates the dependencies “likes - apples” and “likes - pears”
in the forward application (>). For further examples and
a more detailed explanation of the mechanism as used in
the C&C parser refer to Clark et al. (2002).
available within the current local structure, similar to
those used by Taskar et al. (2004) for tracking con-
stituent errors in a context-free parser. We design
three simple losses to approximate precision, recall
and F-measure on CCG dependency structures.
Let T (y) be the set of parsing actions required
to build parse y. Our decomposable approximation
to precision simply counts the number of incorrect
dependencies using the local dependency counts,
n+(·) and d+(·).
DecP (y) =
?
t?T (y)
d+(t)? n+(t) (8)
To compute our approximation to recall we require
the number of gold dependencies, c+(·), which
should have been introduced by a particular parsing
action. A gold dependency is due to be recovered
by a parsing action if its head lies within one child
span and its dependent within the other. This yields a
decomposed approximation to recall that counts the
number of missed dependencies.
DecR(y) =
?
t?T (y)
c+(t)? n+(t) (9)
336
Unfortunately, the flexible handling of dependencies
in CCG complicates our formulation of c+, render-
ing it slightly more approximate. The unification
mechanism of CCG sometimes causes dependencies
to be realised later in the derivation, at a point when
both the head and the dependent are in the same
span, violating the assumption used to compute c+
(see again Figure 2). Exceptions like this can cause
mismatches between n+ and c+. We set c+ = n+
whenever c+ < n+ to account for these occasional
discrepancies.
Finally, we obtain a decomposable approximation
to F-measure.
DecF1(y) = DecP (y) +DecR(y) (10)
4 Experiments
Parsing Strategy. CCG parsers use a pipeline strat-
egy: we first multitag each word of the sentence with
a small subset of its possible lexical categories us-
ing a supertagger, a sequence model over these cat-
egories (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999; Clark, 2002).
Then we parse the sentence under the requirement
that the lexical categories are fixed to those preferred
by the supertagger. In our experiments we used two
variants on this strategy.
First is the adaptive supertagging (AST) approach
of Clark and Curran (2004). It is based on a step
function over supertagger beam widths, relaxing the
pruning threshold for lexical categories only if the
parser fails to find an analysis. The process either
succeeds and returns a parse after some iteration or
gives up after a predefined number of iterations. As
Clark and Curran (2004) show, most sentences can
be parsed with very tight beams.
Reverse adaptive supertagging is a much less ag-
gressive method that seeks only to make sentences
parsable when they otherwise would not be due to an
impractically large search space. Reverse AST starts
with a wide beam, narrowing it at each iteration only
if a maximum chart size is exceeded. Table 1 shows
beam settings for both strategies.
Adaptive supertagging aims for speed via pruning
while the reverse strategy aims for accuracy by ex-
posing the parser to a larger search space. Although
Clark and Curran (2007) found no actual improve-
ments from the latter strategy, we will show that
with our softmax-margin-trained models it can have
a substantial effect.
Parser. We use the C&C parser (Clark and Cur-
ran, 2007) and its supertagger (Clark, 2002). Our
baseline is the hybrid model of Clark and Curran
(2007), which contains features over both normal-
form derivations and CCG dependencies. The parser
relies solely on the supertagger for pruning, using
exact CKY for search over the pruned space. Train-
ing requires calculation of feature expectations over
packed charts of derivations. For training, we lim-
ited the number of items in this chart to 0.3 million,
and for testing, 1 million. We also used a more per-
missive training supertagger beam (Table 2) than in
previous work (Clark and Curran, 2007). Models
were trained with the parser’s L-BFGS trainer.
Evaluation. We evaluated on CCGbank (Hocken-
maier and Steedman, 2007), a right-most normal-
form CCG version of the Penn Treebank. We use
sections 02-21 (39603 sentences) for training, sec-
tion 00 (1913 sentences) for development and sec-
tion 23 (2407 sentences) for testing. We supply
gold-standard part-of-speech tags to the parsers. We
evaluate on labelled and unlabelled predicate argu-
ment structure recovery and supertag accuracy.
4.1 Training with Maximum F-measure Parses
So far we discussed how to optimise towards task-
specific metrics via changing the training objective.
In our first experiment we change the data on which
we optimise CLL. This is a kind of simple base-
line to our later experiments, attempting to achieve
the same effect by simpler means. Specifically, we
use the algorithm of Huang (2008) to generate or-
acle F-measure parses for each sentence. Updating
towards these oracle parses corrects the reachabil-
ity problem in standard CLL training. Since the su-
pertagger is used to prune the training forests, the
correct parse is sometimes pruned away – reducing
data utilisation to 91%. Clark and Curran (2007)
correct for this by adding the gold tags to the parser
input. While this increases data utilisation, it bi-
ases the model by training in an idealised setting not
available at test time. Using oracle parses corrects
this bias while permitting 99% data utilisation. The
labelled F-score of the oracle parses lies at 98.1%.
Though we expected that this might result in some
improvement, results (Table 3) show that this has no

effect. However, it does serve as a useful baseline.
4.2 Training with the Exact Algorithm
We first tested our assumptions about the feasibil-
ity of training with our exact algorithm by measur-
ing the amount of state-splitting. Figure 4 plots the
average number of splits per span against the rela-
tive span-frequency; this is based on a typical set of
training forests containing over 600 million states.
The number of splits increases exponentially with
span size but equally so decreases the number of
spans with many splits. Hence the small number of
states with a high number of splits is balanced by a
large number of spans with only a few splits: The
highest number of splits per span observed with our
settings was 4888 but we find that the average num-
ber of splits lies at 44. Encouragingly, this enables
experimentation in all but very large scale settings.

across all split-states in the training corpus; since

number of all recovered dependencies, is precision,
the graph shows that only a minority of states have
either very high or very low precision. The range
of values suggests that the softmax-margin criterion
338
will have an opportunity to substantially modify the
expectations, hopefully to good effect.

We next turn to the question of optimization with
these algorithms. Due to the significant computa-
tional requirements, we used the computationally
less intensive normal-form model of Clark and Cur-
ran (2007) as well as their more restrictive training
beam settings (Table 2). We train on all sentences of
the training set as above and test with AST.
In order to provide greater control over the influ-
ence of the loss function, we introduce a multiplier
? , which simply amends the second term of the ob-
jective function (3) to:
log
?
y?Y (xi)
exp{?T f(xi, y) + ? × `(yi, y)}
Figure 6 plots performance of the exact loss func-
tions across different settings of ? on various evalu-
ation criteria, for models restricted to at most 3000
items per chart at training time to allow rapid ex-
perimentation with a wide parameter set. Even in
this constrained setting, it is encouraging to see that
each loss function performs best on the criteria it op-
timises. The precision-trained parser also does very
well on F-measure; this is because the parser has a
tendency to perform better in terms of precision than
recall.
4.3 Exact vs. Approximate Loss Functions
With these results in mind, we conducted a compar-
ison of parsers trained using our exact and approxi-
mate loss functions. Table 4 compares their perfor-
mance head to head when restricting training chart
sizes to 100,000 items per sentence, the largest set-
ting our computing resources allowed us to experi-
ment with. The results confirm that the loss-trained
models improve over a likelihood-trained baseline,
and furthermore that the exact loss functions seem
to have the best performance. However, the approx-
imations are extremely competitive with their exact
counterparts. Because they are also efficient, this
makes them attractive for larger-scale experiments.
Training time increases by an order of magnitude
with exact loss functions despite increased theoreti-
cal complexity (§3.1); there is no significant change
with approximate loss functions.
Table 5 shows performance of the approximate
losses with the large scale settings initially outlined
(§4). One striking result is that the softmax-margin
trained models coax more accurate parses from the
larger search space, in contrast to the likelihood-
trained models. Our best loss model improves the
labelled F-measure by over 0.8%.
4.4 Combination with Integrated Parsing and
Supertagging
As a final experiment, we embed our loss-trained
model into an integrated model that incorporates
Markov features over supertags into the parsing
model (Auli and Lopez, 2011). These features have
serious implications on search: even allowing for the
observation of Fowler and Penn (2010) that our CCG
is weakly context-free, the search problem is equiva-
lent to finding the optimal derivation in the weighted
intersection of a regular and context-free language
(Bar-Hillel et al., 1964), making search very expen-
sive. Therefore parsing with this model requires ap-
proximations.
To experiment with this combined model we use

tion over supertag variables defined by a supertag-
ging model, and the other is a distribution over these
variables and a set of span variables defined by our
parsing model.5 The factors communicate by pass-
ing messages across the shared supertag variables
that correspond to their marginal distributions over
those variables. Hence, to compute approximate ex-
pectations across the entire model, we run forward-
backward to obtain posterior supertag assignments.
These marginals are passed as inside values to the
inside-outside algorithm, which returns a new set
of posteriors. The new posteriors are incorporated
into a new iteration of forward-backward, and the
algorithm iterates until convergence, or until a fixed
number of iterations is reached – we found that a
single iteration is sufficient, corresponding to a trun-
cated version of the algorithm in which posteriors
are simply passed from the supertagger to the parser.
To decode, we use the posteriors in a minimum-risk
parsing algorithm (Goodman, 1996).
Our baseline models are trained separately as be-
fore and combined at test time. For softmax-margin,
we combine a parsing model trained with F1 and
a supertagger trained with Hamming loss. Table 6
shows the results: we observe a gain of up to 1.5%
in labelled F1 and 0.9% in unlabelled F1 on the test
set. The loss functions prove their robustness by im-
proving the more accurate combined models up to
0.4% in labelled F1. Table 7 shows results with au-
tomatic part-of-speech tags and a direct comparison
with the Petrov parser trained on CCGbank (Fowler
and Penn, 2010) which we outpeform on all metrics.
5These complex factors resemble those of Smith and Eisner
(2008) and Dreyer and Eisner (2009); they can be thought of
as case-factor diagrams (McAllester et al., 2008)
5 Conclusion and Future Work
The softmax-margin criterion is a simple and effec-
tive approach to training log-linear parsers. We have
shown that it is possible to compute exact sentence-
level losses under standard parsing metrics, not only
approximations (Taskar et al., 2004). This enables
us to show the effectiveness of these approxima-
tions, and it turns out that they are excellent sub-
stitutes for exact loss functions. Indeed, the approxi-
mate losses are as easy to use as standard conditional
log-likelihood.
Empirically, softmax-margin training improves
parsing performance across the board, beating the
state-of-the-art CCG parsing model of Clark and
Curran (2007) by up to 0.8% labelled F-measure.
It also proves robust, improving a stronger base-
line based on a combined parsing and supertagging
model. Our final result of 89.3%/94.0% labelled
and unlabelled F-measure is the best result reported
for CCG parsing accuracy, beating the original C&C
baseline by up to 1.5%.
In future work we plan to scale our exact loss
functions to larger settings and to explore training
with loss functions within loopy belief propagation.
Although we have focused on CCG parsing in this
work, we expect our methods to be equally appli-
cable to parsing with other grammar formalisms in-
cluding context-free grammar or LTAG.

A Computing F-Measure-Augmented
Expectations at the Corpus Level
To compute exact corpus-level expectations for softmax-
margin using F-measure, we add an additional transition
before reaching the GOAL item in our original program.
To reach it, we must parse every sentence in the corpus,
associating statistics of aggregate ?n, d? pairs for the en-
tire training set in intermediate symbols ?(1)...?(m) with
the following inside recursions.
I(?(1)n,d) = I(S
(1)
0,|x(1)|,n,d)
I(?(`)n,d) =
?
n?,n??:n?+n??=n
I(?(`?1)n?,d? )I(S
(`)
0,N,n??,d??)
I(GOAL) =
?
n,d
I(?(m)n,d )
(
1? 2nd+ |y|
)
Outside recursions follow straightforwardly. Implemen-
tation of this algorithm would require substantial dis-
tributed computation or external data structures, so we
did not attempt it.
