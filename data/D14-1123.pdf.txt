Abstract
Microblog has become a major plat-
form for information about real-world
events. Automatically discovering real-
world events from microblog has attracted
the attention of many researchers. Howev-
er, most of existing work ignore the impor-
tance of emotion information for event de-
tection. We argue that people’s emotion-
al reactions immediately reflect the occur-
ring of real-world events and should be im-
portant for event detection. In this study,
we focus on the problem of community-
related event detection by community e-
motions. To address the problem, we pro-
pose a novel framework which include
the following three key components: mi-
croblog emotion classification, community
emotion aggregation and community emo-
tion burst detection. We evaluate our ap-
proach on real microblog data sets. Exper-
imental results demonstrate the effective-
ness of the proposed framework.
1 Introduction
Microblog has become a popular and convenient
platform for people to share information about so-
cial events in real time. When an external even-
t occurs, it will be quickly propagated between
microblog users. During propagation process of
an event, sufficient amount of users will express
their emotions. Taking Sina Weibo
1
as an exam-
ple, more than 12 percent of users use emoticons
2
when reposting an event-related microblog mes-
sage.
The emotion information can not only help us
better understand a given event, but also be u-
tilized to discover new events. Figure 1 shows

Day (in March 2011)
Happy Anger
Sad Fear
Figure 1: The global emotion dynamics
the emotional distribution dynamics of the over-
all microblog messages in March 2011. The
sudden change of the public emotion distribu-
tion on March 12 indicates a public event: 3.11
Earthquake in Japan. We can see that emotional
changes immediately reflect the occurring of real-
world events, thus it is reasonable to use them to
perform event detection.
Most existing research on microblog event de-
tection (Weng and Lee, 2011; Sakaki et al., 2010;
Becker et al., 2010) only account for the factu-
al information (e.g., burstness of topic keyword-
s). They usually ignore the importance of emo-
tion information for event detection. Although
there have recently been a few papers (Zhao et al.,
2012a; Nguyen et al., 2013; Akcora et al., 2010)
in this direction, they have a number of disad-
vantages. Firstly, they can not detect community-
related events. Since they all aggregate emotion
at global level, they can only discover national at-
tention events, such as public holidays ( “Christ-
mas” and “Spring Festival”) or natural disasters.
In many applications, discovering events related
to a certain group of users or a certain topic is
more meaningful. Consider the following ques-
tions: “what happened in the football communi-
ty last week?” and “what are the most significant
events in the lawyer community last month?” Sec-
ondly, they assign equal weight to each microblog
message or user when aggregating them to a glob-
al emotion score. Such approaches may lead to
incorrect results when a user posts emotion spam
1159
in the community. Thirdly, there is a lack of quan-
titative evaluation using real-world events in exist-
ing work. For example, there is only case study in
(Zhao et al., 2012a) and (Akcora et al., 2010).
In this study, we focus on a new task of de-
tecting community-related events via community
emotion. Our intuition is inspired from the so-
cial psychology theory of group emotion. In social
psychology, group emotion refers to the moods,
emotions and dispositional affects of a group of
people
3
. It can arise as a result of group-relevant
events (Smith et al., 2007). For example, people
will feel happy when their favorite football team
wins a game and feel sad when their team loses
a game. Thus we can use the community emo-
tion as signals to detect community-related events.
To achieve good performance of this new task, the
following two factors must be considered: 1) how
to measure the community emotion based on mi-
croblog message or user emotion and 2) how to
perform event detection based on the sequence of
community emotion.
To measure community emotion, we argue that
in a given community, different users have differ-
ent emotional authorities. The emotion of highly
influential people in the community may be more
important in determining the community emotion
(Bars¨ade and Gibson, 1998). We propose to use
the user’s emotion authority computed by the so-
cial network of the community to weight the us-
er when aggregating community emotion. Since
spam user is unlikely to have high emotion au-
thority in the community, our method can reduce
the effect of emotion spam. Based on the com-
munity emotion, we present an emotion burst de-
tection algorithm for the community emotion dis-
tribution sequence. We identify two emotional s-
tates of the community: “emotion stable” state and
“emotion burst” state. We use the Dirichlet dis-
tribution to model the generation process of the
community emotion distribution. An efficient e-
motion burst detection algorithm is presented to
detect community-related events.
We evaluate our approach on large-scale mi-
croblog data sets by using real-world event list
for each community. Experimental results demon-
strate that the community emotion is an effective
signal for community-related event detection. In
comparison with several baseline methods, our e-
motion burst detection algorithm also improves
3
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group emotion
the event detection performance in terms of pre-
cision, recall and F-measure.
2 Related Work
In this section, we review the related work on sen-
timent analysis and event detection in microblog,
respectively.
Sentiment Analysis in Microblog: Sentiment
analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008; Liu, 2012) is main-
ly about analyzing people’s opinions, sentiments
and emotions towards a given event, topic, produc-
t, etc. Microblog platforms like Twitter and Wei-
bo, provide people a convenient way to post their
emotional reactions towards social events in al-
most real time. This leads to increasing number
of interests on sentiment analysis in microblog da-
ta (Davidov et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Go et
al., 2009; Agarwal et al., 2011; Pak and Paroubek,
2010; Jiang et al., 2011; Speriosu et al., 2011;
Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010). The training
data for microblog sentiment analysis are usual-
ly obtained in an automatic manner by utilizing
emoticons, hashtags and smileys. Davidov et al.
(2010) propose an approach to automatically ob-
tain labeled training examples by exploiting hash-
tags and smileys. Liu et al. (2012) proposed an e-
moticon smoothed method to integrate both manu-
ally labeled data and noisy labeled data for Twitter
sentiment classification.
Different from existing microblog sentimen-
t analysis work, which aims at discovering senti-
ments and emotions for an event or topic given in
advance, we are interested in utilizing the emotion
information in microblog messages for real-world
event detection. Our work use sentiment analysis
as a tool to perform microblog emotion classifi-
cation. Then we propose an event detection algo-
rithm based on the sequence of community level
emotion distribution.
Event Detection in Microblog: Event detec-
tion from microblog data has attracted increas-
ing attention recently. We divide existing work
into the following two categories: non-emotion-
based methods and emotion-based methods. Non-
emotion-based methods try to exploit keyword or
activity patterns to discover events (Weng and Lee,
2011; Sakaki et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2010;
Mathioudakis and Koudas, 2010). Mathioudakis
and Koudas (2010) first identify “bursty” key-
words and then discover events by grouping bursty
keywords together. Zhao et al. (2012b) focuses on
1160
identifying event-related burst from social media
based on multiple activities. They propose a uni-
fied optimization model to integrate multiple cor-
related activity streams based on the state machine
in (Kleinberg, 2003).
Emotion-based methods try to exploit the emo-
tional reactions to discover events (Zhao et al.,
2012a; Akcora et al., 2010). Akcora et al. (2010)
model public emotion as an emotion vector com-
puted by counting emotion words and then use a
rule-based method to identify public breakpoints.
Zhao et al. (2012a) use a simple top-k method to
detect abnormal events based on sequence of sen-
timent variance.
Our method is also an emotion-based method.
However, our approach is different from existing
emotion-based methods in the following aspect-
s. Firstly, while existing work aggregates emotion
for all users, we focus on emotion for a certain
community to discover community-related events.
Secondly, existing methods assume that the emo-
tions of different users are of equal importance.
We distinguish user’s emotional authority based
on the community structure of users.
3 Preliminary Definitions
In this section, we first give some basic concepts
before formally defining our problem.
Topical Community: A group of connected
users that are interested in a specific topic. A topi-
cal community can be denoted asC = {V,E,M},
where V is the set of community users, E is
the set of relationships of between users. M =
{M
1
,M
2
, ...,M
T
} is the microblog message col-
lection in the community, which is segmented ac-
cording to time. M
t
is the microblog message col-
lection in time interval t.
Emotion Distribution: An emotion distribu-
tion e
t
is a real-valueN -dimension vector sampled
from the emotion space, satisfying the constraint
?
N
i=1
e
ti
= 1. It indicates the emotional state of a
microblog message, a user or a community at time
t. At a given time interval t, a user emotion distri-
bution e
t
(u) is computed by an aggregation func-
tion over the emotion distribution of the microblog
messages posted by u in time interval t. Commu-
nity emotion distribution e
t
(c) is computed by an
aggregation function over the emotion distribution
of the community users in c at time interval t.
Community Emotion Burst: Given an emo-
tion distribution sequence e
t
for community c, an
emotion burst is defined as period [t
s
, t
e
] in which
some event relevant to c takes places. During the
time period, the emotion distribution of c is :1) sig-
nificantly different from its average emotion distri-
bution, or 2) extremely uneven distributed.
Given the above definitions, our object is then to
detect community-related events from the emotion
distribution sequence of the community.
4 The Proposed Framework
In this section, we describe our microblog event
detection framework. The framework aims to de-
tect community-related events based on the com-
munity emotion. The overview of our framework
is shown in Figure 2. In particular, we define the
following four main components:
1) Microblog emotion classification: We train
emotion classification model by automatically ac-
quiring training data using the emoticons.
2) Community emotion aggregation: We as-
sume that in a given community, different users
have different weights when aggregating commu-
nity emotion. Thus we propose a novel weighting
approach based on the user’s authority.
3) Community emotion burst detection: Giv-
en the community emotion, we propose an emo-
tion burst detection algorithm to detect community
emotion bursts.
4) Event extraction: The function of this com-
ponent is to extract event keywords for each com-
munity emotion burst. We count the document
frequency (DF) of each term contained in the mi-
croblog messages in the burst period. Then the
top-5 DF terms are used to describe the event oc-
curring during the burst period, although there ex-
ist alternative techniques (Ritter et al., 2012; Li et
al., 2010).
Since the last component is not the main focus
of this work, we only introduce the first three com-
ponents in detail in the following subsections.
4.1 Microblog Emotion Classification
We build an emotion classifier using the multino-
mial Na¨?ve Bayes classifier for each community
to classify microblog messages into different emo-
tion classes. Here we are interested in the setting
where the microblog messages arrive as stream,
thus it is not appropriate to use a constant set of
manually labeled messages. To avoid manual an-
notation cost, we adopt a distant supervision ap-
proach (Go et al., 2009; Davidov et al., 2010; Hu

Sad(13)

Fear(11)
fear surprise shame doubt fright
et al., 2013) to acquire labeled microblog mes-
sages automatically by using the emoticons. We
first select a set of emoticons which are most fre-
quently used to express emotion in microblog.
Then we manually map each emoticon into four
emotion classes (26 for happy, 19 for anger, 13
for sad and 11 for fear). We only show the top
five emoticons for each emotion type in Table 1.
The labeled emoticons can then be used to acquire
training data to train an emotion classifier for a
community in any time period.
We combine the features which have been
proven effective by previous work, such as punc-
tuation and emotion lexicons. Specifically, we use
the following features : 1) Words appearing in
the microblog message serve as word features, 2)
Number of “!” characters and “?” in the microblog
message, and 3) Each term in a general emotion
lexicon serves as an emotion lexicon feature.
The emotion distribution e(m) of a microblog
message m is represented by a N -dimension dis-
tribution vector. For example, if a microblog mes-
sage m is classified as happy, then its emotion dis-
tribution e(m) is [1, 0, 0, 0]. The emotion distribu-
tion of e(u) of user u at time t is average emotion
distribution of the microblog messages posted by
him during time t.
e
t
(u) =
1
N
ut
N
ut
?
m=1
e(m)
(1)
where N
ut
is the number of microblog messages
posted by user u at time t.
4.2 Community-level Emotion Aggregation
A common strategy to measure community emo-
tion is to compute the average emotion of the com-
munity users. It is based on the assumption that the
emotion of different community users are with e-
qual importance. This is implemented by employ-
ing an average aggregation function on the indi-
vidual emotion distribution e
t
(u):
e
t
(c) =
1
N
c
?
u?c
e
t
(u)
(2)
where N
c
is the number of users in community c.
Intuitively, the emotion of user with higher au-
thority in community should be more important in
determining community emotion. Thus we esti-
mate community emotion by taking into account
user’s emotional authority, which is based on the
assumption that different users in a community
have different emotional authorities.
We employ HITS algorithm(Kleinberg, 1999)
to compute the user authority auth(u) based on
the user network {V,E} of the community. Then
auth(u) is used to represent the emotional author-
ity of user u. This authority-based community e-
motion aggregation approach can also reduce the
effect of spam users, since they usually have low
authorities in the community network. For sim-
plicity and computation efficiency, we assume that
auth(u) is time independent, which means that we
only need to run the HITS algorithm once for each
community. Given the user emotion distribution-
s and the user emotional authorities, the emotion
distribution for a community c in time interval t
can be measured as:
e
t
(c) =
1
A
ct
?
u?c
auth(u)e
t
(u)
(3)
where A
ct
=
?
u?c
t
auth(u) is the normalization
term.
4.3 Community Emotion Burst Detection
We formulate our problem into the binary state
model framework (Kleinberg, 2003). For a giv-
en community c, there are T time intervals in
total, with community emotion distribution se-
quence e = (e
1
, e
2
, ..., e
T
) and state sequence
q = (q
1
, q
2
, ..., q
T
). Each q
t
can be one of the fol-
lowing two states: q
t
= 0 (“emotion stable” state)
and q
t
= 1 (“emotion burst” state). Our objective
1162
(a) “emotion stable” state (b) “emotion burst” state
Figure 3: Emotion probability density for “emo-
tion stable” state and “emotion burst” state
is to find an optimal state sequence q
?
given the
emotion distribution sequence e.
Since each e
t
is a distribution rather than pos-
itive integer, the emotion generation process can
no longer be modeled by a Poisson distribution.
We choose to model the emotion generation pro-
cess by the Dirichlet distribution. This process is
analogous to the document-level topic generation
in the LDA topic model (Blei et al., 2003).
If community c is in an “emotion stable” state in
time interval t, its emotion distribution e
t
should
be close to the average emotion distribution e
a
.
The density function is defined as f(e
t
, e
a
, s
t
=
0) = Dirichlet(?
0
e
a
), where s
t
= 0 indicates
that the community is in an “emotion stable” s-
tate and ?
0
is a positive parameter. To ensure
that e
t
closer to e
a
will get higher probability,
?
0
should satisfy the constraint ?
0
· min e
a
> 1.
An example of the probability density function of
f(e
t
, e
a
, s
t
= 0) in a three dimension emotion s-
pace is shown in Figure 3(a).
If community c is in an “emotion burst” s-
tate in time interval t, the emotion distribution
of c is : 1) significantly different from its av-
erage emotion distribution, or 2) extremely un-
even distributed. For example, assume e
a
=
[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25], if community is in burst
in time interval t, its emotion distribution is more
likely to be [0.1, 0.4, 0.1, 0.4] (significantly dif-
ferent from e
a
) or [0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1] (extremely
anger). The density function is then defined as
f(e
t
, e
a
, s
t
= 1) = Dirichlet(?
1
e
a
). s
t
= 1
indicates that the community is in an “emotion
burst” state and ?
1
should satisfy the constraint:
?
1
· max e
a
< 1. An example of the probabili-
ty density function of f(e
t
, e
a
, s
t
= 1) in a three
dimension emotion space is shown in Figure 3(b).
Based on above discussion, the cost function for
an emotion state sequence q can be defined as:
cost(q|e) =
T
?
t=1
? ln(f
t
(e
t
, e
a
, q
t
)) + b ln(
1 ? pi
pi
)
(4)
where pi is the probability the community will
change the emotion state in two consecutive time
intervals t and t + 1. b denotes the number of e-
motion state changes in the whole time intervals
[1, T ].
Equation 4 is exactly the objective function we
need to optimize. This optimization problem can
be efficiently solved by using a dynamic program-
ming procedure, as summarized in Algorithm 1.
Algorithm 1 mainly consists of two phases: a
forward phase (line 5 - line 10) which calculates
the minimal cost for emotion distribution sub-
sequence and a backward phase to construct the
optimal emotion state sequence (line 11 - line 14).
For convenience, we use f
t
(s) to denote
f
t
(e
t
, e
a
, s). pi

5 Experimental Setup
5.1 Data Set
We use a large microblog data set crawled from
Sina Weibo, which is the most popular mi-
croblog service in China. This data set contains
212,859,466 Chinese microblog messages posted
by 916,126 users in a period of about 8 month-
s (1/12/2010? 20/7/2011). We also crawled the
following network, which resulted in 15,681,296
following relationships for the 916,126 users.
We choose four communities: “legal cases”,
“football”, “economy” and “singer”. To obtain the
members for each topical community, we manu-
ally selected several keywords and input them as
queries to the user search page
4
. After filtering out
the users whose microblog messages are not col-
lected in our corpora, we extract the sub-network
of the users from the whole following network.
We use a simple but efficient method to extract
microblog messages for each topical community:
1) If a microblog message is posted by the com-
munity members and also contains keywords of
the community, it belongs to the community; 2)
If a microblog message is posted by community
member u and it is reposting, commenting on or
replying to another microblog posted by commu-
nity member v, then it belongs to the community.
The basic statistics of our data sets are shown in
Table 2.
5.2 Ground Truth Generation
Algorithm 1 generates a list of emotion bursts
for each community. Since our goal is to identi-
fy community-related events, we need to evaluate
how well the generated emotion bursts correspond
to the ground truth real-world events. To gener-
ate the ground truth for evaluation, we utilize the
news website Sina News
5
. Two PhD students are
invited to manually generate a list of real events
for each community by referring to the annual top-
4

5
http://news.sina.com.cn
ic summary page
6
of Sina News. The annotation
agreement is higher than 90%. Each event is al-
so associated with its occurred date. The number
of events for each community is shown in the last
column of Table 2. For each community, the even-
t list is then used to evaluate the performance of
different event detection models.
5.3 Evaluation Metric
We use precision, recall and F-measure as evalu-
ation metric. For each community, we compare
the event list E
c
and the generated burst list B
c
to
compute the above metric. Specifically, the preci-
sion, recall and F-measure for a community c are
defined as follows:
P =
?
|E
c
|
j=1
?
|B
c
|
k=1
I(E

? B

)
|E

|
(6)
F =
2 × P ×R
P + R
(7)
where E
c
j
is the occurring time of the j-th event
in community c, B
c
k
is the k-th identified burst for
community c. I(.) is the indicator function (which
equals 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise).
The final precision, recall and F-measure are av-
eraged over different communities.
5.4 Compared Methods
We now introduce four methods used for compar-
ison as follows:
EmoPeakFind: The method proposed in (Ak-
cora et al., 2010), which aims at discovering
breakpoints from public emotion. They use the
following simple rule to find breakpoints from e-
motion sequences:
Sim(e
t?1
, e
t
) < Sim(e
t?2
, e
t?1
) (8)
Sim(e
t?1
, e
t
) < Sim(e
t
, e
t+1
) (9)
where Sim is a similarity function. We use the
cosine similarity function in our evaluation.
TopKEmoVar: The method used in (Zhao et al.,
2012a). They first derive a sequence of relative
variation V
n
for each single emotion sequence e
n
.
Then they define a sequence of emotion variation
as (
?
4
n=1
|V
n
t
|). This sequence is sorted in de-
scending order and the top-k t is selected as burst

Our Method 0.654 0.715 0.683
state points, where k is set to be the size of the
event list for each community.
KLB: The method proposed in (Kleinberg,
2003). Note that KLB can only deal with a single
sequence e
n
= (e
n
1
, ..., e
n
t
, ...e
n
T
) for emotion type
n. We first apply KLB to find the optimal state se-
quences for each emotion type. Then we perform
an OR function to merge the N state sequences to
a global emotion state sequence.
MBurst: The method proposed in (Zhao et al.,
2012b) for multi-stream burst detection. MBurst
is evaluated on three activity streams in (Zhao et
al., 2012b). Here we apply MBurst to the N emo-
tion streams. Then we perform an OR function to
merge the N state sequences to a global emotion
state sequence.
6 Experimental Results
6.1 Performance Comparison Results
In this experiment, we compare our method with
different baseline methods as introduced in Sec-
tion 5.4. We use Equation (3) to aggregate com-
munity emotion for all the compared methods.
The parameter ?
0
and ?
1
are empirically set to be
5
min
n
e
n
a
and
0.5
max
n
e
n
a
, respectively. The experimen-
tal results are shown in Table 3.
Table 3 shows that EmoPeakFind and TopKE-
moVari are less effective than other methods. The
simple rule used in EmoPeakFind produced many
noisy bursts, leading to low precision. TopKE-
moVari only considers the relative variation of t-
wo consecutive time intervals. The choose of
k is also nontrivial since it is hard to know the
number of events before the events are identi-
fied. Note that EmoPeakFind and TopKEmoVari
are both rule-based methods, while KLB, MBurst
and Our Method are state machine based method-
s. This demonstrates that for community-related
emotion burst detection, it is more appropriate to
use a state machine based model.
It looks surprising that MBurst performs worse
than KLB, since MBurst is specifically designed

schemes in terms of F-measure

football 0.674 0.765
economy 0.642 0.712
singer 0.589 0.665
avg 0.605 0.683
for multiple streams. However, MBurst is based
on the assumption that the states of multiple
streams in the same time interval tend to be the
same (i.e., there is positive correlation between t-
wo different streams). This assumption no longer
holds in the context of different emotion stream-
s. For example, if a negative event occurs in the
community, while sad emotion is likely to be in a
burst state, happy emotion is not likely to be in a
burst state.
We can see from Table 3 that our method out-
performs the four baselines. The main reason is
that our burst detection method is based on the se-
quence of community emotion distribution. Mod-
eling community emotion as a distribution is more
suitable than modeling several different emotion
types.
We further show some example events detected
by our model in Table 4. Since the event keyword-
s are manually translated from Chinese, one key-
word may include more than one English word-
s. We can see that community emotion can help
to detect emotionally significant events for differ-
ent communities. For example, the “legal cases”
community is in a strong anger emotional state on
December 25, 2010, which indicates an important
event “Qian Yunhui’s case”.
6.2 Effect of Emotion Aggregation Functions
In this experiment, we show the importance of cor-
rectly aggregation community level emotion for
community-related event detection. We compare
the two aggregation approaches introduced in sec-
tion 4.2. The first approach assigns equal weight to
each community users, while the second approach
assigns weights to users based on their authorities
in the community.
The performance in terms of F-measure is
shown in Table 5. It is obvious that, for all commu-

emotion types (happy, anger, sad and fear) are mapped to green, red, blue and yellow color, respectively.

nities, HITS-based weighting approach perform-
s better than equal weighting approach. Thus we
can conclude that user authority is important when
aggregating community emotion.
We further perform an empirically analysis of
the events that successfully identified by HITS-
based approach but failed by equal weighting ap-
proach. By manually analyzing the microblog
messages of the corresponding time intervals, we
found that most of the errors of equal weighting
approach were caused by emotion spam. Users of
low authority post many microblog messages with
extreme emotion to claim the attention of the com-
munity. Since there is no significant community-
related events at that time interval, we do not ob-
serve emotional changes of the high authority us-
es. In the equal weighting method, the existence
of emotion spam lead to wrong result of com-
munity emotion. Since the weights of users who
post emotion spam are small in the HITS-based
approach, they have little effect on the communi-
ty emotion. This is the main reason why HITS-
based weighting method is more effective than e-
qual weighting method.
6.3 Parameter Sensitivity

our model by different choices of the param-
eters ?

7 Conclusion
Microblog has become a popular and convenien-
t platform for people to share information about
social events in real time. In this paper, we focus
on the problem of community-related event detec-
tion by community emotions. We propose a novel
method to compute community-level emotion by
considering the user authority in the community
network. Then we present an effective emotion
burst detection algorithm for the community emo-
tion distribution sequence.
We evaluate our approach on real microblog
data sets. Experimental results demonstrate that
it is important to take into account the user au-
thority when aggregating community emotion for
1166
community-related event detection. Our emotion
burst detection algorithm also achieves better per-
formance than several baseline methods.
