Abstract
This paper reports on a study of crowd-
sourcing the annotation of non-local (or
implicit) frame-semantic roles, i.e., roles
that are realized in the previous discourse
context. We describe two annotation se-
tups (marking and gap filling) and find that
gap filling works considerably better, attain-
ing an acceptable quality relatively cheaply.
The produced data is available for research
purposes.
1 Introduction
In the last years, crowdsourcing, e.g., using Ama-
zon’s Mechanical Turk platform, has been used to
collect data for a range of NLP tasks, e.g., MT eval-
uation (Callison-Burch, 2009), sentiment analysis
(Mellebeek et al., 2010), and student answer rat-
ing (Heilman and Smith, 2010). Frame-semantic
role annotation (FSRA) is a task that requires more
linguistic expertise than most data collection tasks
realized with crowdsourcing; nevertheless it is also
a crucial prerequisite for high-performance frame-
semantic role labeling (SRL) systems (Das et al.,
2014). Thus, there are some studies that have in-
vestigated FSRA as a crowdsourcing task. It can be
separated into two parts: First, choosing the frame
evoked by a given predicate in a sentence; second,
assigning the semantic roles associated with the
chosen frame. Hong and Baker (2011) have re-
cently addressed the first step, experimenting with
various ways of presenting the task. Fossati et
al. (2013) have considered both steps and opera-
tionalized them separately and jointly, finding the
best results when a single annotation task is pre-
sented to turkers (due to the interdependence of the
two steps) and when the semantic role description
are simplified. Both studies conclude that crowd-
sourcing can produce usable results for FSRA but
requires careful design. Our study extends these
previous studies to the phenomenon of implicit
(non-locally realized) semantic roles where anno-
tators are presented with a target sentence in para-
graph context, and have to decide for every role
whether it is realized in the target sentence, else-
where in the paragraph, or not at all. Our results
shows that implicit roles can be annotated as well
as locally realized roles in a crowdsourcing setup,
again provided that good design choices are taken.
2 Implicit Semantic Roles
Implicit or non-locally realized semantic roles oc-
cur when arguments of a predicate are understood
although not expressed in its direct syntactic neigh-
borhood. FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) dis-
tinguishes between indefinite non-instantiations
(INIs), which are interpreted generically; definite
non-instantiations (DNIs), which can often be iden-
tified with expressions from the previous context;
and constructional non-instantiations (CNI), e.g.,
passives. For instance, in the following example,
the GOAL of the predicate “reached” is realized
locally, the SOURCE is a non-locally realized DNI,
and the PATH is an INI and not realized at all.

having put his right foot before his left
five hundred and seventy-five times, and
his left foot before his right five hundred
and seventy-six times, reached [

Implicit roles play an important role in discourse
comprehension and coherence (Burchardt et al.,
2005) and have found increasing attention over the
226
last years. The development was kickstarted by the
creation of a corpus of non-local frame-semantic
roles for the SemEval 2010 Task 10 (Ruppenhofer
et al., 2010), which still serves as a de facto stan-
dard. A number of systems perform SRL for non-
local roles (Chen et al., 2010; Silberer and Frank,
2012; Laparra and Rigau, 2013), but the obtained
results are still far from satisfactory, with the best
reported F-Score at 0.19. The main reason is data
sparsity: Due to the small size of the dataset (just
438 sentences), every predicate occurs only a small
number of times. Crowdsourcing can be an attrac-
tive strategy to acquire more annotations.
3 Experimental Setup
3.1 Domain
Our emphasis is on evaluating the annotation of
implicit roles. We reduce complexity by limiting
the number of frames and roles like earlier studies
(Hong and Baker, 2011; Fossati et al., 2013). We
focus on verbs from the MOTION and POSITION
frames, which realize a common set of location
roles (PLACE OF EVENT, SOURCE, GOAL, PATH).
This makes the task more uniform and allows us to
skip frame annotation. Information about spatial
relations, provided by such verbs, can be useful
for many NLP tasks which reason about spatial
information, e.g. systems generating textual de-
scriptions from visual data, robot navigation tasks,
and geographical information systems or GIS (Ko-
rdjamshidi et al., 2012).
3.2 Corpus
We chose the novel “Around the World in Eighty
Days” by Jules Verne, annotating the ten most fre-
quent predicates meeting the conditions described
above for annotation (reach, arrive, descend, rush,
follow, approach, send, cross, escape, pass). A
post-hoc analysis later showed that each instance of
these predicates has on average 0.67 implicit roles
identifiable in previous context, which underlines
the relevance of annotating such cases. Metaphori-
cal uses were discarded before annotation, which
left an average 38.4 instances for each predicate.
4 Annotation and Agreement
We decided to present target sentences with three
sentences of previous context, as a compromise be-
tween reading overhead and coverage of non-local
roles: For nominalizations, the three previous sen-
tences cover over 85% of all non-local roles (Ger-
Source Goal Path Place

Overlap 0.35 0.46 0.52 0.27
Table 1: Raw agreement among annotators in the
“marking” task
ber and Chai, 2012). An example and the detailed
description of the task were provided to the an-
notators through external links. We experimented
with two alternatives: annotation as a marking task
and as a gap filling task (explained below). Each
HIT was annotated by five turkers who were asked
to annotate both local and non-local roles, since
identification of local roles is necessary for reliable
tagging of non-local roles.
4.1 Marking Task
Our rationale was to make the task as comprehen-
sible as possible for non-experts. In each HIT, the
target predicate in its context was shown in bold-
face and the annotators were asked to answer four
questions about “the event in bold”: (a) where does
the event take place?; (b) what is its starting point?;
(c) what is its end point?; (d) which path is used?
For every question, turkers were asked to either
mark a text span (shown in a non-editable field
below the question) or click a button labeled “not
found in the text”. The goals of this setup were (a)
to minimize annotation effort, and (b) to make the
task as layman-compatible as possible, following
Fossati et al.’s (2013) observation that linguistic
definitions can harm results.
After annotating some instances, we computed
raw inter-annotator agreement (IAA). Table 1
shows IAA among turkers in two conditions (aver-
age pairwise Exact Match and word-based Overlap)
overall annotations for the first 49 instances.
1
The
overall IAA is 37.9% (Exact Match) and 40.1%
(Overlap). We found these results to be too low to
continue this approach. The low results for Overlap
indicate that the problems cannot be due mainly to
differences in the marked spans. Indeed, an analy-
sis showed that the main reason was that annotators
were often confused by the presence of multiple
predicates in the paragraph. Consequently, many
answers marked roles pertaining not to the bolded
target predicate but to other predicates, such as (2).

Tannah, goes over the chain of the West-
ern Ghauts, [. . . ] and, descending south-
eastward by Burdivan and the French town
of Chandernagor, has its terminus at Cal-
cutta.
Annotators would be expected to annotate the
continent opposite Tannah as the goal of crossing,
but some annotated Calcutta, the final destination
of the chain of motion events described.
4.2 Gap Filling Task
Seeing that the marking task did not constrain the
interpretation of the turkers sufficiently, we moved
to a second setup, gap filling, with the aim of fo-
cussing the turkers’ attention to a single predicate
rather than the complete set of predicates present
in the text shown. In this task, the annotators were
asked to complete the sentence by filling in the
blanks in two sentences:
1. [Agent] [Event+ed] from . . . to . . .
through . . . path.
2. The whole event took place in/at . . .
The first sentence corresponds to annotations of
the SOURCE, GOAL, and PATH roles; the second
one of the PLACE role. The rationale is that the
presence of the predicate in the sentence focuses
the turkers’ attention on the predicate’s actual roles.
Annotators could leave gaps empty (in the case of
unrealized roles), and we asked them to remain as
close to the original material as possible, that is,
avoid paraphrases. Perfect copying is not always
possible, due to grammatical constraints.
Table 2 shows the IAA for this design. We see
that even though the gap filling introduced a new
source of variability (namely, the need for annota-
tors to copy text), the IAA improves considerably,
by up to 11% in Exact Match and 15% in Over-
lap. The new overall IAAs are 44.7% (+6.8%) and
50.2% (+10.1%), respectively. Overall, the num-
bers are still fairly low. However, note that these
IAA numbers among turkers are a lower bound for
the agreement between a “canonical” version of
the turkers’ annotation (see Section 5) and an ideal
gold standard. Additionally, a data analysis showed
that in the gap filling setup, many of the disagree-
ments are more well-behaved: unsurprisingly, they
are often cases where annotators disagree on the ex-
act range of the string to fill into the gap. Consider
the following example:
(3) Skillful detectives have been sent to all the
principal ports of America and the Conti-
nent, and he’ll be a clever fellow if he slips
through their fingers.”
Arguably, experts would annotate all the prin-
cipal ports of America and the Continent as the
GOAL role of sent. Turkers however annotated dif-
ferent spans, including all the principal ports of
America, ports, as well as the “correct” span. The
lowest IAA is found for the place role. While it is
possible that our setup which required turkers to
consider a second sentence to annotate place con-
tributes to the overall difficulty, our data analysis
indicates that the main problem is the more vague
nature of PLACE compared to the other roles which
made it more difficult for annotators to tag consis-
tently. Consider Example (1): the PLACE could
be, among other things, the City, London, England,
etc. The large number of locations in the novel is a
compounding factor. We found that for some pred-
icates (e.g. arrive, reach), many turkers attempted
to resolve the ambiguity by (erroneously) annotat-
ing the same text as both GOAL and PLACE, which
runs counter to the FrameNet guidelines.
5 Canonicalization
We still need to compute a “canonical” annotation
that combines the five turker’s annotations. First,
we need to decide whether a role should be realized
or left unrealized (i.e., INI, CNI, or DNI but not in
the presented context). Second, we need to decide
on a span for realized roles. Canonicalization in
crowdsourcing often assumes a majority principle,
accepting the analysis proposed by most turkers.
We found it necessary to be more flexible. Regard-
ing realization, a manual analysis of a few instances
showed that cases of two turker annotations with
non-empty overlap could be accepted as non-local
roles. That is, turkers frequently miss non-local
roles, but if two out of five annotate an overlapping
span with the same role, this is reasonable evidence.
Regarding the role’s span, we used the consensus

Table 4: Raw agreement between canonical anno-
tation and expert annotation by realization status
span if it existed, and the maximal (union) span oth-
erwise, given that some turkers filled the gaps just
with head words and not complete constituents. To
test the quality of the canonical annotation, one of
the authors had previously annotated 100 random
instances that were also presented to the turkers.
We consider the result to be an expert annotation
approximating a gold standard and use it to judge
the quality of the canonical turker annotations. The
results are shown in Table 3.
The overall raw agreement numbers are 67.80%
(Exact Match) and 69.34% (Overlap). As we had
hoped, the agreement between the canonical crowd-
sourcing annotation and the expert annotation is
again substantially higher than the IAA among turk-
ers. Again, we see the highest numbers for path
(the most specific role) and the lowest numbers for
place (the least specific role).
To assess whether the number obtained in table
3 are sensitive to realization status (explicit, im-
plicit or unrealized), we broke down the agreement
numbers by realization status. Somewhat to our
(positive) surprise, the results in Table 4 indicate
that non-locally realized roles are annotated ablut
as reliably as locally realized ones. Except for the
ill-defined PLACE role, our reliability is compara-
ble to Fossati et al. (2013). Given the more difficult
nature of the task (annotators are given more con-
text and have to make a more difficult decision),
we consider this a promising result.
6 Final Dataset and Cost
The final dataset consists of 384 predicate in-
stances.
2
With four roles per predicate, a total
of 1536 roles could have been realized. We found

feizabadi/res.mhtml
that more than half (60%) of the roles remained
unrealized even in context. 23% of the roles were
realized locally, and 17% non-locally. The distri-
bution over locally realized, non-locally realized,
and unrealized roles varies considerably among the
four roles that we consider. GOAL has the high-
est percentage of realized roles overall (unrealized
only for 34% of all predicate instances), and at the
same time the highest ratio of locally realized roles
(48% locally realized, 18% non-locally). This cor-
responds well to FrameNet’s predictions about our
chosen predicates which realize the Goal role gen-
erally as the direct object (reach) or an obligatory
prepositional phrase (arrive). In contrast, SOURCE
is realized only for 36% of all instances, and then
predominantly non-locally (24% non-local vs. 12%
local). This shows once more that a substantial part
of predicate-argument structure must be recovered
from previous discourse context.
On average, each HIT page was annotated in 1
minute and 48 seconds, which means 27 seconds
per each role and a total of 60 hours for the whole
annotation. We paid 0.15 USD for each HIT. Since
the number of roles in all HITs was fixed to four
(source, goal, path and place), each role cost 0.04
USD, which corresponds to about USD 0.19 for
every canonical role annotation. This is about twice
the amount paid by Fossati et al. and reflects the
increased effort inherent in a task that involves
discourse context.
7 Conclusion
This paper presented a study on crowdsourcing the
annotation of non-local semantic roles in discourse
context, comparing a marking and a gap filling
setup. We found that gap filling is the more reliable
choice since the repetition of the predicate helps
focusing the turkers’ attention on the roles at hand
rather than understanding of the global text. Thus,
the semantic role-based crowdsourcing approach of
Fossati et al. (2013) appears to be generalizable to
the area of non-locally realized roles, provided that
the task is defined suitably. Our results also support
Fossati et al.’s observation that reliable annotations
can be obtained without providing definitions of
semantic roles. However, we also find large differ-
ences among semantic roles. Some (like PATH) can
be annotated reliably and should be usable to train
or improve SRL systems. Others (like PLACE) are
defined so vaguely that it is unclear how usable
their annotations are.
