Abstract
We investigate the use of language in food
writing, specifically on restaurant menus and
in customer reviews. Our approach is to build
predictive models of concrete external vari-
ables, such as restaurant menu prices. We
make use of a dataset of menus and customer
reviews for thousands of restaurants in several
U.S. cities. By focusing on prediction tasks
and doing our analysis at scale, our method-
ology allows quantitative, objective measure-
ments of the words and phrases used to de-
scribe food in restaurants. We also explore
interactions in language use between menu
prices and sentiment as expressed in user re-
views.
1 Introduction
What words might a menu writer use to justify the
high price of a steak? How does describing an item
as chargrilled vs. charbroiled affect its price? When
a customer writes an unfavorable review of a restau-
rant, how is her word choice affected by the restau-
rant’s prices? In this paper, we explore questions
like these that relate restaurant menus, prices, and
customer sentiment. Our goal is to understand how
language is used in the food domain, and we di-
rect our investigation using external variables such
as restaurant menu prices.
We build on a thread of NLP research that seeks
linguistic understanding by predicting real-world
quantities from text data. Recent examples include
prediction of stock volatility (Kogan et al., 2009)
and movie revenues (Joshi et al., 2010). There, pre-
diction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation
and objective model comparison, while analysis of
learned models gave insight about the social process
behind the data.
We echo this pattern here as we turn our atten-
tion to language use on restaurant menus and in user
restaurant reviews. We use data from a large cor-
pus of restaurant menus and reviews crawled from
the web and formulate several prediction tasks. In
addition to predicting menu prices, we also consider
predicting sentiment along with price.
The relationship between language and senti-
ment is an active area of investigation (Pang and
Lee, 2008). Much of this research has focused on
customer-written reviews of goods and services, and
perspectives have been gained on how sentiment is
expressed in this type of informal text. In addition
to sentiment, however, other variables are reflected
in a reviewer’s choice of words, such as the price of
the item under consideration. In this paper, we take
a step toward joint modeling of multiple variables
in review text, exploring connections between price
and sentiment in restaurant reviews.
Hence this paper contributes an exploratory data
1357
analysis of language used to describe food (by its
purveyors and by its consumers). While our primary
goal is to understand the language used in our cor-
pus, our findings bear relevance to economics and
hospitality research as well. This paper is a step on
the way to the eventual goal of using linguistic anal-
ysis to understand social phenomena like sales and
consumption.
2 Related Work
There are several areas of related work scattered
throughout linguistics, NLP, hospitality research,
and economics.
Freedman and Jurafsky (2011) studied the use of
language in food advertising, specifically the words
on potato chip bags. They argued that, due to
the ubiquity of food writing across cultures, eth-
nic groups, and social classes, studying the use of
language for describing food can provide perspec-
tive on how different socioeconomic groups self-
identify using language and how they are linguisti-
cally targeted. In particular, they showed that price
affects how “authenticity” is realized in marketing
language, a point we return to in §5. This is an ex-
ample of how price can affect how an underlying
variable is expressed in language. Among other ex-
plorations in this paper, we consider how price inter-
acts with expression of sentiment in user reviews of
restaurants.
As mentioned above, our work is related to re-
search in predicting real-world quantities using text
data (Koppel and Shtrimberg, 2006; Ghose et al.,
2007; Lerman et al., 2008; Kogan et al., 2009; Joshi
et al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010; Eisenstein et
al., 2011; Yogatama et al., 2011). Like much of
this prior work, we aim to learn how language is
used in a specific context while building models that
achieve competitive performance on a quantitative
prediction task.
Along these lines, there is recent interest in ex-
ploring the relationship between product sales and
user-generated text, particularly online product re-
views. For example, Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011)
studied the sales impact of particular properties of
review text, such as readability, the presence of
spelling errors, and the balance between subjective
and objective statements. Archak et al. (2011) had a
similar goal but decomposed user reviews into parts
describing particular aspects of the product being
reviewed (Hu and Liu, 2004). Our paper differs
from price modeling based on product reviews in
several ways. We consider a large set of weakly-
related products instead of a homogeneous selection
of a few products, and the reviews in our dataset are
not product-centered but rather describe the overall
experience of visiting a restaurant. Consequently,
menu items are not always mentioned in reviews and
rarely appear with their exact names. This makes it
difficult to directly use review features in a pricing
model for individual menu items.
Menu planning and pricing has been studied for
many years by the culinary and hospitality research
community (Kasavana and Smith, 1982; Kelly et al.,
1994), often including recommendations for writing
menu item descriptions (Miller and Pavesic, 1996;
McVety et al., 2008). Their guidelines frequently
include example menus from successful restaurants,
but typically do not use large corpora of menus or
automated analysis, as we do here. Other work
focused more specifically on particular aspects of
the language used on menus, such as the study by
Zwicky and Zwicky (1980), who made linguistic ob-
servations through manual analysis of a corpus of
200 menus.
Relatedly, Wansink et al. (2001; 2005) showed
that the way that menu items are described af-
fects customers’ perceptions and purchasing behav-
ior. When menu items are described evocatively,
customers choose them more often and report higher
satisfaction with quality and value, as compared to
when they are given the same items described with
conventional names. Wansink et al. did not use a
corpus, but rather conducted a small-scale experi-
ment in a working cafeteria with customers and col-
lected surveys to analyze consumer reaction. While
our goals are related, our experimental approach is
different, as we use automated analysis of thousands
of restaurant menus and rely on a set of one mil-
lion reviews as a surrogate for observing customer
behavior.
Finally, the connection between products and
prices is also a central issue in economics. How-
ever, the stunning heterogeneity in products makes
empirical work challenging. For example, there are
over 50,000 menu items in New York that include

the word chicken. What is the price of chicken? This
is an important practical and daunting matter when
measuring inflation (e.g., Consumer Price Index is
measured with a precisely-defined basket of goods).
Price dispersion across goods and the variation of
the goods is an important area of industrial organi-
zation economic theory. For example, economists
are interested in models of search, add-on pricing,
and obfuscation (Baye et al., 2006; Ellison, 2005).
3 Data
We crawled Allmenus.com (www.allmenus.
com) to gather menus for restaurants in seven
U.S. cities: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New
York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washing-
ton, D.C. Each menu includes a list of item names
with optional text descriptions and prices. Most All-
menus restaurant pages contain a link to the cor-
responding page on Yelp (www.yelp.com) with
metadata and user reviews for the restaurant, which
we also collected.
The metadata consist of many fields for each
restaurant, which can be divided into three cate-
gories: location (city, neighborhood, transit stop),
services available (take-out, delivery, wifi, parking,
etc.), and ambience (good for groups, noise level,
attire, etc.). Also, the category of food and a price
range ($ to $$$$, indicating the price of a typical
meal at the restaurant) are indicated. The user re-
views include a star rating on a scale of 1 to 5.
The distribution of prices of individual menu
items is highly skewed, with a mean of $9.22 but
a median of $6.95. On average, a restaurant has
73 items on its menu with a median price of $8.69
and 119 Yelp reviews with a median rating of 3.55

stars. The star rating and price range distributions
are shown in Figure 1.
The set of restau ts was randomly split into
three parts (80% for training, 10% for development,
10% for evaluation), independently for each city.
The sizes of the splits and the full set of dataset
statistics are provided in Table 1.
4 Predictive Tasks
We consider several prediction tasks using the
dataset just described. These include predicting
individual menu item prices (§5), predicting the
price range for each restaurant (§6), and finally
jointly predicting median price and sentiment for
each restaurant (§7). To do this, we use two types
of models: linear regression (§5 and §6) and logis-
tic regression (§7), both with `1 regularization when
sparsity is desirable. We tune the regularization co-
efficient by choosing the value that minimizes de-
velopment set loss (mean squared error and log loss,
respectively).
For evaluation, we use mean absolute error
(MAE) and mean relative error (MRE). Given a
dataset ?xi, yi?Ni=1 with inputs xi and outputs yi, and
1359
denoting predicted outputs by yˆi, these are defined
as follows:
MAE =

i=1

yi ? yˆi

In practice, since we model log-prices but eval-
uate on real prices, the final prediction is often a
non-linear transformation of the output of the linear
classifier of weight vector w, which we denote by:
yˆi = f(w>xi).
We also frequently report the total number of fea-
tures available in the training set for each model (nf)
as well as the number of non-zero feature weights
following learning (nnz).
5 Menu Item Price Prediction
We first consider the problem of predicting the price
of each item on a menu. In this case, every in-
stance xi corresponds to a single item in the menu
parametrized by the features detailed below and yi is
the item’s price. In this section, our models always
use the logarithm of the price1 as output values and
therefore: yˆi = ew
>xi .
Baselines We evaluate several baselines which
make independent predictions for each distinct item
name. The first two predict the mean or the me-
dian of the prices in the training set for a given
item name, and use the overall price mean or me-
dian when a name is missing in the training set. The
third baseline is an `1-regularized linear regression
model trained with a single binary feature for each
item name in the training data. These baselines are
shown as the first three rows in Table 2.
We note that there is a wide variation of menu
item names in the dataset, with more than 400,000
distinct names. Although we address this issue later
by introducing local text features, we also performed
simple normalization of the item names for all of
the baselines described above. To do this normal-
ization, we first compiled a stop word list based on
the most frequent words in the item names.2 We

removed stop words and then ordered the words in
each item name lexicographically, in order to col-
lapse together items such as coffee black and black
coffee. This normalization reduced the unique item
name count by 40%, strengthening the baselines.
5.1 Features
We use `1-regularized linear regression for feature-
rich models. We now introduce several sets of fea-
tures that we add to the normalized item names:3
I. METADATA: Binary features for each restaurant
metadata field mentioned above, excluding price
range. A separate binary feature is included for
each unique ?field, value? tuple.
II. MENUNAMES: n-grams in menu item names.
We used binary features for unique unigrams, bi-
grams, and trigrams. Here, stop words were re-
tained as they can be informative (e.g., with and
large correlate with price).
III. MENUDESC: n-grams in menu item descrip-
tions, as in MENUNAMES.
Review Features In addition to these features, we
consider leveraging the large amount of text present
in user reviews to improve predictions. We at-
tempted to find mentions of menu items in the re-
views and to include features extracted from the sur-
rounding words in the model. Perfect item mentions
being relatively rare, we consider inexact matches
weighted by a coefficient measuring the degree of
resemblance: we used the Dice similarity between
the set of words in the sentence and in the item name.
We then extracted n-gram features from this sen-
tence, and tried several ways to use them for price
prediction.
Given a review sentence, one option is to add the
corresponding features to every item matching this
sentence, with a value equal to the similarity coeffi-
cient. Another option is to select the best matching
item and use the same real-valued features but only
for this single item. Binary feature values can be
used instead of the real-valued similarity coefficient.
We also experimented with the use of part-of-speech
tags in order to restrict our features to adjective and
adverb n-grams instead of the full vocabulary. All of
3The normalized item names are present as binary features
in all of our regression models

these attempts yielded negative or only slightly pos-
itive results, of which we include only one example
in our experiments: the MENTIONS feature set con-
sists of n-grams for the best matching item with the
Dice coefficient as the feature value.
We also tried to incorporate the reviews by using
them in aggregate via predictions from a separate
model; we found this approach to work better than
the methods described above which all use features
from the reviews directly in the regression model. In
particular, we use the review features in a separate
model that we will describe below (§6) to predict
the price range of each restaurant. The model uses
unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams extracted from the
reviews. We use the estimated price range (which we
denote P?R) as a single additional real-valued feature
for individual item price prediction.
5.2 Results
Our results are shown in Table 2. We achieve a fi-
nal reduction of 50 cents in MAE and nearly 10%
in MRE compared with the baselines. Using menu
name features (MENUNAMES) brings the bulk of
the improvement, though menu description features
(MENUDESC) and the remaining features also lead
to small gains. Interestingly, as the MENUDESC and
P?R features are added to the model, the regulariza-
tion favors more general features by selecting fewer
and fewer non-zero weights.
While METADATA features improve over the
baselines when used alone, they do not lead to im-
proved performance over the MENU* + P?R features,
suggesting that the text features may be able to sub-
stitute for the information in the metadata, at least
for prediction of individual item prices.
The MENTIONS features resulted in a small im-
provement in MAE and MRE, but at the cost of ex-
panding the model size significantly. A look at the
learned feature weights reveals that most of the se-
lected features seem more coincidental than generic
(rachel’s, highly negative) when not totally unintu-
itive (those suicide, highest positive). This suggests
that our method of extracting features from men-
tions is being hampered by noise. We suspect that
these features could be more effective with a better
method of linking menu items to mentions in review
text.
5.3 Analysis
We also inspected the feature weights of our learned
models. By comparing the weights of related fea-
tures, we can see the relative differences in terms
of contribution to menu item prices. Table 3 shows
example feature weights, manually arranged into
several categories (taken from the model with ME-
NUNAMES + MENUDESC + P?R + METADATA).
Table 3(a) shows selected features for the “am-
bience” field in the Yelp restaurant metadata and
pane (b) lists some unigrams related to cooking
methods. Pane (c) shows feature weights for n-
grams often used to market menu items; we see
larger weights for words targeting those who want to
eat organically- or locally-grown food (farmhouse,
heirloom, wild, and hormone), compared to those
looking for comfort food (old time favorite, tradi-
tional, real, and fashioned). This is related to ob-
servations made by Freedman and Jurafsky (2011)
that cheaper food is marketed by appealing to tra-
dition and historicity, with more expensive food de-
scribed in terms of naturalness, quality of ingredi-
ents, and the preparation process (e.g., hand picked,
wild caught, etc.). Relatedly, in pane (e) we see
that real mashed potatoes are expected to be cheaper
than those described as creamy or smooth.
Pane (d) shows feature weights for trigrams con-
taining units of chicken; we can see an ordering in
terms of size (bits < cubes < strips < cuts) as well
as the price increase associated with the use of the
word morsels in place of less refined units. We also
see a difference between pieces and pcs, with the
latter being frequently used to refer to entire cuts of

to slight variations in word form. We find that, even
though crispy has a higher weight than crisp, crisp
bacon is more expensive than crispy bacon. We also
find that food items prefixed with roast lead to more
expensive prices than the similar roasted, except in
the case of pork, though here the different forms may
be evoking two different preparation styles.
Also of note is the slight difference between
the nonstandard mash potato and mashed potato.
We observed lower weights with other nonstandard
spellings, notably portobella having lower weight
than each of the more common spellings portabella,
portobello, and portabello.
6 Restaurant Price Range Prediction
In addition to predicting the prices of individual
menu items, we also considered the task of predict-
ing the price range listed for each restaurant on its
Yelp page. The values for this field are integers from
1 to 4 and indicate the price of a typical meal from
the restaurant.
For this task, we again train an `1-regularized
linear regression model with integral price ranges
as the true output values yi. Each input xi corre-
sponds to the feature vector for an entire restaurant.
For evaluation, we round the predicted values to the
nearest integer: yˆi = ROUND(w>xi) and report the
corresponding mean absolute error and accuracy.
We compared this simple approach with an or-
dinal regression model (McCullagh, 1980) trained
with the same `1 regularizer and noted very little im-
provement (77.32% vs. 77.15% accuracy for META-
DATA). Therefore, we only report in this section re-
sults for the linear regression model.
In addition to the feature sets used for individ-
ual menu item price prediction, we used features on
reviews (REVIEWS). Specifically, we used binary
features for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in the
full set of reviews for each restaurant. A stopword
list was derived from the training data.4 Bigrams
and trigrams were filtered if they ended with stop-
words. Additionally, features occurring fewer than
three times in the training set were discarded.
4This list is included in the supplementary material.

6.1 Results
Our results for price range prediction are shown
in Table 4. Predicting the most frequent price
range gave us an accuracy of 48.22%. Performance
improvements were obtained by separately adding
menu (MENU*), metadata (METADATA), and re-
view features (REVIEWS). Unlike individual item
price prediction, the reviews were more helpful than
the menu features for predicting overall price range.
This is not surprising, since reviewers will often gen-
erally discuss price in their reviews. We combined
metadata and review features to get our best accu-
racy, exceeding 80%.
We also wanted to perform an analysis of senti-
ment in the review text. To do this, we trained a lo-
gistic regression model predicting polarity for each
review; we used the REVIEWS feature set, but this
time considering each review as a single training in-
stance. The polarity of a review was determined by
whether or not its star rating was greater than the
average rating across all reviews in the dataset (3.7
stars). We achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test
data. We omit full details of these models because
the polarity prediction task for user reviews is well-
known in the sentiment analysis community and our
model is not an innovation over prior work (Pang
and Lee, 2008). However, our purpose in training
the model was to use the learned weights for under-
standing the text in the reviews.
6.2 Interpreting Reviews
Given learned models for predicting a restaurant’s
price range from its set of reviews as well as polar-
ity for each review, we can turn the process around
and use the feature weights to analyze the review
text. Restricting our attention to reviews of 50–60
words, Table 5 shows sample reviews from our test
set that lead to various predictions of price range and
sentiment.5
This technique can also be useful when trying to
determine the “true” star rating for a review (if pro-
vided star ratings are noisy), or to show the most
positive and most negative reviews for a product
within a particular star rating. The 5-point scale
is merely a coarse approximation to the reviewer’s
mental state; using fitted models can provide addi-
tional clues to decode the reviewer’s sentiment.
We can also do a more fine-grained analysis of
review text by noting the contribution to the price
range prediction of each position in the text stream.
This is straightforward because our features are sim-
ply n-grams of the review text. In Figure 2, we show
the influence of each word in a review sentence on
the predicted polarity (brown) and price range (yel-
low). The height of a bar at a given position is pro-
portional to the sum of the feature weights for every
unigram, bigram, and trigram containing the token
at that position (there are at most 6 active n-grams
at a position).
The first example shows the smooth shift in ex-
pressed sentiment from the beginning of the sen-
tence to the end. The second sentence is a difficult
example for sentiment analysis, since there are sev-
eral positive words and phrases early but the senti-
ment is chiefly expressed in the final clause. Our
model noted the steady positive sentiment early in
the sentence but identified the crucial negation due
to strong negative weight on bigrams fresh but, left
me, and me yearning. In both examples, the yellow
bars show that price estimates are reflected mainly
through isolated mentions of offerings and ameni-
ties (drinks, atmosphere, security, good service).
7 Joint Prediction of Price and Sentiment
Although we observe no interesting correlation (r =
0.06) between median star rating and median item
price in our dataset, this does not imply that senti-
5To choose the 9 reviews in the table, we took the reviews
from our test set in the desired length range and computed pre-
dicted sentiment and price range for each; then we scaled the
predicted price range so that its range matched that of predicted
sentiment, and maximized various linear combinations of the
two. This accounts for the four corners. The others were found
by maximizing a linear combination of one (possibly negated)
prediction minus the absolute value of the other.

i love me a cheap vietnamese sandwich .

great place to get fast food that tastes good .
paneer and chicken are both good . i would
prefer to go thursday thru saturday night .
thats when they have their good shift work-
ing . also it stays open late until 4 am on
weekends . really enjoyable !
had some solid thai here for lunch last week
. ordered the special of the day , a chicken
curry . quick service and nice interior . only
issue was , had a bit of a stomach ache after-
wards ? prefer their sister restaurant , citizen
thai and the monkey , in north beach .
weekday evening was quiet , not every ta-
ble was filled . our waiter was amicable and
friendly , which is always a plus . the co-
conut bread pudding was ok and very sweet
. it ’s definitely a dessert plate that can be
shared with a glass of wine .

for some reason my friend wanted me to
go here with him . it was a decent standard
greasy slice of pizza . it was n’t bad by any
means , but it was nothing special at all .
on the plus side , cheap and fast . so in
summary : cheap , fast , greasy , average .
ugh ! the salt ! all 5 dishes we ordered were
so unbearably salty , i ’d rather just have the

better chinese food to be had in sf than here .
i was very disappointed and wo n’t be back .
downhill alert ... had a decent lunch at
dragon well this week marred by pretty
spotty service . our waiter just did n’t have
it together , forgetting to bring bowls for our
split soup , our beverages , etc. . food was
good but pretty pricey for what we got .

ment and price are independent of each other.6 We
try to capture this interaction by modeling at the
same time review polarity and item price: we con-
sider the task of jointly predicting aggregate senti-
ment and price for a restaurant.
For every restaurant in our dataset, we compute
its median item price p¯ and its median star rating
r¯. The average of these two values for the entire
dataset ($8.69 and 3.55 stars) split the plane (p¯, r¯)
in four sections: we assign each restaurant to one of
these quadrants which we denote ? 	, ? ?, ? 	 and
? ?. This allows us to train a 4-class logistic regres-

sion model using the REVIEWS feature set for each
restaurant. We achieve an accuracy of 65% on the
test data, but we are mainly interested in interpret-
ing the estimated feature weights.
7.1 Analysis
To visualize the top feature weights learned by the
model, we have to map the four weight vectors
learned by the model back to the underlying two-
dimensional sentiment/price space. Therefore, we
compute the following values:
w$ = (w?? + w?	)? (w?? + w?	)
wF = (w?? + w??)? (w?	 + w?	)
1364
We then select for display the features which are the
furthest from the origin (maxw2$ + w
2
F) and rep-
resent the selected n-grams as points in the senti-
ment/price space to obtain Figure 3.
We notice that the spread of the sentiment values
is larger, which suggests that reviews give stronger
clues about consumer experience than about the cost
of a typical meal. However, obvious price-related
adjectives (inexpensive vs. expensive) appear in this
limited selection, as well as certain phrases indicat-
ing both sentiment and price (overpriced vs. very
reasonable). Other examples of note: gem is used in
strongly-positive reviews of cheap restaurants; for
expensive restaurants, reviewers use highly recom-
mended or amazing. Also, phrases like no flavor and
manager appear in negative reviews of more expen-
sive restaurants, while dirty appears more often in
negative reviews of cheaper restaurants.
8 Conclusion
We have explored linguistic relationships between
food prices and customer sentiment through quan-
titative analysis of a large corpus of menus and re-
views. We have also proposed visualization tech-
niques to better understand what our models have
learned and to see how they can be applied to new
data. More broadly, this paper is an example of us-
ing extrinsic variables to drive model-building for
linguistic data, and future work might explore richer
extrinsic variables toward a goal of task-driven no-
tions of semantics.
