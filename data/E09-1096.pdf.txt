Abstract 
In this paper, we present a feature-based me-
thod to align documents with similar content 
across two sets of bilingual comparable cor-
pora from daily news texts. We evaluate the 
contribution of each individual feature and 
investigate the incorporation of these diverse 
statistical and heuristic features for the task of 
bilingual document alignment. Experimental 
results on the English-Chinese and English-
Malay comparable news corpora show that 
our proposed Discrete Fourier Transform-
based term frequency distribution feature is 
very effective. It contributes 4.1% and 8% to 
performance improvement over Pearson’s 
correlation method on the two comparable 
corpora. In addition, when more heuristic and 
statistical features as well as a bilingual dic-
tionary are utilized, our method shows an ab-
solute performance improvement of 23.2% 
and 15.3% on the two sets of bilingual corpo-
ra when comparing with a prior information 
retrieval-based method.  
1 Introduction 
The problem of document alignment is described 
as the task of aligning documents, news articles 
for instance, across two corpora based on content 
similarity. The groups of corpora can be in the 
same or in different languages, depending on the 
purpose of one’s task. In our study, we attempt to 
align similar documents across comparable cor-
pora which are bilingual, each set written in a 
different language but having similar content and 
domain coverage for different communication 
needs. 
Previous works on monolingual document 
alignment focus on automatic alignment between 
documents and their presentation slides or be-
tween documents and their abstracts. Kan (2007) 
uses two similarity measures, Cosine and Jac-
card, to calculate the candidate alignment score 
in his SlideSeer system, a digital library software 
that retrieves documents and their narrated slide 
presentations. Daumé and Marcu (2004) use a 
phrase-based HMM model to mine the alignment 
between documents and their human-written ab-
stracts. The main purpose of this work is to in-
crease the size of the training corpus for a 
statistical-based summarization system. 
The research on similarity calculation for mul-
tilingual comparable corpora has attracted more 
attention than monolingual comparable corpora. 
However, the purpose and scenario of these 
works are rather varied. Steinberger et al. (2002) 
represent document contents using descriptor 
terms of a multilingual thesaurus EUROVOC1, 
and calculate the semantic similarity based on the 
distance between the two documents’ representa-
tions. The assignment of descriptors is trained by 
log-likelihood test and computed by ?????, Co-
sine, and Okapi. Similarly, Pouliquen et al. 
(2004) use a linear combination of three types of 
knowledge: cognates, geographical place names 
reference, and map documents based on the 
EUROVOC. The major limitation of these works 
is the use of EUROVOC, which is a specific re-
source workable only for European languages. 
Aligning documents across parallel corpora is 
another area of interest. Patry and Langlais (2005) 
use three similarity scores, Cosine, Normalized 
Edit Distance, and Sentence Alignment Score, to 
compute the similarity between two parallel doc-
uments. An Adaboost classifier is trained on a list 
of scored text pairs labeled as parallel or non-
parallel. Then, the learned classifier is used to 
check the correctness of each alignment candidate. 
Their method is simple but effective. However, 
the features used in this method are only suitable 
for parallel corpora as the measurement is mainly 
based on structural similarity. One goal of docu-
ment alignment is for parallel sentence extraction 
for applications like statistical machine transla-
tion. Cheung and Fung (2004) highlight that most 
                                                          
1 EUROVOC is a multilingual thesaurus covering the fields 
in which the European Communities are active.  
843
of the current sentence alignment models are ap-
plicable for parallel documents, rather than com-
parable documents. In addition, they argue that 
document alignment should be done before paral-
lel sentence extraction.  
Tao and Zhai (2005) propose a general method 
to extract comparable bilingual text without us-
ing any linguistic resources. The main feature of 
this method is the frequency correlation of words 
in different languages. They assume that those 
words in different languages should have similar 
frequency correlation if they are actually transla-
tions of each other. The association between two 
documents is then calculated based on this in-
formation using Pearson’s correlation together 
with two monolingual features 25?? , a term 
frequency normalization (Stephan et al., 1994), 
and ???. The main advantages of this approach 
are that it is purely statistical-based and it is lan-
guage-independent. However, its performance 
may be compromised due to the lack of linguistic 
knowledge, particularly across corpora which are 
linguistically very different. Recently, Munteanu 
(2006) introduces a rather simple way to get the 
group of similar content document in multilin-
gual comparable corpus by using the Lemur IR 
Toolkit (Ogilvie and Callan, 2001). This method 
first pushes all the target documents into the da-
tabase of the Lemur, and then uses a word-by-
word translation of each source document as a 
query to retrieve similar content target docu-
ments.  
This paper will leverage on previous work, 
and propose and explore diverse range of fea-
tures in our system. Our document alignment 
system consists of three stages: candidate genera-
tion, feature extraction and feature combination. 
We verify our method on two set of bilingual 
news comparable corpora English-Chinese and 
English-Malay. Experimental results show that 
1) when only using Fourier Transform-based 
term frequency, our method outperforms our re-
implementation of Tao (2005)’s method by 4.1% 
and 8% for the top 100 alignment candidates and, 
2) when using all features, our method signifi-
cantly outperforms our implementation of Mun-
teanu’s (2006) method by 23.2% and 15.3%.  
The paper is organized as follows. In section 
2, we describe the overall architecture of our sys-
tem. Section 3 discusses our improved frequency 
correlation-based feature, while Section 4 de-
scribes in detail the document relationship heu-
ristics used in our model. Section 5 reports the 
experimental results. Finally, we conclude our 
work in section 6. 
2 System Architecture 
Fig 1 shows the general architecture of our doc-
ument alignment system. It consists of three 
components: candidate generation, feature ex-
traction, and feature combination. Our system 
works on two sets of monolingual corpora to de-
rive a set of document alignments that are com-
parable in their content. 
Fig 1. Architecture for Document Alignment Model. 
2.1 Candidate Generation 
Like many other text processing systems, the 
system first defines two filtering criteria to prune 
out “clearly bad” candidates. This will dramati-
cally reduce the search space. We implement the 
following filers for this purpose: 
Date-Window Filter: As mentioned earlier, 
the data used for the present work are news cor-
pora—a text genre that has very strong links with 
the time element. The published date of docu-
ment is available in data, and can easily be used 
as an indicator to evaluate the relation between 
two articles in terms of time. Similar to Muntea-
nu’s (2006), we aim to constrain the number of 
candidates by assuming that documents with 
similar content should have publication dates 
which are fairly close to each other, even though 
they reside in two different sets of corpora. By 
imposing this constraint, both the complexity and 
the cost in computation can be reduced tremend-
ously as the number of candidates would be sig-
nificantly reduced. For example, when a 1-day 
window size is set, this means that for a given 
source document, the search for its target candi-
dates is set within 3 days of the source document: 
the same day of publication, the day after, and 
the day before. With this filter, using the data of 
one-month in our experiment, a reduction of 90% 
of all possible alignments can be achieved (sec-
tion 5.1). Moreover, with our evaluation data, 
844
after filtering out document pairs using a 1-day 
window size, up to 81.6% for English-Chinese 
and 80.3% for English-Malay of the golden 
alignments are covered. If the window size is 
increased to 5, the coverage is 96.6% and 95.6% 
for two language pairs respectively. 
Title-n-Content Filter: previous date window 
filter constrains the number of candidates based 
purely on temporal information without exploit-
ing any knowledge of the documents’ contents. 
The number of candidates to be generated is thus 
dependent on the number of published articles 
per day, instead of the candidates’ potential con-
tent similarity. For this reason, we introduce 
another filter which makes use of document titles 
to gauge content-wise cross document similarity. 
As document titles are available in news data, we 
capitalize on words found in these document 
titles, favoring alignment candidates where at 
least one of the title-words in the source docu-
ment has its translation found in the content of 
the other target document. This filter can reduce 
a further 47.9% (English-Chinese) and 26.3% 
(English-Malay) of the remaining alignment can-
didates after applying the date-window filter. 
2.2 Feature Extraction 
The second step extracts all the features for each 
candidate and computes the score for each indi-
vidual feature function. In our model, the feature 
set is composed of the Title-n-Content score 
(???), Linguistic-Independent-Unit score (???), 
and Monolingual Term Distribution similarity 
(???). We will discuss all three features in sec-
tions 3 and 4. 
2.3 Feature Combination 
The final score for each alignment candidate is 
computed by combining all the feature function 
scores into a unique score. In literature, there are 
many methods concerning the estimation of the 
overall score for a given feature set, which vary 
from supervised to unsupervised method. Super-
vised methods such as Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) and Maximum Entropy (ME) estimate 
the weight of each feature based on training data 
which are then used to calculate the final score. 
However, these supervised learning-based me-
thods may not be applicable to our proposed is-
sue as we are motivated to build a language 
independent unsupervised system. We simply 
take a product of all normalized features to ob-
tain one unique score. This is because our fea-
tures are probabilistically independent. In our 
implementation, we normalize the scores to make 
them less sensitive to the absolute value by tak-
ing the logarithm ???. ? as follows: 
 
??????? ? ???
?? ? ??, ? ? ?? ? ??
1, ????
 (1)
 
 
?? ? ?? is a threshold for ? to contribute posi-
tively to the unique score. In our experiment, we 
empirically choose ?  be 2.2 , and the threshold 
for ? is 0.51828 (as ? ? 2.71828). 
3 Monolingual Term Distribution 
3.1 Baseline Model 
The main feature used in Tao and Zhai (2005) is 
the frequency distribution similarity or frequency 
correlation of words in two given corpora. It is 
assumed that frequency distributions of topically-
related words in multilingual comparable corpora 
are often correlated due to the correlated cover-
age of the same events.  
Let ? ? ???, ??, … , ??? and ? ? ???, ??, … , ??? 
be the frequency distribution vectors of two 
words ?  and ?  in two documents respectively. 
The frequency correlation of the two words is 
computed by Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient 
in (2).

The similarity of two documents is calculated 
with the addition of two features namely Inverse 
Document Frequency (???) and 25?? term fre-
quency normalization shown in the equation (3). 
 
 
????, ??? ? ? ?????? · ?????? · ???, ?? ·????,????

Where 25????, ??  is the word frequency 
normalization for word ?  in document? , and 
????????? is the average length of a document. 
 
25????, ?? ? ???

  (4)
 
It is noted that the key feature used by Tao and 
Zhai (2005) is the ???, ?? score which depends 
purely on statistical information. Therefore, our 
motivation is to propose more features to link the 
source and target documents more effectively for 
a better performance.  
3.2 Study on Frequency Correlation 
We further investigate the frequency correlation of 
words from comparable sets of corpora compris-
ing three different languages using the above-
defined model.

Fig 3. Sample of frequency correlation for “Dunia”, “World”, and “??”. 
 
 
Fig 4. Sample of frequency correlation for “Filipina”, “Information Technology”, and “???”. 
 
Using three months - May to July, 2006 – of daily 
newspaper in Strait Times2 (in English), Zao Bao3 
(in Chinese), and Berita Harian4 (in Malay), we 
conduct the experiments described in the follow-
ing Fig 2, Fig 3, and Fig 4 showing three different 
cases of term or word correlation. In these figures, 
the ?-axis denotes time and the ?-axis shows the 
frequency distribution of the term or word.  
Multi-word versus Single-word: Fig 2 
illustrates that the distributions for multi-word 
term such as “World Bank”, “????(World 
Bank in Chinese)”, and “Bank Dunia (World 
Bank in Malay)” in the three language corpora 
are almost similar because of the discriminative 
power of that phrase. The phrase has no variance 
and contains no ambiguity. On the other hand, 
the distributions for single words may have much 
less similarity.

Related Common Word: we also investigate 
the similarity in frequency distribution for related 
common single words in the case of “World”, 
“?? (world in Chinese)”, and “Dunia (world in 
Malay)” as shown in Fig 3. It can be observed 
that the correlation of these common words is not 
as strong as that in the multi-word sample illu-
strated in Fig 2. The reason is that there are many 
variances of these common words, which usually 
do not have high discriminative power due to the 
ambiguities presented within them. Nonetheless, 
among these variances, there is still a small simi-
lar distribution trends that can be detected, which 
may enable us to discover the associations be-
tween them. 
Unrelated Common Word: Fig 4 shows the 
frequency distribution of three unrelated com-
mon words over the same three-month period. 
No correlation in distribution is found among 
them.

3.3 Enhancement from Baseline Model 
3.3.1 Monolingual Term Correlation 
Due to the inadequacy of the baseline’s purely 
statistical approach, and our studies on the corre-
lations of single, multiple and commonly appear-
ing words, we propose using “term” or “multi-
word” instead of “single-word” or “word” to cal-
culate the similarity of term frequency 
distribution between two documents. This 
presents us with two main advantages. Firstly, 
the smaller number of terms compared to the 
number of words present in any document would 
imply fewer possible document alignment pairs 
for the system. This increases the computation 
speed remarkably. To extract automatically the 
list of terms in each document, we use the term 
extraction model from Vu et al. (2008). In corpo-
ra used in our experiments, the average ratios of 
word/term per document are 556/37, 410/28 and 
384/28 for English, Chinese, and Malay respec-
tively. The other advantage of using terms is that 
terms are more distinctive than words as they 
contain less ambiguity, thus enabling high corre-
lation to be observed when compared with single 
words. 
3.3.2 Bilingual Dictionary Incorporation 
In addition to using terms for the computation, 
we observed from equation (3) that the only mu-
tual feature relating the two documents is the 
frequency distribution coefficient ???, ?? . It is 
likely that the alignment performance could be 
enhanced if more features relating the two doc-
uments are incorporated. 
Following that, we introduce a linguistic fea-
ture, ??????????, ?? , to the baseline model to 
enhance the association between two documents. 
This feature involves the comparison of the 
translations of words within a particular term in 
one language, and the presence of these transla-
tions in the corresponding target language term. 
If more translations obtained from a bilingual 
dictionary of words within a term are found in 
the term extracted from the other language’s 
document, it is more likely that the 2 bilingual 
terms are translations of each other. This feature 
counts the number of word translation found be-
tween the two terms, as described in the follow-
ing. Let ??  and ??  be the term list of ??  and ?? 
respectively, the similarity score in our model is: 
???????, ??? ? ? ?????? · ?????? · ???, ?? ·????,????
??????????, ?? · 25????, ??? · 25????, ???
(5) 
3.3.3 Distribution Similarity Measurement 
using Monolingual Term 
Finally, we apply the results of time-series re-
search to replace Pearson’s correlation which is 
used in the baseline model, in our calculation of 
the similarity score of two frequency distribu-
tions. A popular technique for time sequence 
matching is to use Discrete Fourier Transform 
(??? ) (Agrawal et al, 1993). More recently, 
Klementiev and Roth (2006) also use F-index 
(Hetland, 2004), a score using ???, to calculate 
the time distribution similarity. In our model, we 
assume that the frequency chain of a word is a 
sequence, and calculate ???  score for each 
chain by the following formula: 
?? ? ???. ?
?????
??
???
 (6)
In time series research, it is proven that only 
the first few ?  coefficients of a ???  chain are 
strong and important for comparison (Agrawal et 
al, 1993). Our experiments in section 5 show that 
the best value for ? is 7 for both language pairs. 
???, ?? ?
?
??????? ? ????
?
?
???
?
?
??
 (7)
The ???, ??  in equation (5) is replaced by 
???, ?? in equation (8) to calculate the Monolin-
gual Term Distribution (???) score. 
4 Document Relationship Heuristics 
Besides the ???, we also propose two heuristic-
based features that focus directly on the 
relationship between two multilingual documents, 
namely the Title-n-Content score? ??? , which 
measures the relationship between the title and 
content of a document pair, and Linguistic Inde-
pendent Unit score – ??? , which make use of 
orthographic similarity between unit of words for 
the different languages.  
4.1 Title-n-Content Score (???) 
Besides being a filter for removing bad align-
ment candidates, ???  is also incorporated as a 
feature in the computation of document align-
ment score. In the corpora used, in most docu-
ments, “title” does reveal the main topic of a 
document. The use of words in a news title is 
???????, ??? ? ? ?????? · ??????
????,????
· ???, ?? · ??????????, ??
· 25????, ??? · 25????, ??? 
(8)
847
typically concise and conveys the essence of the 
information in the document. Thus, a high ??? 
score would indicate a high likelihood of similar-
ity between two bilingual documents. Therefore, 
we use ??? as a quantitative feature in our fea-
ture set. Function ????, ?? checks whether the 
translation of a word in a document’s title is 
found in the content of its aligned document: 
 
????, ?? ? ?1,     translation of ? is in ?0,     else                                (9)
 
The ??? score of document ??  and ??  is cal-
culated by the following formula: 
 
??????, ??? ? 
? ?????, ???
???T?
? ? ?????, ???
???T?
 (10)
Where ??  and ??  are the content of document 
?? and ??; and ?? and ?? are the set of title words 
of two documents. 
In addition, this method speeds up the align-
ment process without compromising perfor-
mance when compared with the calculation 
based only on contents on both sides. 
4.2 Linguistic Independent Unit (???) 
Linguistic Independent Unit score (LIU) is de-
fined as the piece of information, which is writ-
ten in the same way for different languages. The 
following highlight the number 25, 11, and 50 as 
linguistic-independent-units for the two sen-
tences. 
English: Between Feb 25 and March 11 this 
year, she used counterfeit $50 notes 10 times to 
pay taxi fares ranging from $2.50 to $4.20. 
Chinese:????????????? 2 ?

5 Experiment and Evaluation 
5.1 Experimental Setup 
The experiments were conducted on two sets of 
comparable corpora namely English-Chinese and 
English-Malay. The data are from three news 
publications in Singapore: the Strait Times (ST, 
English), Lian He Zao Bao (ZB, Chinese), and 
Berita Harian (BH, Malay). Since these languag-
es are from different language families 5 , our 
model can be considered as language indepen-
dent. 
                                                          
5 English is in Indo-European; Chinese is in Sino-Tibetan; 
Malay is in Austronesian family [Wikipedia]. 
The evaluation is conducted based on a set of 
manually aligned documents prepared by a group 
of bilingual students. It is done by carefully read-
ing through each article in the month of June 
(2006) for both sets of corpora and trying to find 
articles of similar content in the other language 
within the given time window. Alignment is 
based on similarity of content where the same 
story or event is mentioned. Any two bilingual 
articles with at least 50% content overlapping are 
considered as comparable. This set of reference 
data is cross-validated between annotators. Table 
1 shows the statistics of our reference data for 
document alignment. 
 
Language pair ST – ZB ST – BH 
Distinct source 396 176
Distinct target 437 175
Total alignments 438 183
Table 1. Statistics on evaluation data. 
 
Note that although there are 438 alignments 
for ST-ZB, the number of unique ST articles are 
396, implying that the mapping is not one-to-one. 
5.2 Evaluation Metrics 
Evaluation is performed on two levels to reflect 
performance from two different perspectives. 
“Macro evaluation” is conducted to assess the 
correctness of the alignment candidates given 
their rank among all the alignment candidates. 
“Micro evaluation” concerns about the correctness 
of the aligned documents returned for a given 
source document. 
Macro evaluation: we present the perfor-
mance for macro evaluation using average preci-
sion. It is used to evaluate the performance of a 
ranked list and gives higher score for the list that 
returns more correct alignment in the top. 
Micro evaluation: for micro evaluation, we 
evaluate the F-Score, calculated from recall and 
precision, based on the number of correct align-
ments for the top of alignment candidates for 
each source document. 
5.3 Experiment and Result 
First we implement the method of Tao and Zhai 
(2005) as the baseline. Basically, this method 
does not depend on any linguistic resources and 
calculates the similarity between two documents 
purely by comparing all possible pairs of words. 
In addition to this, we also implement Muntea-
nu’s (2006) method which uses Okapi scoring 
function from the Lemur Toolkit (Ogilvie and 
848
Callan, 2001) to obtain the similarity score. This 
approach relies heavily on bilingual dictionaries. 
To assess performances more fairly, the result 
from baseline method of Tao and Zhai are com-
pared against the results of the following list of 
incremental approaches: the baseline (A); the 
baseline using term instead of word (B); replac-
ing ???, ?? by ???, ?? for ??? feature, with and 
without bilingual dictionaries in (C) and (D) re-
spectively; and including ???  and ???  for our 
final model in (E). Our model is also compared 
our model with results from the implementation 
of Munteanu (2006) using Okapi (F), and the 
results from a combination of our model with 
Okapi (G). Table 2 and Table 3 show the expe-
rimental results for two language pairs English – 
Chinese (ST-ZB) and English – Malay (ST-BH), 
respectively. Each row displays the result of each 
experiment at a certain cut-off among the top 
returned alignments. The “Top” columns reflect 
the cut-off threshold. 
The first three cases (A), (B) and (C), which 
do not rely on linguistic resources, suggest that 
our new features lead to better performance im-
provement over the baseline. It can be seen that 
the use of term and ??? significantly improves 
the performance. The improvement indicated by 
a sharp increase in all cases from (C) to (D) 
shows that dictionaries can indeed help ??? fea-
tures. 
Based on the result of (E), our final model 
significantly outperforms the model of Munteanu  
(F) in both macro and micro evaluation. It is 
noted that our features rely less heavily on dic-
tionaries as it only makes use of this resource to 
translate term words and title words of a docu-
ment while Munteanu (2006) needs to translate 
entire documents, exclude stopword, and relying 
on an IR system. It is also observed that the per-
formance of (G) shows that although the incor-
poration of Okapi score in our final model (E) 
improves the average precision performance of 
ST-ZB slightly, it does not appear to be helpful 
for our ST-BH data. However, Okapi does help 
in the F-Measure on both corpora.

5.4 Discussion 
It can be seen from Table 2 and Table 3 that by 
exploiting the frequency distribution of terms 
using Discrete Fourier Transform instead of 
words on Pearson’s Correlation, performance is 
noticeably improved. Fig 5 shows the incremen-
tal improvement of our model for top-200 and 
top-2 alignments using macro and micro evalua-
tion respectively. The sharp increase can be seen 
in Fig 5 from point (C) onwards.

and top-2 for micro evaluation. 
Fig 6 compares the performance of our system 
with Tao and Zhai (2005) and Munteanu (2006). 
It is shown that our systems outperform these 
two systems under the same experimental 
parameters. Moreover, even without the use of 
dictionaries, our system’s performance on ST-
BH data is much better than Munteanu’s (2006) 
on the same data.

top-500 for macro and top-5 for micro evaluation. 
 
We find that dictionary usage contributes 
much more to performance improvement in ST-
BH compared to that in ST-ZB. We attribute this 
to the fact that the feature LIU already contri-
butes markedly to the increase in the perfor-
mance of ST-BH. As a result, it is harder to make 
further improvements even with the application 
of bilingual dictionaries. 
6 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we propose a feature based model 
for aligning documents from multilingual com-
parable corpora. Our feature set is selected based 
on the need for a method to be adaptable to new 
language-pairs without relying heavily on lin-
guistic resources, unsupervised learning strategy. 
Thus, in the proposed method we make use of 
simple bilingual dictionaries, which are rather 
inexpensive and easily obtained nowadays. We 
also explore diverse features, including Mono-
lingual Term Distribution (??? ), Title-and-
Content (???), and Linguistic Independent Unit 
(???) and measure their contributions in an in-
cremental way. The experiment results show that 
our system can retrieve similar documents from 
two comparable corpora much better than using 
an information retrieval, such as that used by 
Munteanu (2006). It also performs better than a 
word correlation-based method such as Tao’s 
(2005). 
Besides document alignment as an end, there 
are many tasks that can directly benefit from 
comparable corpora with documents that are 
well-aligned. These include sentence alignment, 
term alignment, and machine translation, espe-
cially statistical machine translation. In the future, 
we aim to extract other valuable information 
from comparable corpora which benefits from 
comparable documents.
