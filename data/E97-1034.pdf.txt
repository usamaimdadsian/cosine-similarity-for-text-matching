Abstract 
In this paper, we argue for the need to dis- 
tinguish between task and dialogue initiatives, 
and present a model for tracking shifts in both 
types of initiatives in dialogue interactions. 
Our model predicts the initiative holders in the 
next dialogue turn based on the current initia- 
tive holders and the effect that observed cues 
have on changing them. Our evaluation across 
various corpora shows that he use of cues con- 
sistently improves the accuracy in the system' s 
prediction of task and dialogue initiative hold- 
ers by 2-4 and 8-13 percentage points, respec- 
tively, thus illustrating the generality of our 
model. 
1 Introduction 
Naturally-occurring collaborative dialogues are very 
rarely, if ever, one-sided. Instead, initiative of the in- 
teraction shifts among participants in a primarily princi- 
pled fashion, signaled by features uch as linguistic ues, 
prosodic ues and, in face-to-face interactions, eye gaze 
aad gestures. Thus, for a dialogue system to interact with 
its user in a natural and coherent manner, it must recog- 
nize the user's cues for initiative shifts and provide ap- 
propriate cues in its responses to user utterances. 
Previous work on mixed-initiative dialogues focused 
on tracking asingle thread of control among participants. 
We argue that this view of initiative fails to distinguish 
between task initiative and dialogue initiative, which to- 
gether determine when and how an agent will address 
an issue. Although physical cues, such as gestures and 
eye gaze, play an important role in coordinating initia- 
tive shifts in face-to-face interactions, a great deal of 
information regarding initiative shifts can be extracted 
from utterances based on linguistic and domain knowl- 
edge alone. By taking into account such cues during dia- 
logue interactions, the system is better able to determine 
the task and dialogue initiative holders for each turn and 
to tailor its response to user utterances accordingly. 
In this paper, we show how distinguishing between 
task and dialogue initiatives accounts for phenomena in
collaborative dialogues that previous models were unable 
to explain. We show that a set of cues, which can be 
recognized based on linguistic and domain knowledge 
alone, can be utilized by a model for tracking initiative 
to predict the task and dialogue initiative holders with 
99.1% and 87.8% accuracies, respectively, in collabo- 
rative planning dialogues. Furthermore, application of 
our model to dialogues in various other collaborative en- 
vironments consistently increases the accuracies in the 
prediction of task and dialogue initiative holders by 2-4 
and 8-13 percentage points, respectively, compared to a 
simple prediction method without he use of cues, thus 
illustrating the generality of our model. 
2 Task  In i t ia t ive  vs. Dialogue Initiative 
2.1 Motivation 
Previous work on mixed-initiative dialogues focused on 
tracking and allocating a single thread of control, the 
conversational lead, among participants. Novick (1988) 
developed a computational model that utilizes meta- 
locutionary acts, such as repeat and give-turn, to cap- 
ture mixed-initiative behavior in dialogues. Whittaker 
and Stenton (1988) devised rules for allocating dialogue 
control based on utterance types, and Walker and Whit- 
taker (1990) utilized these rules for an analytical study 
on discourse segmentation. Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema 
(1991) developed a plan-based ialogue understanding 
model that tracks the conversational initiative based on 
the domain and discourse plans behind the utterances. 
Smith and Hipp (1994) developed a dialogue system that 
varies its responses to user utterances based on four di= 
alogue modes which model different levels of initiative 
exhibited by dialogue participants. However, the dia- 
logue mode is determined at the outset and cannot be 
changed uring the dialogue. Guinn (1996) subsequently 
developed a system that allows change in the level of ini- 
262 
tiative based on initiative-changing utterances and each 
agent's competency in completing the current subtask. 
However, we contend that merely maintaining the con- 
versational lead is insufficient for modeling complex be- 
havior commonly found in naturally-occurring collabo- 
rative dialogues (SRI Transcripts, 1992; Gross, Allen, 
and Tram, 1993; Heeman and Allen, 1995). For in- 
stance, consider the alternative responses in utterances 
(3a)-(3c), given by an advisor to a student's question: 
(1) S: I want to take NLP to satisfy my seminar 
course requirement. 
(2) Who is teaching NLP? 
(3a) A: Dr. Smith is teaching NLP. 
(3b) A: You can't take NLP because you haven't 
taken AI, which is a prerequisite for NLP 
(3c) A: You can't take NLP because you haven't 
taken AI, which is a prerequisite for NLP 
You should take distributed programming 
to satisfy your requirement, and sign up 
as a listener for NI.~. 
Suppose we adopt a model that maintains a single 
thread of control, such as that of (Whittaker and Stenton, 
1988). In utterance (3a), A directly responds to S's ques- 
tion; thus the conversational lead remains with S. On the 
other hand, in (3b) and (3c), A takes the lead by initiating 
a subdialogue to correct S's invalid proposal. However, 
existing models cannot explain the difference in the two 
responses, namely that in (3c), A actively participates in
the planning process by explicitly proposing domain ac- 
tions, whereas in (3b), she merely conveys the invalid- 
ity of S's proposal. Based on this observation, we argue 
that it is necessary to distinguish between task initiative, 
which tracks the lead in the development of the agents' 
plan, and dialogue initiative, which tracks the lead in de- 
termining the current discourse focus (Chu-Carroll and 
Brown, 1997). 1This distinction then allows us to explain 
• ~/s behavior from a response generation point of view: in 
(3b), A responds to S's proposal by merely taking over 
the dialogue initiative, i.e., informing S of the invalidity 
of the proposal, while in (3c), A responds by taking over 
both the task and dialogue initiatives, i.e., informing S of 
the invalidity and suggesting a possible remedy. 
An agent is said to have the task initiative if she is 
directing how the agents' task should be accomplished, 
i.e., if her utterances directly propose actions that the 
1Although independently conceived, this distinction be- 
tween task and dialogue initiatives i similar to the notion of 
choice of task and choice of speaker in initiative in (Novick 
and Sutton, 1997), and the distinction between control and ini- 
tiative in (Jordan and Di Eugenio, 1997).

agents should perform. The utterances may propose 
domain actions (Litman and Allen, 1987) that directly 
contribute to achieving the agents' goal, such as "Let's 
send engine E2 to Coming." On the other hand, they 
may propose problem-solving actions (Allen, 1991; 
Lambert and Carberry, 1991; Ramshaw, 1991) that con- 
tribute not directly to the agents' domain goal, but to how 
they would go about achieving this goal, such as "Let's 
look at the first \[problem\]first." An agent is said to have 
the dialogue initiative if she takes the conversational 
lead in order to establish mutual beliefs, such as mutual 
beliefs about a piece of domain knowledge or about he 
validity of a proposal, between the agents. For instance, 
in responding to agent Xs proposal of sending a boxcar 
to Coming via Dansville, agent B may take over the dia- 
logue initiative (but not the task initiative) by saying "We 
can't go by Dansville because we've got Engine I going 
on that track." Thus, when an agent akes over the task 
initiative, she also takes over the dialogue initiative, since 
a proposal of actions can be viewed as an attempt to es- 
tablish the mutual belief that a set of actions be adopted. 
On the other hand, an agent may take over the dialogue 
initiative but not the task initiative, as in (3b) above. 
2.2 An Analysis of the TRAINS91 Dialogues 
To analyze the distribution of task/dialogue initiatives 
in collaborative planning dialogues, we annotated the 
TRAINS91 dialogues (Gross, Allen, and Traum, 1993) 
as follows: each dialogue turn is given two labels, task 
initiative (TI) and dialogue initiative (DI), each of which 
can be assigned one of two values, system or manager, 
depending on which agent holds the task/dialogue initia- 
tive during that turn. 2 
Table 1 shows the distribution of task and dialogue ini- 
tiatives in the TRAINS91 dialogues. It shows that while 
in the majority of turns, the task and dialogue initiatives 
are held by the same agent, in approximately 1/4 of the 
turns, the agents' behavior can be better accounted forby 
tracking the two types of initiatives eparately. 
To assess the reliability of our annotations, approxi- 
mately 10% of the dialogues were annotated by two ad- 
ditional coders. We then used the kappa statistic (Siegel 
and Castellan, 1988; Carletta, 1996) to assess the level of 
agreement between the three coders with respect o the

263 
task and dialogue initiative holders. In this experiment, 
K is 0,57 for the task initiative holder agreement and K 
is 0.69 for the dialogue initiative holder agreement. 
Carletta suggests that content analysis researchers 
consider K >.8 as good reliability, with .67< /~" <.8 
allowing tentative conclusions to be drawn (Carletta, 
1996). Strictly based on this metric, our results indicate 
that the three coders have a reasonable l vel of agree- 
ment with respect o the dialogue initiative holders, but 
do not have reliable agreement with respect to the task 
initiative holders. However, the kappa statistic is known 
to be highly problematic n measuring inter-coder reli- 
ability when the likelihood of one category being cho- 
sen overwhelms that of the other (Grove et al., 1981), 
which is the case for the task initiative distribution i  the 
TRAINS91 corpus, as shown in Table 1. Furthermore, as 
will be shown in Table 4, Section 4, the task and dialogue 
initiative distributions in TRAINS91 are not at all repre- 
sentative of collaborative dialogues. We expect hat by 
taking a sample of dialogues whose task/dialogue initia- 
tive distributions are more representative of all dialogues, 
we will lower the value of P(E), the probability of chance 
agreement, and thus obtain a higher kappa coefficient of 
agreement. However, we leave selecting and annotating 
such a subset of representative dialogues for future work. 
3 A Model for Tracking Initiative 
Our analysis hows that the task and dialogue initiatives 
shift between the participants during the course of a di- 
alogue. We contend that it is important for the agents 
to take into account signals for such initiative shifts for 
two reasons. First, recognizing and providing signals 
for initiative shifts allow the agents to better coordinate 
their actions, thus leading to more coherent and cooper- 
ative dialogues. Second, by determining whether or not 
it should hold the task and/or dialogue initiatives when 
responding to user utterances, a dialogue system is able 
to tailor its responses based on the distribution of initia- 
tives, as illustrated by the previous dialogue (Chu-Carroll 
and Brown, 1997). This section describes our model for 
tracking initiative using cues identified from the user's 
utterances. 
Our model maintains, for each agent, a task initiative 
index and a dialogue initiative index which measure the 
amount of evidence available to support he agent hold- 
ing the task and dialogue initiatives, respectively. After 
each turn, new initiative indices are calculated based on 
the current indices and the effects of the cues observed 
during the turn. These cues may be explicit requests by 
the speaker to give up his initiative, or implicit cues such 
as ambiguous proposals. The new initiative indices then 
determine the initiative holders for the next turn. 
We adopt the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence 
(Sharer, 1976; Gordon and Shortliffe, 1984) as our un- 
derlying model for inferring the accumulated effect of 
multiple cues on determining the initiative indices. The 
Dempster-Shafer theory is a mathematical theory for rea- 
soning under uncertainty which operates over a set of 
possible outcomes, O. Associated with each piece of 
evidence that may provide support for the possible out- 
comes is a basic probability assignment (bpa), a func- 
tion that represents he impact of the piece of evidence 
on the subsets of O. A bpa assigns anumber in the range 
\[0,1\] to each subset of O such that the numbers um to 1. 
The number assigned to the subset O1 then denotes the 
amount of support the evidence directly provides for the 
conclusions represented by O1. When multiple pieces 
of evidence are present, Dempster' s combination rule is 
used to compute a new bpa from the individual bpa' s to 
represent their cumulative ffect. 
The reasons for selecting the Dempster-Shafer theory 
as the basis for our model are twofold. First, unlike 
the Bayesian model, it does not require a complete set 
of a priori and conditional probabilities, which is dif- 
ficult to obtain for sparse pieces of evidence. Second, 
the Dempster-Shafer theory distinguishes between situ- 
ations in which no evidence is available to support any 
conclusion and those in which equal evidence is avail- 
able to support each conclusion. Thus the outcome of 
the model more accurately represents he amount of ev- 
idence available to support a particular conclusion, i.e., 
the provability of the conclusion (Pearl, 1990). 
3.1 Cues for Tracking Initiative 
In order to utilize the Dempster-Shafer theory for mod- 
eling initiative, we must first identify the cues that pro- 
vide evidence for initiative shifts. Whittaker, Stenton, 
and Walker (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and 
Whittaker, 1990) have previously identified a set of ut- 
terance intentions that serve as cues to indicate shifts or 
lack of shifts in initiative, such as prompts and questions. 
We analyzed our annotated TRAINS91 corpus and iden- 
tified additional cues that may have contributed to the 
shift or lack of shift in task/dialogue initiatives during 
the interactions. This results in eight cue types, which are 
grouped into three classes, based on the kind of knowl- 
edge needed to recognize them. Table 2 shows the three 
classes, the eight cue types, their subtypes if any, whether 
a cue may affect merely the dialogue initiative or both 
the task and dialogue initiatives, and the agent expected 
to hold the initiative in the next turn. 
The first cue class, explicit cues, includes explicit re- 
quests by the speaker to give up or take over the initiative. 
For instance, the utterance "Any suggestions ?" indicates 
the speaker's intention for the hearer to take over both 
the task and dialogue initiatives. Such explicit cues can 
be recognized by inferring the discourse and/or problem- 
solving intentions conveyed by the speaker' s utterances.

Table 2: Cues for Modeling Initiative 
The second cue class, discourse cues, includes cues 
that can be recognized using linguistic and discourse in- 
formation, such as from the surface form of an utterance, 
or from the discourse relationship between the current 
and prior utterances. It consists of four cue types. The 
first type is perceptible silence at the end of an utterance, 
which suggests that the speaker has nothing more to say 
and may intend to give up her initiative. The second type 
includes utterances that do not contribute information 
that has not been conveyed earlier in the dialogue. It can 
be further classified into two groups: repetitions, a sub- 
set of the informationally redundant utterances (Walker, 
1992), in which the speaker paraphrases an utterance 
by the hearer or repeats the utterance verbatim, and 
prompts, in which the speaker merely acknowledges the 
bearer's previous utterance(s). Repetitions and prompts 
also suggest that the speaker has nothing more to say and 
indicate that the hearer should take over the initiative 
(Whittaker and Stenton, 1988). The third type includes 
questions which, based on anticipated responses, are 
divided into domain and evaluation questions. Domain 
questions are questions in which the speaker intends 
to obtain or verify a piece of domain knowledge. 
They usually merely require a direct response and thus 
typically do not result in an initiative shift. Evaluation 
questions, on the other hand, are questions in which the 
speaker intends to assess the quality of a proposed plan. 
They often require an analysis of the proposal, and thus 
frequently result in a shift in dialogue initiative. The 
final type includes utterances that satisfy an outstanding 
task or discourse obligation. Such obligations may have 
resulted from a prior request by the hearer, or from an 
interruption initiated by the speaker himself. In either 
case, when the task/dialogue obligation is fulfilled, the 
initiative may be reverted back to the hearer who held 
the initiative prior to the request or interruption. 
The third cue class, analytical cues, includes cues 
that cannot be recognized without the hearer perform- 
ing an evaluation on the speaker's proposal using the 
heater's private knowledge (Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 
1994; Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995). After the eval- 
uation, the hearer may find the proposal invalid, subop- 
timal, or ambiguous. As a result, he may initiate a sub- 
dialogue to resolve the problem, resulting in a shift in 
task/dialogue initiatives. 3 
3 Whittaker, Stenton, and Walker treat subdialogues initiated 
as a result of these cues as interruptions, motivated by their col- 
laborative planning principles (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; 
Walker and Whittaker, 1990). 
265 
3.2 Utilizing the Dempster-Shafer Theory 
As discussed earlier, at the end of each turn, new 
task/dialogue initiative indices are computed based on 
the current indices and the effect of the observed cues 
to determine the next task/dialogue initiative holders. In 
terms of the Dempster-Shafer theory, new task/dialogue 
bpa's (mt_new/md_netu)  4 are computed by applying 
Dempster's combination rule to the bpa's representing 
the current initiative indices ~ and the bpa of each 
observed cue. 
Evidently, some cues provide stronger evidence for 
an initiative shift than others. Furthermore, a cue may 
provide stronger support for a shift in dialogue initiative 
than in task initiative. Thus, we associate with each cue 
two bpa' s to represent i s effect on changing the current 
task and dialogue initiative indices, respectively. We ex- 
tended our annotations of the TRAINS91 dialogues to 
include, in addition to the agent(s) holding the task and 
dialogue initiatives for each turn, a list of cues observed 
during that turn. Initially, each cue~ is assigned the fol- 
lowing bpa's: mt- i (O)  ~- I and ma-i(@) = 1, where 
@ = {speaker,hearer}. In other words, we assume that 
the cue has no effect on changing the current initiative 
indices. We then developed a training algorithm (Train- 
bpa, Figure 1) and applied it on the annotated ata to 
obtain the final bpa' s. 
For each turn, the task and dialogue bpa's for each 
observed cue are used, along with the current initiative 
indices, to determine the new initiative indices (step 2). 
The combine function utilizes Dempster's combination 
rule to combine pairs of bpa' suntil a final bpa is obtained 
to represent the cumulative ffect of the given bpa' s. The 
resulting bpa's are then used to predict he task/dialogue 
initiative holders for the next turn (step 3). If this pre- 
diction disagrees with the actual value in the annotated 
data, Adjust-bpa is invoked to alter the bpa' s for the ob- 
served cues, and Reset-current-bpa is invoked to ad- 
just the current bpa' s to reflect he actual initiative holder 
(step 4). 
Adjust-bpa adjusts the bpa's for the observed cues 
in favor of the actual initiative holder. We developed 
three adjustment methods by varying the effect that a 
disagreement between the actual and predicted initiative 
holders will have on changing the bpa' s for the observed 
cues. The first is constant- increment where each time a 
disagreement occurs, the value for the actual initiative 
holder in the bpa is incremented by a constant (A), while 
4Bpa's are represented by functions whose names take the 
form of m,~,b. The subscript sub may be t-X or d-X, indicat- 
ing that the function represents he task or dialogue bpa under 
scenario X. 
SThe initiative indices are represented as bpa's. For in- 
stance, the current ask initiative indices take the following 
form: rat . . . .  (speaker) = z and rat . . . .  (hearer) = 1 - z.

constant- increment-with-counter,  associates with each 
bpa for each cue a counter which is incremented when 
a correct prediction is made, and decremented when an 
incorrect prediction is made. If the counter is nega- 
tive, the constant- increment method is invoked, and the 
counter is reset o 0. This method ensures that a bpa will 
only be adjusted if it has no "credit" for correct predic- 
tions in the past. The third method, variable- increment- 
with-counter ,  is a variation of constant- increment-with-  
counter. However, instead of determining whether an 
adjustment is needed, the counter determines the amount 
to be adjusted. Each time the system makes an incorrect 
prediction, the value for the actual initiative holder is in- 
cremented by A /2  c°'`'~+z, and that for O decremented

In addition to experimenting with different adjustment 
methods, we also varied the increment constant, A. For 
each adjustment method, we ran 19 training sessions 
with A ranging from 0.025 to 0.475, incrementing by 
0.025 between each session, and evaluated the system 
based on its accuracy in predicting the initiative holders 
for each turn. We divided the TRAINS91 corpus into 
eight sets based on speaker/hearer pairs. For each A, 
we cross-validated the results by applying the training 
algorithm to seven dialogue sets and testing the resulting 
bpa' s on the remaining set. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show 
our system's performance in predicting the task and dia- 
logue initiative holders, respectively, using the three ad- 
justment methods. 6 
3.3 Discussion 
Figure 2 shows that in the vast majority of cases, our 
prediction methods yield better esults than making pre- 
dictions without cues. Furthermore, substantial improve- 
ment is gained by the use of counters ince they prevent 
the effect of the "exceptions of the rules" from accu- 
mulating and resulting in erroneous predictions. By re- 
stricting the increment to be inversely exponentially re- 
lated to the "credit" the bpa had in making correct pre- 
dictions, variable-increment-with-counter obtains bet- 
ter and more consistent results than constant-increment. 
However, the exceptions of the rules still resulted in un- 
desirable ffects, thus the further improved performance 
by constant-increment-with-counter. 
We analyzed the cases in which the system, using

tem's performance without he use of cues, i.e., always predict 
that he initiative remains with the current holder. 
constant-increment-with-counter with A = .35, 7 made 
erroneous predictions. Tables 3(a) and 3(b) summarize 
the results of our analysis with respect o task and di- 
alogue initiatives, respectively. For each cue type, we 
grouped the errors based on whether or not a shift oc- 
curred in the actual dialogue. For instance, the first row 
in Table 3(a) shows that when the cue invalid action is 
detected, the system failed to predict a task initiative shift 
in 2 out of 3 cases. On the other hand, it correctly pre- 
dicted all 11 cases where no shift in task initiative oc- 
curred. Table 3(a) also shows that when an analytical 
cue is detected, the system correctly predicted all but one 
case in which there was no shift in task initiative. How- 
ever, 55% of the time, the system failed to predict a shift 
in task initiative, s This suggests that other features need 
to be taken into account when evaluating user proposals 
in order to more accurately model initiative shifts result- 
ing from such cues. Similar observations can be made 
about the errors in predicting dialogue initiative shifts 
when analytical cues are observed (Table 3(b)). 
Table 3(b) shows that when a perceptible silence is 
detected at the end of an utterance, when the speaker 
utters a prompt, or when an outstanding discourse 
obligation is fulfilled (first three rows in table), the 
system correctly predicted the dialogue initiative holder 
in the vast majority of cases. However, for the cue class 
questions, when the actual initiative shift differs from 
the norm, i.e., speaker etaining initiative for evaluation 
questions and hearer taking over initiative for domain 
questions, the system's performance worsens. In the 
rThis is the value that yields the optimal results (Figure 2). 
sin the case of suboptimal ctions, we encounter the sparse 
data problem. Since there is only one instance of the cue in the 
set of dialogues, when the cue is present in the testing set, it is 
absent from the training set.

Table 3: Summary of Prediction Errors 
case of domain questions, errors occur when 1) the re- 
sponse requires more reasoning than do typical domain 
questions, causing the hearer to take over the dialogue 
initiative, or 2) the hearer, instead of merely responding 
to the question, offers additional helpful information. 
In the case of evaluation questions, errors occur when 
1) the result of the evaluation is readily available to the 
hearer, thus eliminating the need for an initiative shift, 
or 2) the hearer provides extra information. We believe 
that although it is difficult to predict when an agent 
may include extra information in response to a question, 
taking into account he cognitive load that a question 
places on the hearer may allow us to more accurately 
predict dialogue initiative shifts. 
4 Applications in Other Environments 
TO investigate the generality of our system, we applied 
our training algorithm, using the constant-increment- 
with-counter adjustment method with A = 0.35, on 
the TRAINS91 corpus to obtain a set of bpa's. We 
then evaluated the system on subsets of dialogues from 
four other corpora: the TRAINS93 dialogues (Heeman 
and Allen, 1995), airline reservation dialogues (SRI 
Transcripts, 1992), instruction-giving dialogues (Map 
Task Dialogues, 1996), and non-task-oriented dialogues 
(Switchboard Credit Card Corpus, 1992). In addition, we 
applied our baseline strategy which makes predictions 
without he use of cues to each corpus. 
Table 4 shows a comparison between the dialogues 
from the five corpora and the results of this evaluation. 
Row I in the table shows the number of turns where the 
expert 9 holds the task/dialogue initiative, with percent- 
ages shown in parentheses. This analysis hows that me 
distribution of initiatives varies quite significantly across 
corpora, with the distribution biased toward one agent in 
the TRAINS and maptask corpora, and split fairly evenly 
in the airline and switchboard ialogues. Row 2 shows 
the results of applying our baseline prediction method 
to the various corpora. The numbers hown are correct 
predictions in each instance, with the corresponding 
percentages shown in parentheses. These results indicate 
the difficulty of the prediction problem in each corpus 
that the task/dialogue initiative distribution (row 1) 
falls to convey. For instance, although the dialogue 
initiative is distributed approximately 30/70% between 
the two agents in the TRAINS91 corpus and 40160% 
in the airline dialogues, the prediction rates in row 2 
shows that in both cases, the distribution is the result of 
shifts in dialogue initiative in approximately 25% of the 
dialogue turns. Row 3 in the table shows the prediction 
results when applying our training algorithm using 
the constant-increment-with-counter method. Finally, 
the last row shows the improvement in percentage 
points between our prediction method and the baseline 
9The expertis assigned as follows: in the TRAINS domain, 
the system; in the airline domain, the travel agent; in the map- 
task domain, the instruction giver; and in the switchboard ia- 
logues, the agent who holds the dialogue initiative the majority 
of the time.

prediction method. To test the statistical significance 
of the differences between the results obtained by the 
two prediction algorithms, for each corpus, we applied 
Cochran' s Q test (Cochran, 1950) to the results in rows 2 
and 3. The tests how that for all corpora, the differences 
between the two algorithms when predicting the task and 
dialogue initiative holders are statistically significant at 
the levels of p<0.05 and p< 10 -5, respectively. 
Based on the results of our evaluation, we make the 
following observations. First, Table 4 illustrates the gen- 
erality of our prediction mechanism. Although the sys- 
tem's performance varies across environments, the use 
of cues consistently improves the system's accuracies in 
predicting the task and dialogue initiative holders by 2- 
4 percentage points (with the exception of the maptask 
corpus in which there is no room for improvement) TM 
and 8-13 percentage points, respectively. Second, Ta- 
ble 4 shows the specificity of the trained bpa's with re- 
spect to application environments. Using our predic- 
tion mechanism, the system's performances on the col- 
laborative planning dialogues (TRAINS91, TRAINS93, 
and airline reservation) most closely resemble one an- 
other (last row in table). This suggests that the bpa's 
may be somewhat sensitive to application environments 
since they may affect how agents interpret cues. Third, 
our prediction mechanism yields better esults on task- 
oriented ialogues. This is because such dialogues are 
constrained by the goals; therefore, there are fewer di- 
gressions and offers of unsolicited opinion as compared 
to the switchboard corpus. 
5 Conclusions 
This paper discussed a model for tracking initiative be- 
tween participants in mixed-initiative dialogue interac- 
tions. We showed that distinguishing between task and 
dialogue initiatives allows us to model phenomena in col- 
laborative dialogues that existing systems are unable to 
explain. We presented eight types of cues that affect ini- 
tiative shifts in dialogues, and showed how our model 
1°In the maptask domain, the task initiative remains with one 
agent, the instruction giver, throughout the dialogue. 
predicts initiative shifts based on the current initiative 
holders and and the effects that observed cues have on 
changing them. Our experiments show that by utilizing 
the constant-increment-with-counter adjustment method 
in determining the basic probability assignments for each 
cue, the system can correctly predict he task and dia- 
logue initiative holders 99.1% and 87.8% of the time, re- 
spectively, in the TRAINS91 corpus, compared to 96.8% 
and 74.9% without he use of cues. The differences be- 
tween these results are shown to be statistically signif- 
icant using Cochran's Q test. In addition, we demon- 
strated the generality of our model by applying it to dia- 
logues in different application environments. The results 
indicate that although the basic probability assignments 
may be sensitive to application environments, the use of 
cues in the prediction process ignificantly improves the 
system' s performance.
