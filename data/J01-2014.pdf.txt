"MIT CogNet is an important new venture that brings together many 
different resources for the cognitive and brain sciences. By bringing 
information directly to researchers and students and allowing rapid 
dissemination of important new research directions, CogNet by- 
passes the slow and expensive efforts in the commercial publishing 
world. A new model for how scientifiCoPUblishing will look in the 
twenty-first century is already being tested today in CogNet~'

BENEFITS, PAYMENT AND ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS 
Please immediately notify the ACL Office of address and email changes. Journal copies returned due to bad 
addresses will not be remailed until a $5.00 postage/handling fee is remitted. E-mail (if available) is used to 
distribute meeting, membership, and other announcements. 
MEMBERSHIP in the Association for Computational Linguistics is for the calendar year, regardless of when dues 
are paid. Membership includes a full year of the ACL journal, Computational Linguistics, reduced registration at 
most ACL-sponsored conferences, and discounts on ACL-sponsored publications. Payments for membership dues, 
fund donations, back issues, and proceedings may be made in Europe or the USA. Important Note: Renewals must 
be received no later than 1 April 2001 to avoid late payment fee (for postage/handling) assessment. Membership 
categories include Regular Members (for 1, 3 or 5 years) and the following: Couples with the same mailing address 
may be Joint Members (for 1, 3, or 5 years); they will receive only one set of publications, but each will be eligible 
for all other member benefits. Students taking a full-time program of courses and not earning a regular income may 
become Student Members with copy of current student ID. Students who are not Student Members because of their 
income can still participate in student activities as Student-Employed. Also available are Retired and Unemployed 
memberships. If no indication is provided of multi-year membership reference, one-year membership will be 
presumed for Regular and Joint. Late payment fee does not apply to new memberships. 
SPECIAL FUNDS: INTERNATIONAL FUND: Allows ACL memberships and publications to be available to col- 
leagues having difficulty using their national currencies or for whom membership would otherwise be impossible. 
Contributions may be tax deductible; check local regulations. Receipts are available upon request. THE DON 
AND BETTY WALKER INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FUND: This fund was set up to honor Don and Betty 
Walker. It supports elect student ravel to ACL meetings. Contributions may be tax deductible, and companies 
may provide matching funds; check local regulations. Receipts are available upon request. Make checks payable 
to "THE WALKER FUND". Visa and Mastercard payments are also accepted,

PREPAYMENT is necessary; invoices and receipts are available upon request. The U.S. dollar price is definitive 
when paying in other currencies, although rounding off is appropriate. Checks and money orders should be 
made payable to the Association for Computational Linguistics (or to ACL). Payment may be made by sending 
the completed form (or all pertinent details) by email to acl@aclweb.org, fax, or mail. Payment options are: 
1. CREDIT CARDS: Payments must be made to the ACL Office in the USA. Visa and Mastercard only. Email,

or money order to the address below. Payment must be in U.S. dollars, drawn on a U.S. bank or in U.S. or 
Canadian dollars (calculated at the current exchange rate), drawn on a Canadian bank. 
3. ONLINE: ACL now has a secure server and begins online payment acceptance through the ACL Office in the 
USA of this year. Please visit www.aclweb.org to become or renew membership or place orders via the web. 
4. PAYMENTS TO EUROPE: Mail this form to Rosner with either (i) a Eurocheque or banker's draft IN SWISS 
FRANCS, payable "ACU' or (ii) a standard personal cheque drawn on a French bal~k in FRENCH FRANCS,

Guidelines for Submissions 
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers (Short or Long), Letters to 
the Editor, Squibs and Discussions): 
Papers report significant new research results in computational linguistics. Each paper is re- 
viewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing 
means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication 
to another efereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop 
proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction. 
If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication, the details of 
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version 
of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer 
Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a "work for hire," by the employer. 
This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. 
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper 
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must 
be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from 
http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission 
to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers 
in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures: 
Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive xpedited review 
by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain a description of a single experiment, 
algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit 
final versions within 8 weeks of notification. 
Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper 
might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These sub- 
missions hould normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words). 
All submissions, regardless of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and pre- 
sentation quality. 
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant o the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con- 
tributions for inclusion. 
For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters hould be sent to:

cussions of results, algorithms, or new computational linguistic data or tools of interest o the 
journal readership. Submissions should generally not exceed eight double-spaced journal pages 
and should be submitted to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and 
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was 
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing 
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring 
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural 
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics 
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language 
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed; 
others are likely to be added.
