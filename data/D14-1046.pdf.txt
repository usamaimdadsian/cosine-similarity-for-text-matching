Abstract
This paper reports on the development of a hy-
brid and simple method based on a machine
learning classifier (Naive Bayes), Word Sense
Disambiguation and rules, for the automatic
assignment of WordNet Domains to nominal
entries of a lexicographic dictionary, the Senso
Comune De Mauro Lexicon. The system ob-
tained an F1 score of 0.58, with a Precision
of 0.70. We further used the automatically as-
signed domains to filter out word sense align-
ments between MultiWordNet and Senso Co-
mune. This has led to an improvement in the
quality of the sense alignments showing the
validity of the approach for domain assign-
ment and the importance of domain informa-
tion for achieving good sense alignments.
1 Introduction and Problem Statement
Lexical knowledge, i.e. how words are used and ex-
press meaning, plays a key role in Natural Language
Processing. Lexical knowledge is available in many
different forms, ranging from unstructured terminolo-
gies (i.e. word list), to full fledged computational lexica
and ontologies (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)). The
process of creation of lexical resources is costly both
in terms of money and time. To overcome these lim-
its, semi-automatic approaches have been developed
(e.g. MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002)) with differ-
ent levels of success. Furthermore, important informa-
tion is scattered in different resources and difficult to
use. Semantic interoperability between resources could
represent a viable solution to allow reusability and de-
velop more robust and powerful resources. Word sense
alignment (WSA) qualifies as the preliminary require-
ment for achieving this goal (Matuschek and Gurevych,
2013).
WSA aims at creating lists of pairs of senses from
two, or more, (lexical-semantic) resources which de-
note the same meaning. Different approaches to WSA
have been proposed and they all share some common
elements, namely: i.) the extensive use of sense de-
scriptions of the words (e.g. WordNet glosses); and ii.)
the extension of the basic sense descriptions with addi-
tional information such as hypernyms, synonyms and
domain or category labels.
The purpose of this work is two folded: first, we exper-
iment on the automatic assignment of domain labels to
sense descriptions, and then, evaluate the impact of this
information for improving an existing sense aligned
dataset for nouns. Previous works has demonstrated
that domain labels are a good feature for obtaining high
quality alignments of entries (Navigli, 2006; Toral et
al., 2009; Navigli and Ponzetto, 2012). The Word-
Net (WN) Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000; Ben-
tivogli et al., 2004) have been selected as reference do-
main labels. We will use as candidate lexico-semantic
resources to be aligned two Italian lexica, namely, Mul-
tiWordNet (MWN) and the Senso Comune De Mauro
Lexicon (SCDM) (Vetere et al., 2011).
The two resources differ in terms of modelization: the
former, MWN, is an Italian version of WN obtained
through the “expand model” (Vossen, 1996) and per-
fectly aligned to Princeton WN 1.6, while the latter,
SCDM, is a machine readable dictionary obtained from
a paper-based reference lexicographic dictionary, De
Mauro GRADIT. Major issues for WSA of the lexica
concern the following aspects:
• SCMD has no structure of word senses (i.e. no
taxonomy, no synonymy relations, no distinction
between core senses and subsenses for polyse-
mous entries) unlike MWN;
• SCDM has no domain or category labels associ-
ated to senses (with the exception of specific ter-
minological entries) unlike MWN;
• the Italian section of MWN has only 2,481 glosses
in Italian over 28,517 synsets for nouns (i.e.
8.7%).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 will report on the methodology and exper-
iments implemented for the automatic assignment of
the WN Domains to the SCDM entries. Section 3 will
describe the dataset used for the evaluation of the WSA
experiments and the use of the WN Domains for filter-
ing the sense alignments. Finally, Section 4 illustrates
conclusion and future work.
2 Methodology and Experiments
The WN Domains consist of a set of 166 hierarchically
organized labels which have been associated to each

and express a subject field label (e.g. SPORT,
MEDICINE). A special label, FACTOTUM, has been
used for those synsets which can appear in almost all
subject fields.
The identification of a domain label to the nominal en-
tries in the SCDM Lexicon is based the “One Domain
per Discourse” (ODD) hypothesis applied to the sense
descriptions. We have used a reduced set of domains
labels (45 normalized domains) following (Magnini et
al., 2001).
To assign the WN domain label to the SCDM entries,
we have developed a hybrid method: first a binary clas-
sifier is applied to the SCDM sense descriptions to dis-
criminate between two domain values, FACTOTUM
and OTHER, where the OTHER value includes all re-
maining 44 normalized domains. After this, all entries
classified with the OTHER value are analyzed by a rule
based system and associated with a specific domain la-
bel (i.e. SPORT, MEDICINE, FOOD . . . ).
2.1 Classifier and feature selection
We have developed a training set by manually align-
ing noun senses between the two lexica. The sense
alignment allows us to associate all the information of a
synset to a corresponding entry in the SCDM lexicon,
including the WN Domain label. Concerning the test
set, we have used an existing dataset of aligned noun
pairs as in (Caselli et al., 2014). We report in Table 1
the figures for the training and test sets. Multiple align-
ments with the same domain label have been excluded
from the training set.
Characteristics Training Set Test Set
# lemmas 131 46
# of aligned pairs 369 166
# of SCDM senses 747 216
# of MWN synsets 675 229
# SCDM with
WN Domain label 350 118
Table 1: Training and test sets for the classifier.
In order for the classifier to predict the binary do-
main labels (FACTOTUM and OTHER), each sense
description of the SCDM Lexicon has been repre-
sented by means of a two-dimensional feature vector
(e.g. for training data: BINARY DOMAIN LABEL
1
The full set of labels and hierarchy is available at
http://wndomains.fbk.eu/hierarchy.html
GENERIC:val SPECIFIC:val). Feature values have
been obtained through two strategies:
• lemma label: we extract all normalized domain
labels associated to each sense of each lemma in
the sense description from MWN. The value of
the feature GENERIC corresponds to the sum of
the FACTOTUM labels. The value of the fea-
ture SPECIFIC corresponds to the sum of all other
specific domain labels (e.g. MEDICINE, SPORT
etc.) after they have been collapsed into a single
value (i.e. NOT-FACTOTUM).
• word sense label: for each sense description, we
have first performed Word Sense Disambiguation
by means of an adapted version to Italian of the
UKB package
2
(Agirre et al., 2010; Agirre et al.,
2014)
3
. Only the highest ranked synset, and as-
sociated WN Domain(s), was retained as good.
Similarly to the lemma label strategy, the sum of
the domain label FACTOTUM is assigned to the
feature GENERIC, while the sum of all other do-
main labels collapsed into the single value NOT-
FACTOTUM is assigned to the feature SPECIFIC.
We experimented with two classifiers: Naive Bayes
and Maximum Entropy as implemented in the MAL-
LET package (McCallum, 2002). We illustrate the re-
sults in Table 2. The classifiers have been evaluated
with respect to standard Precision (P), Recall (R) and
F1 against the test set. Ten-fold cross validation has
been performed on the training set as well. Classifiers
trained with the first strategy will be associated with the
label lemma, while those trained with the second strat-
egy with the label wsd.
Both classifiers obtains good results with respect to
the test data in terms of Precision and Recall. The
Naive Bayes classifier outperforms the Maximum En-
tropy one in both training approaches, suggesting better
generalization capabilities even in presence of a small
training set and basic features. The role of WSD has
a positive impact, namely for the Maximum Entropy
classifier (Precision +4 points, Recall +5 points with
respect to the lemma label). Although such a positive
effect of the WSD does not emerge for the Naive Bayes
classifier with respect to the test set, we can still ob-
serve an improvement over the ten-fold cross valida-
tion (F1= 0.69 vs. F1=0.66). We finally selected the

knowledge base and the MWN entries as dictionary

predictions of Naive Bayes

classifier as input to the
rule-based system as it provides the highest scores.
2.2 Rules for WN Domain assignment
The rule based classifier for final WN Domain assign-
ment works as follows:
• lemmatized and word sense disambiguated lem-
mas in the sense descriptions are associated with
the corresponding WN Domains from MWN;
• frequency counts on the WN Domain labels is ap-
plied; the most frequent WN Domain is assigned
as the correct WN Domain of the nominal entry;
• in case two or more WN Domains have same fre-
quency, the following assignment strategy is ap-
plied: if the frequency scores of the WN Do-
mains is equal to 1, the value FACTOTUM is se-
lected; on the contrary, if the frequency score is
higher than 1, all WN Domain labels are retained
as good.
We report the results on final domain assignment
in Table 3. The final system, NaiveBayes+Rules, has
been compared to two baselines. Both baselines ap-
ply frequency counts over the WN Domains labels
of the lemmas of the sense descriptions for the en-
tire set of the 45 normalized domain values, including
the FACTOTUM label, as explained in Section2. The
Baseline
lemma
assigns the domain by taking into ac-
count every WN Domain associated to each lemma. On
the other hand, the Baseline
wsd
selects only the WN
Domain of sense disambiguated lemmas. WSD for the
second baseline has been performed by applying the
same method described in Section 2.1. The results of
both baselines have high values for Precision (0.58 for
Baseline
lemma
, 0.70 for Baseline
wsd
). We consider
this as a further support to the validity of the ODD hy-
pothesis which seems to hold even for text descriptions
like dictionary glosses which normally use generic lex-
ical items to illustrate word senses. It is also interesting
to notice that WSD on its own has a positive impact in
Baseline
wsd
system for the assignment of specific do-
main labels (F1=0.53).
The hybrid system performs better than both base-
lines in terms of F1 scores (F1=0.58 vs. F1=0.45 for
Baseline
lemma
vs. F1=0.53 for Baseline
wsd
). How-
ever, both the hybrid system and the Baseline
wsd
ob-
tain the same Precision. To better evaluate the per-
formance of our hybrid approach, we computed the
paired t-test. The results of the hybrid system are sta-
tistically significant with respect to the Baseline
lemma
(p < 0.05) and for Recall only when compared to the
Baseline
wsd
.
To further analyze the difference between the hybrid
system and the Baseline
wsd
, we performed an error
analysis on their outputs. We have identified that the
hybrid system is more accurate in the prediction of the

ticular, the accuracy of the hybrid system on this class
is 79% while that of the baseline is only 65%. In addi-
tion to this, the hybrid system provides better results in
terms of Recall (R=0.50 vs. R=0.43). Although compa-
rable, the hybrid system provides more accurate results
with respect to the baseline.
3 Domain Filtering for WSA
This section reports on the experiments for improving
existing WSA for nouns between SDCM and MWN. In
this work we have used the same dataset and alignment
methods as in (Caselli et al., 2014), shortly described
here:
• Lexical Match: for each word w and for each
sense s in the given resources R ? {MWN,
SCDM}, we constructed a sense descriptions
d
R
(s) as a bag of words in Italian. The alignment
is based on counting the number of overlapping
tokens between the two strings, normalized by the
length of the strings;
• Cosine Similarity: we used the Personalized Page
Rank (PPR) algorithm (Agirre et al., 2010) with
WN 3.0 as knowledge base extended with the
“Princeton Annotated Gloss Corpus”. Once the
PPR vector pairs are obtained, the alignment is
obtained on the basis of the cosine score for each
pair
4
.
The dataset consists of 166 pairs of aligned senses
from MWN and SCDM for 46 nominal lemmas
(see also column “Test set” in Table 1). Overall,
SCDM covers 53.71The main difference with respect
to (Caselli et al., 2014) is that the proposed alignments
have been additionally filtered on the basis of the output
of the WN domain system (NaiveBayes
wsd
+Rules). In
particular, for each aligned pair which was considered
as good in (Caselli et al., 2014), we have applied a fur-
ther filtering based on the WN domain system results
as follows: if two senses are aligned but do not have
the same domain, they are excluded from the WSA re-
sults, otherwise they are retained. Table 4 illustrates
4
The vectors for the SCDM entries were obtained by, first,
applying Google Translate API to get the English translations
and, then, PPR over WN 3.0.

the results of the WSA approaches with domain fil-
ters. We report in brackets the results from (Caselli et
al., 2014). The filtering based on WN Domains has a
big impact on Precision and contributes to increase the
quality of the aligned senses. Although, in general, we
have a downgrading of the performance with respect to
Recall, the increase in Precision will reduce the man-
ual post-processing effort to fully aligned the two re-
sources
5
. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that,
when merging together the results of the pre-filtered
alignments from the two alignment approaches (Lex-
icalMatch+Cosine > 0.1 and LexicalMatch+Cosine >
0.2), we still have a very high Precision (> 0.70) and an
increase in Recall (> 0.40) with respect to the results of
each approach. Finally, we want to point out that what
was reported as the best alignment results in (Caselli
et al., 2014), namely LexicalMatch+Cosine > 0.2, can
be obtained, at least for Precision, with a lower filtering
cut-off threshold on the Cosine Similarity approach (i.e
cut-off threshold at or higher than 0.1)
4 Conclusions and Future Work
This work describes a hybrid approach based on a
Naive Bayes classifier, Word Sense Disambiguation
and rules for assigning WN Domains to nominal sense
descriptions of a lexicographic dictionary, the Senso
Comune De Mauro Lexicon. The assignment of do-
main labels has been used to improve WSA results on
nouns between the Senso Comune Lexicon and Mul-
tiWordNet. The results support some observations,
namely: i.) domain filtering plays an important role
in WSA, namely as a strategy to exclude wrong align-
ments (false positives) and improve the quality of the
aligned pairs; ii.) the method we have proposed is a vi-
able approach for automatically enriching existing lex-
ical resources in a reliable way; and iii.) the ODD hy-
pothesis also apply to sense descriptions.
An advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We have
used features based on frequency counts and obtained
good results, with a Precision of 0.70 for automatic WN
Domain assignment. Nevertheless, an important role
is played by Word Sense Disambiguation. The use of
domain labels obtained from sense disambiguated lem-
mas improves both the results of the classifier and those
5
The F1 of 0.64 in (Caselli et al., 2014) is obtained with a
Precision of 0.67, suggesting that some alignments are false
positives
of the rules. The absence of statistical significance with
respect to the Baseline
wsd
is not to be considered as a
negative result. As the error analysis has showed, the
classifier mostly contributes to the identification of the
FACTOTUM value, which tends to be overestimated
even with sense disambiguated lemmas, and to Recall.
We are planning to extend this work to include do-
main clusters to improve the domain assignment re-
sults, namely in terms of Recall.
