Abstract
Storyline detection from news articles
aims at summarizing events described un-
der a certain news topic and revealing how
those events evolve over time. It is a dif-
ficult task because it requires first the de-
tection of events from news articles pub-
lished in different time periods and then
the construction of storylines by linking
events into coherent news stories. More-
over, each storyline has different hierarchi-
cal structures which are dependent across
epochs. Existing approaches often ignore
the dependency of hierarchical structures
in storyline generation. In this paper, we
propose an unsupervised Bayesian model,
called dynamic storyline detection model,
to extract structured representations and
evolution patterns of storylines. The pro-
posed model is evaluated on a large scale
news corpus. Experimental results show
that our proposed model outperforms sev-
eral baseline approaches.
1 Introduction
The rapid development of online news media sites
is accompanied by the generation of tremendous
news reports. Facing such massive amount of
news articles, it is crucial to develop an automat-
ed tool which can provide a temporal summary of
events and their evolutions related to a topic from
news reports. Therefore, storyline detection, aim-
ing at summarising the development of certain re-
lated events, has been studied in order to help read-
ers quickly understand the major events reported
in news articles. It has attracted great attention re-
cently. Kawamae (2011) proposed a trend analy-
sis model which used the difference between tem-
poral words and other words in each documen-
t to detect topic evolution over time. Ahmed et
al. (2011) proposed a unified framework to group
temporally and topically related news articles in-
to same storylines in order to reveal the tempo-
ral evolution of events. Tang and Yang (2012) de-
veloped a topic-user-trend model, which incorpo-
rates user interests into the generative process of
web contents. Radinsky and Horvitz (2013) built
storylines based on text clustering and entity en-
tropy to predict future events. Huang and Huang
(2013) developed a mixture-event-aspect model to
model sub-events into local and global aspects and
utilize an optimization method to generate story-
lines. Wang et al. (2013) proposed an evolutionary
multi-branch tree clustering method for streaming
text data in which the tree construction is casted
as an online posterior estimation problem by con-
sidering both the current tree and the previous tree
simultaneously.
With the fast development of social media plat-
forms, newsworthy events are widely scattered not
only on traditional news media but also on social
media (Zhou et al., 2015). For example, Twit-
ter, one of the most widely adopted social medi-
a platforms, appears to cover nearly all newswire
events (Petrovic et al., 2013). Therefore, ap-
proaches have also been proposed for storyline
summarization on social media. Given a user in-
put query of an ongoing event, Lin et al. (2012) ex-
tracted the storyline of an event by first obtaining
relevant tweets and then generating storylines via
graph optimization. In (Li and Li, 2013), an evo-
lutionary hierarchical Dirichlet process was pro-
posed to capture the topic evolution pattern in sto-
ryline summarization.
However, most of the aforementioned ap-
proaches do not represent events in the form of
structured representation. More importantly, they
ignore the dependency of the hierarchical struc-
tures of events at different epochs in a storyline.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic storyline de-
tection model to overcome the above limitations.
1943
We assume that each document could belong to
one storyline s, which is modelled as a joint dis-
tribution over some named entities e and a set of
topics z. Furthermore, to link events at different
epochs and detect different types of storylines, the
weighted sum of storyline distribution of previous
epochs is employed as the prior of the current s-
toryline distribution. The proposed model is eval-
uated on a large scale news corpus. Experimental
results show that our proposed model outperforms
several baseline approaches.
2 Methodology
To model the generation of a storyline in con-
secutive time periods for a stream of documents,
we propose an unsupervised latent variable mod-
el, called dynamic storyline detection model (DS-
DM), The graphical model of DSDM is shown in
Figure 1.

Figure 1: The Dynamic Storyline Detection mod-
el.
In this model, we assume that the storyline-
topic-word, storyline-topic and storyline-entity
probabilities at time t are dependent on the
previous storyline-topic-word, storyline-topic and
storyline-entity distributions in the lastM epochs.
For a certain period of time, we assume that each
document could belong to one storyline s, which is
modelled as a joint distribution over some named
entities e and a set of topics z. This assumption es-
sentially encourages documents published around
similar time that involve the same named entities
and discuss similar topics to be grouped into the
same storyline. As the storyline distribution is
shared across documents with the same named en-
tities and similar topics, it essentially preserves the
ambiguity that for example, documents compris-
ing the same person and location may or may not
belong to the same storyline.
The generative process of DSDM is shown be-
low:
For each time period t from 1 to T :
• Draw a distribution over storylines pit
s
?
Dirichlet(?
t
s
).
• For each storyline s ? {1...S}:
– Draw a distribution over topics
?t
s
? Dirichlet(?
t
s
).
– Draw a distribution over named entities ?t
s
?
Dirichlet(?
t
s
).
– For each topic k ? {1...K}, draw a word distri-
bution ?t
s,k
? Dirichlet(?
t
s
).
• For each document d ? {1...D}:
– Choose a storyline indicator st
d
?
Multinomial(?
t
s
).
– For each named entity e ? {1...E
d
}:
? Choose a named entity e ?
Multinomial(?
t
s
).
– For other word positions n ? {1...N
d
}:
? Choose a topic z
n
? Multinomial(?
t
s
).
? Choose a word w
n
? Multinomial(?
t
s,z
).
We define an evolutionary matrix of storyline
indicator s and topic z, ?
t
s,z,m
, where each colum-
n ?
t
s,z,m
denotes storyline-topic-word distribution
of storyline indicator s and topic z at epoch m,
an evolutionary topic matrix of storyline indicator
s, ?
t
s
, where each column ?
t
s,m
denotes storyline-
topic distribution of storyline indicator at epoch
m, an evolutionary entity matrix of storyline in-
dicator s, ?
t
s
, where each column ?
t
s,m
denotes
storyline-entity distribution of storyline indicator
s.
We attach a vector of M + 1 weights µ
t
s,z
=
{µ
t
s,z,m
}

m=0
(µ

with its components representing the weights that
each ?
t
s,z,m
contributes to calculating the priors of
?
t
s,z
. We do it similarly for ?
t
s
and ?
t
s
. The Dirich-
let prior for the storyline-topic-word distribution,
the storyline-topic distribution and the storyline-
entity distribution, respectively, at epoch t are:
?
t

In our experiments, the weight parameters are
set to be the same regardless of storylines or top-
ics. They are only dependent on the time win-
dow using an exponential decay function, µ
m

exp(?0.5×m) wherem stands for themth epoch
counting backwards in the past M epochs. That
is, more recent documents would have a relatively
stronger influence on the model parameters in the
current epoch compared to earlier documents. It is
also possible to estimate the weights directly from
data. We leave it as our future work.
The storyline-topic-word distribution ?
t
s,z
, the
storyline-topic distribution ?
t

and the storyline-
entity distribution ?
t

at the current epoch t are
generated from the Dirichlet distribution param-
eterized by ?

s,k
?
Dir(?

), ?
t
s
? Dir(?

). With this formulation,
we can ensure that the mean of the Dirichlet pa-
rameter for the current epoch becomes proportion-
al to the weighted sum of the word, topic distribu-
tion, and entity distribution at previous epochs.
3 Inference and Parameter Estimation
We use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and
Steyvers, 2004) to infer the parameters of the mod-
el, given observed data D. Gibbs sampling is a
Markov chain Monte Carlo method which allows
us repeatedly sample from a Markov chain whose
stationary distribution is the posterior of interest,
s
t
d
and z
t
d,n
here, from the distribution over that
variable given the current values of all other vari-
ables and the data. Such samples can be used to
empirically estimate the target distribution. Let-
ting the subscript ?d denote the quantity that ex-
cludes counts in document d, the conditional pos-
terior for s

Letting the index x = (d, n) denote nth word in
document d and the subscript?x denote a quantity
that excludes data from the nth word position in
document d. We only sample a topic z

if the nth

conditional posterior:

Once the latent variables s and z are known,
we can easily estimate the model parameters

? = 0.1, ? = ? = 0.01 for the current epoch
(i.e., m = 0), and gather statistics in the previous

run Gibbs sampler for 1000 iterations and stop the
iteration once the log-likelihood of the training da-
ta converges under the learned model.
4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset
We crawled and parsed the GDELT Even-
t Database
1
containing news articles published in
May 2014. We manually annotated one-week da-
ta containing 101,654 documents and identified 77
storylines for evaluation. We also report the result-
s of our model on the one-month data containing
526,587 documents. But we only report the preci-
sion and not recall of the storylines extracted since
it is time consuming to identify all the true story-
lines in such a large dataset. In our experiments,
we used the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer
for identifying the named entities. In addition, we
removed common stopwords and only kept tokens
1

index.html
1945
which are verbs, nouns, or adjectives in these news
articles.
4.2 Baselines
We chose the following three methods as the base-
line approaches.
1. K-Means + Cosine Similarity (KMCS): the
method first applies K-Means to cluster news
documents for each day, then link storylines
detected in different days based on the cosine
similarity measurement.
2. LDA + Cosine Similarity (LDCS): the
method first splits news documents on a daily
basis, then applies the Latent Dirichlet Allo-
cation (LDA) model to detect the latent story-
lines for the documents in each day, in which
each storyline is modelled as a joint distribu-
tion over named entities and words, and final-
ly links storylines detected in different days
using the cosine similarity measurement.
3. Dynamic LDA (DLDA)
2
: this is the dynam-
ic LDA (Blei and Lafferty, 2006) where the
topic-word distributions are linked across e-
pochs based on the Markovian assumption.
That is, the topic-word distribution at the cur-
rent epoch is only influenced by the topic-
word distribution in the previous epoch.
4.3 Evaluation Metric
To evaluate the performance of the proposed ap-
proach, we use precision, recall and F-score which
are commonly used in evaluating information ex-
traction systems. The precision is calculated based
on the following criteria: 1) The entities and key-
words extracted refer to the same storyline. 2) The
duration of the storyline is correct. We assume that
the start date (or end date) of a storyline is the pub-
lication date of the first (or last) news article about
it.
4.4 Experimental Results
The proposed model is compared against the base-
line approaches on the annotated one-week da-
ta which consist of 77 storylines. The number
of storylines, S, and the number of topics, K,
are both set to 100. The number of historical e-
pochs, M , which is taken into account for set-
ting the Dirichlet priors for the storyline-topic-
word, the storyline-topic and the storyline-entity

Topic number is set to 100 for both DLDA and LDCS.
Cluster number is also set to 100 for KMCS.
distributions, is set to 7. The evaluation results of
our proposed approach in comparison to the three
baselines are presented in Table 1.
Method Precision Recall F-score
KMCS 22.73 32.47 26.74
LDCS 34.29 31.17 32.66
DLDA 62.67 61.03 61.84
DSDM 70.67 68.80 69.27
Table 1: Performance comparison of the storyline
extraction results in terms of Precision (%), Recall
(%) and F-score (%).
It can be observed from Table 1 that simply
using K-means to cluster news articles in each
day and linking similar stories across differen-
t days in hoping of identifying storylines gives
the worst results. Using LDA to detect stories
in each day improves the precision dramatically.
The dynamic LDA model assumes topics (or sto-
ries) in the current epoch evolves from the previ-
ous epoch and further improves the storyline de-
tection results significantly. Our proposed mod-
el aims to capture the long distance dependen-
cies in which the statistics gathered in the past 7
days are taken into account to set the Dirichlet pri-
ors of the storyline-topic-word, storyline-topic and
storyline-entity distributions in the current epoch.
It gives the best performance and outperforms dy-
namic LDA by nearly 7% in F-measure.
To study the impact of the number of topics on
the performance of the proposed model, we con-
ducted experiments on the one-month data with d-
ifferent number of topics varying between 100 and
200. In all these experiments, the number of story-
lines, S, is set to 200, based on the speculation that
about 40 storylines in the annotated one-week data
last for one month and about 40 new storylines oc-
cur each week. Table 2 shows the precision of the
proposed method under different number of topic-
s. It can be observed that the performance of the
proposed approach is quite stable across different
number of topics.

Figure 2: Storyline about the patent infringement case between Apple and Samsung was extracted by the
proposed Model.
4.5 Structured Browsing
We illustrate the evolution of storylines by using
structured browsing, from which the structured in-
formation (entity, topic, keywords) about story-
lines and the duration of storylines can be easily
observed. Figure 2 shows the storyline about “The
patent infringement case between Apple and
Samsung”. It can be observed that in the first two
days, the hierarchical structure consists of entities
(Apple, Samsung) and keywords (trial, patent, in-
fringe). The case has gained significant attention
in the next three days when US jury orders Sam-
sung to pay Apple $119.6 million. It can be ob-
served that the stories in the next three days also
consist of entities (Apple, Samsung), but with d-
ifferent keywords (award, patent, win). The last
day’s story gives an overall summary and consists
of entities (Apple, Samsung) and keywords (jury,
patent, company).
To further investigate the storylines detected by
the proposed model, we randomly selected three
detected storylines. The first one is about “the
patent infringement case between Apple and
Samsung”. It is a short-term storyline lasting for
6 day as shown in Figure 3. The second one is
about “India election”, which is a long-term sto-
ryline lasting for one month. The third one is about
“Pistorius shoot Steenkamp”, which is an inter-
mittent storyline, lasting for a total of 22 days but
with no relevant news reports in certain days as
shown in Figure 3. It can be observed that the pro-
posed model can detect not only continuous but
also intermittent storylines, which further demon-
strates the advantage of the proposed model.

5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we have proposed an unsupervised
Bayesian model to extract storylines from news
corpus. Experimental results show that our pro-
posed model is able to extract both continuous and
intermittent storylines and outperforms a number
of baselines. In future work, we will consider
modelling background topics explicitly and inves-
tigating more principled ways in setting the weight
parameters of the statistics gathered in the histor-
ical epochs. Moreover, we will also explore the
impact of different scale of the dependencies from
historical epochs on the distributions of the current
epoch.
