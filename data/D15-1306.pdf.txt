Abstract
We propose a novel data augmentation ap-
proach to enhance computational behav-
ioral analysis using social media text. In
particular, we collect a Twitter corpus of
the descriptions of annoying behaviors us-
ing the #petpeeve hashtags. In the qual-
itative analysis, we study the language
use in these tweets, with a special focus
on the fine-grained categories and the ge-
ographic variation of the language. In
quantitative analysis, we show that lexi-
cal and syntactic features are useful for au-
tomatic categorization of annoying behav-
iors, and frame-semantic features further
boost the performance; that leveraging
large lexical embeddings to create addi-
tional training instances significantly im-
proves the lexical model; and incorporat-
ing frame-semantic embedding achieves
the best overall performance.
1 Introduction
In the ever-expanding era of social media, many
scientific disciplines, such as health and health-
care, biology, and learning sciences, have adopted
computational approaches to exploit patterns and
behaviors in large datasets (Wang et al., 2015;
Chen and Lonardi, 2009; Baker and Yacef, 2009).
In contrast, the primary methods for behavioral
sciences still rely on lab experiments with limited
amount of subjects, which are time consuming and
financially expensive. In addition to this, it is also
difficult to obtain a set of samples with geograph-
?
We understand that many people find long titles annoy-
ing, so we intentionally use a very long one to help people
understand what “pet peeve” means.

ical variations in traditional lab-based behavioral
experiments.
While the social media data are abundantly
available, computational approaches to behavioral
sciences using Twitter are not well-studied. Even
when statistical techniques are applied to these
tasks, their concentration has been on simple sta-
tistical significance tests and descriptive statis-
tics (De Charms, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). There-
fore, we believe that statistical natural language
processing techniques are needed for insightful
analysis and interpretation in behavioral studies.
In this paper, we use Twitter as a corpus for
computational behavioral science. More specifi-
cally, we focus on a case study of analyzing an-
noying behaviors. To do this, we exploit a corpus
of 9 million tweets (Cheng et al., 2010), and ex-
tract the tweets that describe these behaviors us-
ing the #petpeeve hashtags. #petpeeve is a pop-
ular Twitter hashtag, which describes behaviors
that might be annoying to others. An example
of #petpeeve tweets is shown in Figure 1. To fa-
cilitate the analysis, we manually annotate 3,375
tweets with 60 fine-grained categories, which will
be described in Section 3. We use a sparse mixed-
effects topic model to analyze the salient words
in each category, as well as the geographic varia-
tions. We show that lexical, syntactic, and seman-
tic features enhance the automatic categorization
of annoying behaviors; and that the performance
is further improved with a novel lexical and frame-
semantic embedding based data augmentation ap-
2557
proach. Our main contributions are three-fold:
• We provide a Twitter corpus with fine-
grained annotations for computational behav-
ior studies;
• We qualitatively analyze the Twitter language
concerning annoying behaviors, with a focus
on the topics and geographical variations;
• We propose various linguistic features and a
novel data augmentation approach for auto-
matic categorization of annoying behaviors.
We outline related work in the next section. The
dataset is described in Section 3. We introduce the
approach for analyzing #petpeeve Tweets in Sec-
tion 4. Experimental results are shown in Sec-
tion 5. We discuss possible applications in Sec-
tion 6, and conclude in Section 7.
2 Related Work
Psychologists, behavioral scientists, and computer
scientists have studied a wide-range of methods
for behavior extraction (Mast et al., 2015). For ex-
ample, in lab experiments, arm and body postures
(Marcos-Ramiro et al., 2013) are often used to ex-
tract self-touch and gestures, while eye gaze (Fu-
nes Mora and Odobez, 2012), head pose (Ba and
Odobez, 2011), face location and motion (Nguyen
et al., 2012), and full-body pose (Shotton et al.,
2013) can also be used as cues to extract gaz-
ing, nodding, and arm-related behaviors. There
are also significant amount of studies of extract-
ing facial and speech features to understand smil-
ing (Bartlett et al., 2008), eye contact (Marin-
Jimenez et al., 2014), and verbal behaviors (Basu,
2002).
With the surge of interest in computational
social science (Lazer et al., 2009), Twitter has
become a popular resource to study data-driven
methods in social science (Miller, 2011). For ex-
ample, O’Connor et al. (2010a) align the Twit-
ter messages with public opinion time series to
study computational political science. Ritter et
al. (2010) study Twitter dialogues using a clus-
tering approach. Bollen et al. (2011) use a sen-
timent analysis approach to predict the Ameri-
can stock market via Twitter. Li et al. (2014b)
have investigated the alignment of Twitter mood
with weather for sentiment analysis. In recent
years, language technology researchers have fo-
cused on developing genre-specific Twitter part-
of-speech tagging (Gimpel et al., 2011), named

al., 2014), machine translation (Ling et al., 2013),
and dependency parsing (Kong et al., 2014) meth-
ods. To the best of our knowledge, even though
there have been studies on using Twitter hashtags
to study language-related behaviors (Gonz´alez-
Ib´anez et al., 2011; Bamman and Smith, 2015),
Twitter NLP approaches to non-linguistic behav-
iors are not well studied in general.
3 The Dataset
We use the Twitter corpus with 9 million sam-
pled messages collected in prior work (Cheng et
al., 2010), which includes a total of 121K users.
The dataset includes latitude and longitude infor-
mation.
We extract 3,375 tweets
1
with #petpeeve hash-
tags. We follow past work to annotate the
tweets (Ritter et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014a): we
apply the LDA clustering + human-identification
approach to label the categories of the described
annoying behaviors in these tweets. The human
annotation process includes two stages: first, the
annotators identify the 50 categories from the clus-
tering process, and use these topics as a candi-
1
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/˜yww/data/petpeeves.zip
2558
date label set to annotate the data; in the second
stage, the categories are refined (to 60 classes)
from the first pass, and the data is re-annotated
with the refined human-specified category labels.
Due to the complexity of this fine-grained anno-
tation task, the inter-annotator agreement rate be-
tween two annotators is moderate (0.445).
The annotated categories and label distribution
2
of the dataset are shown in Table 1. In our random
samples, the states that post the most #petpeeve
tweets are NY, MD, CA, NJ, FL, GA, VA, TX,
NC, PA, and DC. In our predictive experiments,
we randomly select 60% of tweets for training, and
40% for testing.
4 Our Approach
In this section, we describe our methods for the
qualitative and quantitative analyses. In particular,
we briefly review a supervised approach of using
sparse mixed-effects topic model to visualize the
topical words to analyze this behavior data. For
the quantitative task of automatic categorization of
tweets, we propose a novel approach to create ad-
ditional training data, using continuous lexical and
semantic representations.
4.1 Supervised Topic Modeling
To analyze the salient words for each category of
annoying behaviors, we utilize SAGE (Eisenstein
et al., 2011), a state-of-the-art mixed-effect topic
model, which has been used in several NLP ap-
plications (Sim et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).
SAGE is ideal for our text analytic purposes, be-
cause it is supervised, and it builds relatively clean
topic models by considering the additive effects
and the background distribution of words. There-
fore, we can use SAGE to visualize the salient
words for each category of annoying behaviors
using the 3,375 #petpeeve tweets. Each tweet
is treated as a document, and we use Markov
Chain Monte Carlo for inference. To facilitate
the geographical analysis, we use Google’s reverse
geocoding service to extract the state information
from coordinates, and apply SAGE for visualiza-
tion.
2
The categories that are not shown in the table are back-
stabbing, boring, copycat, drinking, drug, empty promise,
impoliteness, inconsiderate, indirect, insecurity, interference,
irresponsible, jealous, judge, loneliness, misunderstanding,
negativity, noisy, parents, politics, repetition, showoff, snob-
bish, stability, swearing, time-wasting, ungratefulness, and
others.
4.2 Embedding-Based Data Augmentation
for Automatic Categorization of Tweets
In addition to the visualization task, we also ask
the question: can we use linguistic cues to predict
tweets that describe different annoying behaviors?
We formulate the problem as a multiclass classi-
fication task, and consider the following feature
sets:
• Lexical Features: we extract unigrams as
surface-level lexical features.
• Part-of-Speech Features: to model shallow
syntactic cues, we extract lexicalized part-of-
speech features using the Stanford part-of-
speech tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003).
• Dependency Triples: to better understand
the deeper syntactic dependencies of key-
words in tweets, we have also extracted typed
dependency triples (e.g., nsubj(hate,I)) using
the MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007).
• Frame-Semantics Features: SE-
MAFOR (Das et al., 2010) is a state-of-
the-art frame-semantics parser that produces
FrameNet-style semantic annotation. We use
SEMAFOR to extract frame-level semantic
features.
Embeddings for Data Augmentation Since the
Twitter messages are often short and noisy, and
the training data is relatively scarce for each class,
we consider the feasibility of leveraging external
resources, in particular, continuous word embed-
dings (Mikolov et al., 2013a) to enhance the mul-
ticlass text categorization model.
Two major challenges for leveraging word em-
beddings for tweet classification are: 1) because
word embeddings are continuous, it is difficult to
fuse them with other discrete syntactic and se-
mantic features; 2) it is not straightforward how
one should transform the word-level representa-
tion to the tweet-level representation. In our pre-
liminary experiments, we have evaluated the con-
tinuous word representation method (Turian et al.,
2010), as well as incorporating neighboring words
in the embeddings as additional features, but both
methods fail to outperform the lexical baseline that
uses only bag-of-word unigrams.
To solve this problem, we propose the use of
neighboring words in continuous representations
to create new instances to augment the training

(knn) word w for a query term using cosine sim-
ilarity between query

W :

cosine(

For each word in a tweet, we query the exter-
nal embeddings, and replace them with their knn
words to create a new training instance. For ex-
ample, consider the tweet “Being late is terrible”
with the punctuality label, after searching for knn
words for each token, we create a new training in-
stance: “Be behind are bad” with the same label.
Frame-Semantic Embeddings Although lexi-
cal (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and dependency based
embeddings (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) have been
studied, semantic-based embedding is still less un-
derstood. We consider the continuous embedding
of semantic frames (Baker et al., 1998). To do this,
we semantically parsed 3.8 million tweets using
SEMAFOR (Das et al., 2010), and built a continu-
ous bag-of-frame model to represent each seman-
tic frame using Word2Vec
3
. We then use the same
data augmentation approach to create additional
instances with these semantic frame embeddings.

5 Experiments
5.1 Qualitative Analysis
We show the results of the visualization of salient
words for each category of tweets in Table 2.
SAGE clearly does a good job identifying annoy-
ing specific behaviors in each category. For ex-
ample, in the traffic category, we see that the key-
words “cop” and “pulled” that associate with traf-
fic stop are identified. Also, “slow” and “speed”
are also recognized as annoying behaviors dur-
ing traffic. In the selfishness category, the word
“ONLY” and “Selfish” are corrected identified. In
the silence category, we see that the word “R” is
promising, because it indicates the behavior when
someone reads a blackberry message without re-
ply. We see that many slang expressions are asso-
ciated with various labels.
In Table 3, we show the geographical varia-
tion of tweets. The word “dmv” (DC-Maryland-
Virginia) is correctly associated with MD and DC,
and when we search the database, these #petpeeve
tweets mainly refer to the 2010 snowstorm in the
Winter affecting these areas. The “daddy” is
prominent in the state of Florida, while the word
“rims” is also identified, showing the unique car
culture of this southern state.

as the classifier in our 60-way multi-class classifi-
cation experiments. Grid search is used to select
the best hyper-parameter using the training data
only. A final classifier is then trained using the
best hyper-parameters and test set results are re-
ported. We set k = 5 for knn in our data augmen-
tation experiments: the training data is expanded
to 5 times of the original size. We use a paired
two-tailed student’s t test to assess the statistical
significance.
Word2Vec is used to train various lexical and
semantic embedding models. We consider three
lexical embeddings and one frame-semantic em-
beddings for data augmentation: 1) Google-
News Lexical Embeddings trained with 100 bil-
lion words (Mikolov et al., 2013b); 2) Twitter Lex-
ical Embeddings trained with 51 million of words;
3) Urban Dictionary lexical embeddings trained
with 53 million of words from slang definitions
and examples; 4) Twitter Semantic Frame Embed-
dings trained with 27 million frames.
Varying Feature Sets We compare various fea-
tures in Table 4. We see that adding shallow part-
of-speech features does not have a strong effect
on the performance, but adding the dependency
triples significantly outperforms the lexical base-
line. We see that the semantic frames are partic-
ular useful, showing a 7% relative improvement
over the baseline.
The Effectiveness of Data Augmentation Table 5
shows the results of data augmentation. We see
that using the Google News lexical embeddings to
augment the training data brings a 6.1% relative
F1 improvement over the lexical baseline. When
considering the additional frame-semantic embed-
dings from Twitter, our system obtains the best F1
of 0.380, bringing a 3.8% improvement over the
no data augmentation baseline with all linguistic
features.
6 Discussion
We provide a case study of automatically cat-
egorizing annoying behaviors using #petpeeve
Tweets. We hope that this study can further solicit
relevant research on fine-grained analysis of an-
noying behaviors in different dimensions, and use
computational approaches to improve social good.
For example, by using coordinates and other APIs,
one might analyze the annoying behaviors in the
public working environments (e.g., office, meeting
rooms, etc.). By understanding what annoys their
employees, companies can renovate their working
setups, refine their policies, and improve the satis-
faction and productivity of their employees.
In addition to #petpeeve Tweets, there are many
other interesting hashtags that align well with tra-
ditional topics in behavior sciences. For exam-
ple, hashtags like #occupywallstreet can be used
to study crowd behaviors in terms of a political un-
rest. The #ALS hashtag can be used to study public
behaviors in reaction to philanthropic campaigns.
Overall, Tweets from carefully selected hashtags
can be inexpensive to obtain, and facilitate signif-
icant amount of behavioral studies.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a case study of the
annoying behaviors using Twitter as a corpus. Our
fine-grained visualization approach shows insights
of different categories of these behaviors, with the
geographical effects. We also show that linguis-
tic cues are useful to categorize these behaviors
automatically, and that using lexical and semantic
embeddings as a data augmentation method sig-
nificantly improves the performance.
