Abstract
When translating from languages with
hardly any inflectional morphology like
English into morphologically rich lan-
guages, the English word forms often
do not contain enough information for
producing the correct fullform in the
target language. We investigate meth-
ods for improving the quality of such
translations by making use of part-of-
speech information and maximum en-
tropy modeling. Results for translations
from English into Spanish and Catalan
are presented on the LC-STAR corpus
which consists of spontaneously spoken
dialogues in the domain of appointment
scheduling and travel planning.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we address the question of how part-
of-speech (POS) information can help improv-
ing the quality of Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT). One of the main problems when translat-
ing from a language with hardly any inflectional
morphology (which is English in our experiments)
into one with richer morphology (here: Spanish
and Catalan) is the production of the correct in-
flected form in the target language. We introduce
transformations to the English string that are based
on the part-of-speech information and show how
this knowledge source can help SMT. Systematic
evaluations will show that the quality of the gen-
erated translations is improved.
The transformations we apply are the following:
Treatment of verbs In Catalan and Spanish, the
pronoun before a verb is often omitted and in-
stead, the person is expressed via the ending
of the verb. The same holds for future tense
and for the modes expressed through 'would'
and 'should' in English. Since this makes it
hard to generate the correct translation of a
given English verb, we propose a method re-
sulting in English word forms containing suf-
ficient information.
Question inversion In English, interrogative
phrases have a word order that is different
from declarative sentences: Either an auxil-
iary 'do' is inserted or the order of verb and
pronoun is inverted. Since this is different
in Spanish and Catalan, we modify the word
order in English to make it more similar to
the Spanish/Catalan one and to help the verb
treatment mentioned above.
The paper is organized as follows: Related work
is treated in Section 2. In Section 3, we shortly
review the statistical approach to machine transla-
tion. Then, we introduce the transformations that
we apply to the less inflected language of the two
under consideration (namely English) in Section 4.
After describing the maximum entropy approach
and the training procedure we use for the statisti-
cal lexicon in Section 5, we present results on the
trilingual LC-STAR corpus in Section 6. Then, we
conclude and present ideas about future work in
Section 7.

2 Related Work
Publications dealing with the integration of lin-
guistic information into the process of statisti-
cal machine translation are rather few although
this had already been suggested in (Brown et al.,
1992). (NieBen and Ney, 2001b) introduce hier-
archical lexicon models including baseform and
POS information for translation from German into
English. Information contained in the German en-
tries that are not relevant for the generation of
the English translation are omitted. Unlike this,
we investigate methods for enriching English with
knowledge to help selecting the correct fullform in
a morphologically richer language.
(Niefien and Ney, 2001a) propose reordering oper-
ations for the language pair German—English that
help SMT by harmonizing word order between
source and target. The question inversion we apply
was inspired by this; nevertheless, we do not per-
form a full morpho-syntactic analysis, but make
use only of POS information which can be ob-
tained from freely available tools.
(Garcia-Varea et al., 2001) apply a maximum en-
tropy approach for training the statistical lexicon,
but do not take any linguistic information into ac-
count.
The use of POS information for improving statisti-
cal alignment quality is described in (Toutanova et
al., 2002), but no translation results are presented.
3 Statistical Machine Translation
The goal of machine translation is the translation
of an input string Si,. . . , s j in the source language
into a target language string ti tI. We choose
the string that has maximal probability given the
source string, Pr(tils1). Applying Bayes' deci-
sion rule yields the following criterion:
arg max Pr(t i s i )
tf
= arg max{Pr(t1) • Pr(s1
tf
4)1	 (1)
Through this decomposition of the probability, we
obtain two knowledge sources: the translation and
the language model. Those two can be modelled
independently of each other.
The correspondence between the words in the
source and the target string is described by align-
ments that assign target word positions to each
source word position. The probability of a certain
target language word to occur in the target string
is assumed to depend basically only on the source
words aligned to it.
The search is denoted by the arg max operation
in Eq. 1, i.e. it explores the space of all possible
target language strings and all possible alignments
between the source and the target language string
to find the one with maximal probability.
The input string can be preprocessed before being
passed to the search algorithm. If necessary, the
inverse of these transformations will be applied
to the generated output string. In the work pre-
sented here, we restrict ourselves to transforming
only one language of the two: the source, which
has the less inflected morphology.
For descriptions of SMT systems see for exam-
ple (Germann et al., 2001; Och et al., 1999; Till-
mann and Ney, 2002; Vogel et al., 2000; Wang and
Waibel, 1997).
4 Transformations in the Less Inflected
Language
When translating from English into languages
with a highly inflected morphology, the production
of the correct fullform often causes problems. Our
experience on several corpora shows that the error
rate of a translation from English into morpholog-
ically richer languages decreases by 10% relative
if we aim at producing only the correct baseform
instead of the fully inflected word. The transfer
of the meaning expressed in the baseform is easier
than deciding on the correct inflected form.
4.1 Treatment of Verbs
Especially the translation of verbs is difficult since
there are many different inflections in Spanish
and Catalan whereas there are only few in En-
glish. Moreover, the pronouns and modals are of-
ten omitted in Spanish and Catalan and this infor-
mation is expressed through the suffix. This makes
it very hard for word-based systems to generate
the correct inflection from the English verb which
does not contain sufficient information. Thus, sev-
eral English words will have to be aligned to the
Spanish or Catalan verbs. This process is rela-
348
tively difficult for the algorithm and causes noise
in the statistical lexicon if English pronouns are re-
garded as translations of Spanish or Catalan verbs.
In order to enrich the English verb with the needed
information, we combine pronouns and/or modals
with following verbs and treat those combinations
as 'new' fullform words in English. Thus we can
obtain the information needed to select the correct
verb form in the target language from one single
English word. The identification of English pro-
nouns, modals and verbs was done by POS tag-
ging applied to the English part of the corpus.
We decided to transform the source language in-
stead of the target language, because in this case
we need only the POS tags of the source language
as additional knowledge source and nothing else.
Another possible approach would have been to
split the suffix in the target language (e.g. 'esta'
into 'estar P3S'). This would require postprocess-
ing tools that are able to generate the correct verb
form from the baseform and the person and tense
information.
Table 1 gives examples of words that have been
spliced to form new entries of the English lexi-
con. For example, we splice the phrase 'you think'
to form the single entry 'you_think' which con-
tains sufficient information for producing the cor-
rect Spanish verb form 'crees' or the Catalan
'creus' . Similarly, the modal auxiliaries can be
added as well, like in the entry 'you_will_have'
which is much better suited for being translated
into 'tendras' (Spanish) or 'tindras' (Catalan) than
the verb 'have' alone. Moreover, in a single word
based lexicon, three single entries would have to
be added for the translation of 'you will have'
into 'tendras': (you,tendras), (will,tendras) and
(have,tendras), which spreads the translation prob-
ability over far too many entries and makes the
probability distribution unfocused.
As the last example in Table 1 shows, 'you can
go' is spliced only into two words instead of one
in order to better match the Spanish/Catalan form.
4.2 Question Treatment
In English interrogative phrases, either an auxil-
iary 'do' is inserted or the order of verb and pro-
noun is inverted. The auxiliary 'do' does not carry
information that is relevant when translating into
Table 1: Examples of spliced words in the English
vocabulary
original POS tags spliced words
you go PRP VBP you_go
you went PRP VBD you_went
you think PRP VBP you_think
you will have PRP MD VB you_will_have
you can go PRP MD VB you_can go
Spanish or Catalan. Thus, we can remove it from
the sentence without harming the translation pro-
cess (as described in (NieBen and Ney, 2001a) for
the language pair German—English). However, we
do not remove a question supporting 'do' in past
tense, i. e. 'did' is kept in the phrase, because this
is the only word containing the tense information.
Afterwards, we can merge the pronoun and verb
as depicted in Table 2: 'did you go' is transformed
into 'you_did go'. We do not splice 'you_did' and
'go', because the English simple past is translated
into present perfect in Catalan; and it is very likely
to be translated into present perfect in Spanish, es-
pecially in colloquial language as it is present in
this task. The form 'you_did go' is well suited to
be translated into the Spanish 'has ido' or the Cata-
lan 'has anat'.
If there is no question supporting 'do' and the or-
der of pronoun and verb is inverted — see the exam-
ple 'how are you?' in Table 3 — we first swap the
two words and then perform the splicing step. This
is done in order to avoid having two lexical entries
with the same translation: for example, ' you_are'
and the interrogative 'are_you' both have the same
translation in Spanish or Catalan, respectively.
Table 3 presents examples of transformed English
questions. Comparing them to the Spanish and
Catalan reference, we see that it is easier to find
a word-to-word mapping for the modified English
sentences.
5 Maximum Entropy Training
If we merge the pronouns/modals and verbs as de-
scribed above, it might happen that the verb itself
(or one of its inflections) has never been seen in
training except from its appearance in the new en-
tries in the lexicon which result from the splic-
349

ing operation. This makes it impossible to trans-
late the verb itself, because it is then unknown
to the system. The same holds for combinations
of pronouns and verbs that are unseen in train-
ing, e. g. the training corpus contains the bigram
'I went', but not the one 'she went'. In order
to overcome this problem, we train our lexicon
model using maximum entropy.
5.1 The Maximum Entropy Approach
The maximum entropy approach (Berger et al.,
1996) presents a powerful framework for the com-
bination of several knowledge sources. This prin-
ciple recommends to choose the distribution which
preserves as much uncertainty as possible in terms
of maximizing the entropy. The distribution is re-
quired to satisfy constraints, which represent facts
known from the data. These constraints are ex-
pressed on the basis of feature functions hu,(s,t),
where (s, t) is a pair of source and target word.
The lexicon probability of a source word given the
target word has the following functional form
1 
t) 	Z(t) exP Y.‘L_, Amh„,(s,t)
with the normalization factor
Z(t) = E exp [E X„,h,„,(s' ,t)]
where A = {Am } is the set of model parameters
with one weight A, for each feature function hm .
The features we use in our model are
• a lexical feature (for the entries of the trans-
formed vocabulary):
12 8, (s, t) = (5(s, s') • 6(t, t')
P (s
350
• the verb contained in a transformed lexicon
entry (e.g. 'go' for 'you_go' or 'you_will_go):
hs , , v (s ,t) = S(s. s') • V erb(t, v)
where
1, if t contains the verb vV erb(t, v) = 0, otherwise
This enables us to translate the verb alone even if
it occurs in the training corpus only as a spliced
entry.
For an introduction to maximum entropy modeling
and training procedures, the reader is referred to
the corresponding literature, for instance (Berger
et al., 1996) or (Ratnaparkhi, 1997).
5.2 Training
We performed the following training steps:
• transform the English (= source language)
part of the corpus as described in Sections 4.1
and 4.2
• train the statistical translation system using
this modified source language corpus 1
• with the resulting alignment, train the lexicon
model using maximum entropy with the fea-
tures described in Section 5.1
This training can be performed using converg-
ing iterative training procedures like described by
(Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) or (Della Pietra et
al., 1997) 2 . The basic training procedures for the
translation system and the language model need
not be changed.
5.3 Translation process
For translation, we can use an SMT system where
the search algorithm does not have to be modified.
Before the translation process, we transform the
input in the same way as the training corpus be-
fore training the alignment (see Section 5.2). We
simply have to exclude those words from splicing
where the splicing operation yields an unknown
word.
'This training was done using the GIZA++ toolkit which
can be downloaded from http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-
aachen.deroch/software/GIZA++.html

6 Results
6.1 Corpora
We performed experiments on the trilingual
corpus which is successively built within the
LC-STAR project. It comprises the languages
English, Spanish and Catalan, whereof we used
English as source and Spanish and Catalan as tar-
get languages. At the time of our experiments, we
had about 13k sentences per language available;
the statistics are given in Table 4.
The corpus consists of transcriptions of sponta-
neously spoken dialogues. Thus, the sentences
often lack correct syntactic structure. The domain
of this task is appointment scheduling and travel
arrangements.
The POS information for the English part of the
corpus was generated using the Brill tagger3 .
As Table 4 shows, the splicing operation increases
the cardinality of the English vocabulary as
well as the number of singletons significantly.
Nevertheless, they are still below those numbers
for Spanish and Catalan.
6.2 Evaluation Metrics
The quality of the output of our machine transla-
tion system is measured automatically by compar-
ing the generated translation to a given reference
translation. The two following criteria are used:
• WER (word error rate):
The word error rate is based on the Leven-
shtein distance. It is computed as the min-
imum number of substitution, insertion and
deletion operations that have to be performed
to convert the generated string into the ref-
erence string. Since some sentences in the
develop and test set occur several times with
different reference translations (which holds
especially for short sentences like 'okay,
good-bye'), we calculate the minimal dis-
tance to this set of references as proposed
in (NieBen et al., 2000).
• BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy):
(Papineni et al., 2002) have proposed a

method of automatic machine translation
evaluation, which they call "BLEU". It is
based on the notion of modified n-gram pre-
cision, for which all candidate n-gram counts
in the translation are collected and clipped
against their corresponding maximum refer-
ence counts. These clipped candidate counts
are summed and normalized by the total num-
ber of candidate n-grams. Since BLEU ex-
presses quality, we determine 100—BLEU to
transform it into an error measure.
Although these measures are only approximations,
they seem to be sufficient at the present level of
performance of machine translation systems.
6.3 Experimental Results
We compared the two statistical lexica obtained
from the baseline system and from the maximum
entropy training on the transformed corpus. For
the baseline lexicon, we observed an average of
5.82 Catalan translation candidates per English
word and 6.16 Spanish translation candidates.
These numbers are significantly reduced in the
lexicon which was trained on the transformed
corpus using maximum entropy: there, we have an
average of 4.20 for Catalan and 4.46 for Spanish.
Especially for (nominative) English pronouns
(which have many verbs as translation candidates
in the baseline lexicon), the number of translation
candidates was substantially scaled down by a
factor around 4. This shows that our method was
successful in producing a more focused lexicon
probability distribution.
We performed translation experiments with
an implementation of the IBM-4 translation
model (Brown et al., 1993). A description of
the system can be found in (Tillmann and Ney,
2002).
Table 5 presents an assessment of translation qual-
ity for both the language pairs English—Catalan
and English—Spanish. We see that there is a signif-
icant decrease in error rate for the translation into
Catalan. This change is consistent across both er-
ror rates, the WER and 100—BLEU.
For translations from English into Spanish, the
improvement is less substantial. A reason for
this might be that the Spanish vocabulary contains
more entries and the ratio between fullforms and
baseforms is higher: 1.57 for Spanish versus 1.53
for Catalan4 . This makes it more difficult for the
system to choose the correct inflection when gen-
erating a Spanish sentence. We assume that the
extension of our approach to other word classes
than verbs will yield a quality gain for translations
into Spanish.

LC-STAR develop and test corpus that were trans-

lated into Catalan. We see that it is easier for the
system to generate the correct verb inflection in
Catalan if the verb is enriched with the pronoun.
In the baseline system, it happens that words are
inserted — like 'far' as translation of 'will' in the
second example which is incorrect. This can be
avoided by the splicing of words.
In the last example, we see that the baseline
system generates one word each for the English
'I prefer' and does not find the correct translation,
whereas transformations yield an accurate transla-
tion of this expression, because the spliced word
contains sufficient information.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented a method for improving quality of
statistical machine translation from English into
morphologically richer languages like Spanish and
Catalan. Using POS tags as additional knowledge
source, we enrich the English verbs such that they
contain more information relevant for selecting the
correct inflected form in the target language. The
lexicon model was then trained using the maxi-
mum entropy approach, taking the verbs as addi-
tional features.
Results were given for translation from English
into Spanish and Catalan on the LC-STAR cor-
pus which consists of spontaneously spoken dia-
logues in the domain of appointment scheduling
and travel arrangement. Our experiments show
that translation quality can be significantly in-
creased through the use of our approach: the word
error rate on the Catalan development set for ex-
ample decreased by 2.5% absolute.
We plan to investigate other methods of enrich-
ing the English words with information. It will
be interesting to see how other word classes,
e. g. nouns, can be handled in order to improve
quality of translations into languages with a highly
inflected morphology.
