Reviewers for Volume 31
This journal has a knowledgeable and hardworking editorial board, whose members
are listed on the inside front cover of each issue, but for most submissions we also enlist
the aid of specialist reviewers outside the editorial board. The Editor of Computational
Linguistics would like to express his gratitude to the external reviewers listed below who
anonymously reviewed papers for the journal during the preparation of this volume
(Volume 31). Their generosity, judicious judgment, and prompt response substantially
helped us to publish a journal that both is timely and maintains exacting scientific
standards; it is a genuine pleasure to thank them collectively for their dedicated service.
