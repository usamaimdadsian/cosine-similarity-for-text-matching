The recent advances in information retrieval (IR) in this collection of ten original 
papers reflect he wide range of research topics developed at the Center for Intelligent 
Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. W. Bruce 
Croft, the Director of CIIR and the editor of this volume, presents in the preface both 
the history and the impressive research track of the center. The preface also lists the 
topics covered in the collection, reflecting the fact that the majority of the papers deal 
with research in traditional IR or with architecture and implementation issues. Only 
one of the papers tackles new areas, namely the topic detection and tracking problem. 
Surprisingly, none of the papers address one of the most exciting new IR tasks: the 
open-domain textual question-answering task. As one might expect, the papers in this 
volume are of varying quality. However, both the IR researcher and the computational 
linguist will find at least two of the papers outstanding. 
Warren Greiff's paper "The use of exploratory data analysis in information re- 
trieval research" reports on a new line of research that uncovers tatistical regularities 
in novel ways. By analyzing data using the notion of weight of evidence, Greiff ob- 
tains a new formulation of the inverse document frequency (IDF) that generates results 
of the same quality as those obtained using traditional IDF measures. Moreover, this 
data-driven approach is extended to other IR measures, such as term frequency and 
document length. This approach, comprising four incremental models, generates a
ranking formula that is shown to perform similarly to the INQUERY system. Greiff's 
data-driven model has special promise as it allows natural extensions based on ad- 
ditional sources of evidence such as thesaurus terms or phrases. This technique is an 
ideal research vehicle for traditional and modern IR. 
The second paper that presents outstanding new research is "Topic detection and 
tracking: Event clustering as a basis for first story detection" by Ron Papka and James 
Allan. This paper captivates the reader by presenting an overview of the topic detection 
and tracking (TDT) problem, whose purpose is to organize broadcast news stories by 
the real-world events that they discuss. The paper describes the research problems 
considered in all three phases of the TDT and focuses on the solutions developed at 
CIIR for one of the problems, namely the detection problem--that is, identifying when 
new topics have appeared in the news stream. The approach discussed is both practical 
and technically interesting as it presents both new algorithms and modifications of 
existing IR techniques for the TDT problem.

Another strength of the volume comes from the expertise in language modeling 
developed at CIIR. The contribution of language models to several aspects of IR is well 
represented, appealing to researchers interested in statistical natural anguage process- 
ing (NLP). Two different language models are presented. The first model, originally 
introduced by Ponte and Croft (1998), is described from two different perspectives. 
In "Combining approaches to information retrieval," by Bruce Croft, the Ponte and 
Croft language model is considered when dealing with combinations of evidence gen- 
erated by merging retrieval models and strategies. This paper also contains a wealth 
of information, representative of more than ten years of IR research into combining 
retrieval representations, retrieval algorithms, and search results. The same language 
model is also considered in "Language models for relevance feedback" by Jay Ponte, 
where relevance feedback and routing techniques are derived. Ponte's paper supports 
the theoretical findings with extensive xperimental data. 
A different, unigram language model is described in "Topic-based language mod- 
els for distributed retrieval" by Jinxi Xu and Bruce Croft. This new language model, 
called topic model, is used to characterize the content of a specific topic from a given 
collection. In this paper, topics are approximated as document clusters, produced with 
the k-means clustering algorithm (Jain and Dubes 1988). This representation entails 
three new methods for distributed IR, suitable for different environments, including 
dynamic ones. Readers interested in other aspects of distributed IR are presented with 
an excellent account of the techniques involved in resource selection and merging of 
document rankings in Jamie Callan's paper "Distributed information retrieval." This 
paper lists experimental data that demonstrates the effectiveness of distributed IR tech- 
niques. The architecture of distributed IR systems is considered in "The effect of collec- 
tion organization and query locality on information retrieval system performance" by 
Zhihong Lu and Kathryn McKinley. The authors' expertise in distributed and parallel 
systems ports new, interesting research perspectives to the problem of distributed IR. 
The volume also contains papers on automatic derivations of concept hierarchies, 
cross-language r trieval and image retrieval. In "Building, testing, and applying con- 
cept hierarchies," Mark Sanderson and Dawn Lawrie present a method of automati- 
cally devising concept hierarchies based on document term frequencies, a metric that 
was recently used by Caraballo and Charniak (1999) to determine the specificity of 
nouns in texts. In "Cross-language r trieval via transitive translation," Lisa Ballesteros 
presents the CIIR efforts in cross-lingual IR, focusing on a dictionary-based approach. 
In "Appearance-based global similarity retrieval of images," S. Chandu Ravela and 
C. Luo present a technique of computing lobal appearance similarity, which enables 
appearance-based r trieval of images. 
To the computational linguist, this collection of articles has interest for at least 
three reasons. First, the past years have shown that several NLP techniques play a 
central role in one of the most exciting new applications in IR: Open-domain textual 
question answering (Q/A)--that is, the task of producing answers in the form of 
text snippets from a corpus whenever an open-domain atural anguage question is 
posed. 1The development of recent Q/A  systems paved the way to new models of IR 
and especially to novel semantic processing mechanisms, able to operate on more and 
more complex questions and text passages. It is clear that this new interest in semantic 
processing will find its way into mainstream NLP. 
1 Research inthe area of information retrieval has been encouraged bythe Text Retrieval Conference 
(TREC), sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 1999, TREC initiated a
Question-Answering track, whose aim is to foster esearch inthe area of textual Q/A, especially when 
pursued in a domain-independent manner.

Second, NLP approaches incorporating IR techniques or metrics are often practical 
solutions to difficult problems of text processing. Examples are the text segmentation 
method proposed by Hearst (1994, 1997), which employs the cosine similarity used 
in vector 1R models; the dialogue manager described by Chu-Carroll and Carpenter 
(1998) using a routing module based on latent semantic indexing, a technique widely 
used in IR; and the more recent summarization methods of Berger and Mittal (2000) 
based on one of the new language models developed in IR (Ponte and Croft 1998). 
Third, modern IR is both a provider of new language models, to be used in differ- 
ent natural anguage processing tasks, and an application in need of deeper semantic 
processing of language. In summary, the book makes very interesting reading for ca- 
sual or serious developers of IR systems and anyone who is interested in obtaining 
pragmatic knowledge from text passages.
