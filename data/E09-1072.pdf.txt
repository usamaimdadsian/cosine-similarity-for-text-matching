Abstract
This article presents empirical evaluations
of aspects of annotation for the linguis-
tic property of animacy in Swedish, rang-
ing from manual human annotation, auto-
matic classification and, finally, an exter-
nal evaluation in the task of syntactic pars-
ing. We show that a treatment of animacy
as a lexical semantic property of noun
types enables generalization over distri-
butional properties of these nouns which
proves beneficial in automatic classifica-
tion and furthermore gives significant im-
provements in terms of parsing accuracy
for Swedish, compared to a state-of-the-
art baseline parser with gold standard ani-
macy information.
1 Introduction
The property of animacy influences linguistic phe-
nomena in a range of different languages, such
as case marking (Aissen, 2003) and argument re-
alization (Bresnan et al., 2005; de Swart et al.,
2008), and has been shown to constitute an im-
portant factor in the production and comprehen-
sion of syntactic structure (Branigan et al., 2008;
Weckerly and Kutas, 1999).1 In computational
linguistic work, animacy has been shown to pro-
vide important information in anaphora resolution
(Ora?san and Evans, 2007), argument disambigua-
tion (Dell’Orletta et al., 2005) and syntactic pars-
ing in general (Øvrelid and Nivre, 2007).
The dimension of animacy roughly distin-
guishes between entities which are alive and en-
tities which are not, however, other distinctions

derforschungsbereich 632, project D4).
are also relevant and the animacy dimension is of-
ten viewed as a continuum ranging from humans
to inanimate objects. Following Silverstein (1976)
several animacy hierarchies have been proposed in
typological studies, focusing on the linguistic cat-
egory of animacy, i.e., the distinctions which are
relevant for linguistic phenomena. An example of
an animacy hierarchy, taken from (Aissen, 2003),
is provided in (1):
(1) Human > Animate > Inanimate
Clearly, non-human animates, like animals, are
not less animate than humans in a biological sense,
however, humans and animals show differing lin-
guistic behaviour.
Empirical studies of animacy require human an-
notation efforts, and, in particular, a well-defined
annotation task. However, annotation studies of
animacy differ distinctly in their treatment of ani-
macy as a type or token-level phenomenon, as well
as in terms of granularity of categories. The use
of the annotated data as a computational resource
furthermore poses requirements on the annotation
which do not necessarily agree with more theo-
retical considerations. Methods for the induction
of animacy information for use in practical appli-
cations require the resolution of issues of level of
representation, as well as granularity.
This article addresses these issues through em-
pirical and experimental evaluation. We present
an in-depth study of a manually annotated data
set which indicates that animacy may be treated
as a lexical semantic property at the type level.
We then evaluate this proposal through supervised
machine learning of animacy information and fo-
cus on an in-depth error analysis of the resulting
classifier, addressing issues of granularity of the
animacy dimension. Finally, the automatically an-
630
notated data set is employed in order to train a syn-
tactic parser and we investigate the effect of the an-
imacy information and contrast the automatically
acquired features with gold standard ones.
The rest of the article is structured as follows. In
section 2, we briefly discuss annotation schemes
for animacy, the annotation strategies and cate-
gories proposed there. We go on to describe anno-
tation for the binary distinction of ‘human refer-
ence’ found in a Swedish dependency treebank in
section 3 and we perform an evaluation of the con-
sistency of the human annotation in terms of lin-
guistic level. In section 4, we present experiments
in lexical acquisition of animacy based on mor-
phosyntactic features extracted from a consider-
ably larger corpus. Section 5 presents experiments
with the acquired animacy information applied in
the data-driven dependency parsing of Swedish.
Finally, section 6 concludes the article and pro-
vides some suggestions for future research.
2 Animacy annotation
Annotation for animacy is not a common compo-
nent of corpora or treebanks. However, following
from the theoretical interest in the property of an-
imacy, there have been some initiatives directed at
animacy annotation of corpus data.
Corpus studies of animacy (Yamamoto, 1999;
Dahl and Fraurud, 1996) have made use of an-
notated data, however they differ in the extent to
which the annotation has been explicitly formu-
lated as an annotation scheme. The annotation
study presented in Zaenen et. al. (2004) makes use
of a coding manual designed for a project study-
ing genitive modification (Garretson et al., 2004)
and presents an explicit annotation scheme for an-
imacy, illustrated by figure 1. The main class dis-
tinction for animacy is three-way, distinguishing
Human, Other animate and Inanimate, with sub-
classes under two of the main classes. The ‘Other
animate’ class further distinguishes Organizations
and Animals. Within the group of inanimates, fur-
ther distinctions are made between concrete and
non-concrete inanimate, as well as time and place
nominals.2
The annotation scheme described in Zaenen et.
al. (2004) annotates the markables according to
2The fact that the study focuses on genitival modification
has clearly influenced the categories distinguished, as these
are all distinctions which have been claimed to influence the
choice of genitive construction. For instance, temporal nouns
are frequent in genitive constructions, unlike the other inani-
mate nouns.
the animacy of their referent in the particular con-
text. Animacy is thus treated as a token level
property, however, has also been proposed as a
lexical semantic property of nouns (Yamamoto,
1999). The indirect encoding of animacy in lex-
ical resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
can also be seen as treating animacy as a type-
level property. We may thus distinguish between a
purely type level annotation strategy and a purely
token level one. Type level properties hold for lex-
emes and are context-independent, i.e., indepen-
dent of the particular linguistic context, whereas
token-level properties are determined in context
and hold for referring expressions, rather than lex-
emes.
3 Human reference in Swedish
Talbanken05 is a Swedish treebank which was
created in the 1970’s and which has recently
been converted to dependency format (Nivre et
al., 2006b) and made freely available. The writ-
ten sections of the treebank consist of profes-
sional prose and student essays and amount to
197,123 running tokens, spread over 11,431 sen-
tences. Figure 2 shows the labeled dependency
graph of example (2), taken from Talbanken05.

In addition to information on part-of-speech, de-
pendency head and relation, and various mor-
phosyntactic properties such as definiteness, the
annotation expresses a distinction for nominal el-
ements between reference to human and non-
human. The annotation manual (Teleman, 1974)
states that a markable should be tagged as human
(HH) if it may be replaced by the interrogative pro-
noun vem ‘who’ and be referred to by the personal
pronouns han ‘he’ or hon ‘she’.
There are clear similarities between the anno-
tation for human reference found in Talbanken05
and the annotation scheme for animacy discussed

above. The human/non-human contrast forms the
central distinction in the animacy dimension and,
in this respect, the annotation schemes do not con-
flict. If we compare the annotation found in Tal-
banken05 with the annotation proposed in Zaenen
et. al. (2004), we find that the schemes differ pri-
marily in the granularity of classes distinguished.
The main source of variation in class distinctions
consists in the annotation of collective nouns, in-
cluding organizations, as well as animals.
3.1 Level of annotation
We distinguished above between type and token
level annotation strategies, where a type level an-
notation strategy entails that an element consis-
tently be assigned to only one class. A token level
strategy, in contrast, does not impose this restric-
tion on the annotation and class assignment may
vary depending on the specific context. Garretson
et. al (2004) propose a token level annotation strat-
egy and state that “when coding for animacy [. . . ]
we are not considering the nominal per se (e.g., the
word ‘church’), but rather the entity that is the ref-
erent of that nominal (e.g. some particular thing in
the real world)”. This indicates that for all possible
markables, a referent should be determinable.
The brief instruction with respect to annotation
for human reference in the annotation manual for
Talbanken05 (Teleman, 1974, 223) gives leeway
for interpretation in the annotation and does not
clearly state that it should be based on token level
reference in context. It may thus be interesting
to examine the extent to which this manual an-
notation is consistent across lexemes or whether
we observe variation. We manually examine the
intersection of the two classes of noun lemmas
in the written sections of Talbanken, i.e., the set
of nouns which have been assigned both classes
by the annotators. It contains 82 noun lemmas,
which corresponds to only 1.1% of the total num-
ber of noun lemmas in the treebank (7554 lem-
mas all together). After a manual inspection of
the intersective elements along with their linguis-
tic contexts, we may group the nouns which were
assigned to both classes, into the following cate-
gories:that ‘HH’ is the tag for
Abstract nouns Nouns with underspecified or
vague type level properties with respect to ani-
macy, such as quantifying nouns, e.g. ha¨lft ‘half’,
miljon ‘million’, as well as nouns which may be
employed with varying animacy, e.g. element ‘el-
ement’, part ‘party’, as in (3) and (4):

‘In a relationship, both parties are never equally

We also find that nouns which denote abstract con-
cepts regarding humans show variable annotation,
e.g. individ ‘individual’, adressat ‘addressee’,
medlem ‘member’, kandidat ‘candidate’, repre-
sentant ‘representative’, auktoritet ‘authority’
Reference shifting contexts These are nouns
whose type level animacy is clear but which are
employed in a specific context which shifts their
reference. Examples include metonymic usage of
nouns, as in (5) and nouns occurring in derefer-
encing constructions, such as predicative construc-
tions (6), titles (7) and idioms (8):

It is interesting to note that the main variation in
annotation stems precisely from difficulties in de-
termining reference, either due to bleak type level
properties such as for the abstract nouns, or due to
properties of the context, as in the reference shift-
ing constructions. The small amount of variation
in the human annotation for animacy clearly sup-
ports a type-level approach to animacy, however,
underline the influence of the linguistic context on
the conception of animacy, as noted in the litera-
ture (Zaenen et al., 2004; Rosenbach, 2008).
4 Lexical acquisition of animacy
Even though knowledge about the animacy of a
noun clearly has some interesting implications, lit-
tle work has been done within the field of lexical
acquisition in order to automatically acquire ani-
macy information. Ora?san and Evans (2007) make
use of hyponym-relations taken from the Word-
Net resource in order to classify animate referents.
However, such a method is clearly restricted to
languages for which large scale lexical resources,
such as the WordNet, are available. The task of
animacy classification bears some resemblance to
the task of named entity recognition (NER) which
usually makes reference to a ‘person’ class. How-
ever, whereas most NER systems make extensive
use of orthographic, morphological or contextual
clues (titles, suffixes) and gazetteers, animacy for
nouns is not signaled overtly in the same way.
Following a strategy in line with work on
verb classification (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001;
Stevenson and Joanis, 2003), we set out to clas-
sify common noun lemmas based on their mor-
phosyntactic distribution in a considerably larger
corpus. This is thus equivalent to treatment of
animacy as a lexical semantic property and the
classification strategy is based on generalization
of morphosyntactic behaviour of common nouns
over large quantities of data. Due to the small size
of the Talbanken05 treebank and the small amount
of variation, this strategy was pursued for the ac-
quisition of animacy information.
In the animacy classification of common nouns
we exploit well-documented correlations between
morphosyntactic realization and semantic proper-
ties of nouns. For instance, animate nouns tend to
be realized as agentive subjects, inanimate nouns
do not (Dahl and Fraurud, 1996). Animate nouns
make good ‘possessors’, whereas inanimate nouns
are more likely ‘possessees’ (Rosenbach, 2008).

for common nouns in Talbanken05. It is clear that
the data is highly skewed towards the non-human
class, which accounts for 91.5% of the type in-
stances. For classification we organize the data
into accumulated frequency bins, which include
all nouns with frequencies above a certain thresh-
old. We here approximate the class of ‘animate’
to ‘human’ and the class of ‘inanimate’ to ‘non-
human’. Intersective elements, see section 3.1, are
assigned to their majority class.3
4.1 Features for animacy classification
We define a feature space, which makes use of
distributional data regarding the general syntactic
properties of a noun, as well as various morpho-
logical properties. It is clear that in order for a
syntactic environment to be relevant for animacy
classification it must be, at least potentially, nom-
inal. We define the nominal potential of a depen-
dency relation as the frequency with which it is
realized by a nominal element (noun or pronoun)
and determine empirically a threshold of .10. The
syntactic and morphological features in the feature
space are presented below:
Syntactic features A feature for each depen-
dency relation with nominal potential: (tran-
sitive) subject (SUBJ), object (OBJ), preposi-
tional complement (PA), root (ROOT)4, ap-
position (APP), conjunct (CC), determiner
(DET), predicative (PRD), complement of
comparative subjunction (UK). We also in-
clude a feature for the head of a genitive mod-
ifier, the so-called ‘possessee’, (GENHD).
Morphological features A feature for each mor-
phological distinction relevant for a noun
3When there is no majority class, i.e. in the case of ties,
the noun is removed from the data set. 12 lemmas were con-
sequently removed.
4Nominal elements may be assigned the root relation of
the dependency graph in sentence fragments which do not
contain a finite verb.

in Swedish: gender (NEU/UTR), num-
ber (SIN/PLU), definiteness (DEF/IND), case
(NOM/GEN). Also, the part-of-speech tags
distinguish dates (DAT) and quantifying
nouns (SET), e.g. del, rad ‘part, row’, so
these are also included as features.
For extraction of distributional data for the set of
Swedish nouns we make use of the Swedish Pa-
role corpus of 21.5M tokens.5 To facilitate feature
extraction, we part-of-speech tag the corpus and
parse it with MaltParser6, which assigns a depen-
dency analysis.7
4.2 Experimental methodology
For machine learning, we make use of the Tilburg
Memory-Based Learner (TiMBL) (Daelemans et
al., 2004).8 Memory-based learning is a super-
vised machine learning method characterized by
a lazy learning algorithm which postpones learn-
ing until classification time, using the k-nearest
neighbor algorithm for the classification of unseen
instances. For animacy classification, the TiMBL
parameters are optimized on a subset of the full
data set.9
For training and testing of the classifiers, we
make use of leave-one-out cross-validation. The
baseline represents assignment of the majority
class (inanimate) to all nouns in the data set. Due
to the skewed distribution of classes, as noted
above, the baseline accuracy is very high, usu-
ally around 90%.Clearly, however, the class-based
measures of precision and recall, as well as the
combined F-score measure are more informative
for these results. The baseline F-score for the ani-
mate class is thus 0, and a main goal is to improve
on the rate of true positives for animates, while
limiting the trade-off in terms of performance for

7For part-of-speech tagging, we employ the MaltTagger
– a HMM part-of-speech tagger for Swedish (Hall, 2003).
For parsing, we employ MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2006a),
a language-independent system for data-driven dependency
parsing , with the pretrained model for Swedish, which has
been trained on the tags output by the tagger.

9For parameter optimization we employ the
paramsearch tool, supplied with TiMBL, see
http://ilk.uvt.nl/software.html. Paramsearch implements
a hill climbing search for the optimal settings on iteratively
larger parts of the supplied data. We performed parameter
optimization on 20% of the total data set, where we balanced
the data with respect to frequency. The resulting settings are

with F-scores approaching 100. For calculation of
the statistical significance of differences in the per-
formance of classifiers tested on the same data set,
McNemar’s test (Dietterich, 1998) is employed.
4.3 Results
Column four (MBL) in table 2 shows the accu-
racy obtained with all features in the general fea-
ture space. We observe a clear improvement on
all data sets (p<.0001), compared to the respec-
tive baselines. As we recall, the data sets are suc-
cessively larger, hence it seems fair to conclude
that the size of the data set partially counteracts
the lower frequency of the test nouns. It is not
surprising, however, that a method based on dis-
tributional features suffers when the absolute fre-
quencies approach 1. We obtain results for ani-
macy classification, ranging from 97.3% accuracy
to 93.9% depending on the sparsity of the data.
With an absolute frequency threshold of 10, we
obtain an accuracy of 95.4%, which constitutes a
50% reduction of error rate.
Table 3 presents the experimental results rela-
tive to class. We find that classification of the inan-
imate class is quite stable throughout the experi-
ments, whereas the classification of the minority
class of animate nouns suffers from sparse data. It
is an important point, however, that it is largely re-
call for the animate class which goes down with
increased sparseness, whereas precision remains
quite stable. All of these properties are clearly ad-
vantageous in the application to realistic data sets,
where a more conservative classifier is to be pre-
ferred.

animacy dimension. An interesting question is
whether the errors show evidence of the gradi-
ence in categories discussed earlier and explic-
itly expressed in the annotation scheme by Zaenen
et.al. (2004) in figure 1. If so, we would expect
erroneously classified inanimate nouns to contain
nouns of intermediate animacy, such as animals
and organizations.
The error analysis examines the performance of
the MBL-classifier employing all features on the
> 10 data set in order to abstract away from the
most serious effects of data sparseness. Table 4
shows a confusion matrix for the classification of
the nouns. If we examine the errors for the inan-
imate class we indeed find evidence of gradience
within this category. The errors contain a group
of nouns referring to animals and other living be-
ings (bacteria, algae), as listed in (9), as well as
one noun referring to an “intelligent machine”, in-
cluded in the intermediate animacy category in Za-
enen et al. (2004). Collective nouns with human
reference and organizations are also found among
the errors, listed in (11). We also find some nouns
among the errors with human denotation, listed in
(12). These are nouns which typically occur in
dereferencing contexts, such as titles, e.g. herr
‘mister’, biskop ‘bishop’ and which were anno-
tated as non-human referring by the human an-
notators.10 Finally, a group of abstract, human-
10In fact, both of these showed variable annotation in the
treebank and were assigned their majority class – inanimate
denoting nouns are also found among the errors, as
listed in (13). In summary, we find that nouns with
gradient animacy properties account for 53.1% of
the errors for the inanimate class.

alg ‘algae’, apa ‘monkey’, bakterie ‘bacteria’, bjo¨rn
‘bear’, djur ‘animal’, fa?gel ‘bird’, fladdermo¨ss ‘bat’,
myra ‘ant’, ma?s ‘seagull’, parasit ‘parasite’
(10) Intelligent machines:

‘nationalist’, tolk ‘interpreter’
(13) Abstract, human nouns:
fo¨rlorare ‘loser’, huvudpart ‘main-party’, konkurrent
‘competitor’, majoritet ‘majority’, va¨rd ‘host’
It is interesting to note that both the hu-
man and automatic annotation showed difficul-
ties in ascertaining class for a group of ab-
stract, human-denoting nouns, like individ ‘indi-
vidual’, motsta?ndare ‘opponent’, kandidat ‘candi-
date’, representant ‘representative’. These were
all assigned to the animate majority class dur-
ing extraction, but were misclassified as inanimate
during classification.
4.5 SVM classifiers
In order to evaluate whether the classification
method generalizes to a different machine learn-
ing algorithm, we design an identical set of experi-
ments to the ones presented above, but where clas-
sification is performed with Support Vector Ma-
chines (SVMs) instead of MBL. We use the LIB-
SVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001) with a RBF
kernel (C = 8.0, ? = 0.5).11
– in the extraction of training data.
11As in the MBL-experiment, parameter optimization, i.e.,
choice of kernel function, C and ? values, is performed on
20% of the total data set with the easy.py tool, supplied
with LIBSVM.
635
As column 5 (SVM) in table 2 shows, the clas-
sification results are very similar to the results ob-
tained with MBL.12 We furthermore find a very
similar set of errors, and in particular, we find that
51.0 % of the errors for the inanimate class are
nouns with the gradient animacy properties pre-
sented in (9)-(13) above.
5 Parsing with animacy information
As an external evaluation of our animacy classi-
fier, we apply the induced information to the task
of syntactic parsing. Seeing that we have a tree-
bank with gold standard syntactic information and
gold standard as well as induced animacy informa-
tion, it should be possible to study the direct effect
of the added animacy information in the assign-
ment of syntactic structure.
5.1 Experimental methodology
We use the freely available MaltParser system,
which is a language-independent system for data-
driven dependency parsing (Nivre, 2006; Nivre et
al., 2006c). A set of parsers are trained on Tal-
banken05, both with and without additional an-
imacy information, the origin of which is either
the manual annotation described in section 3 or
the automatic animacy classifier described in sec-
tion 4.2- 4.4 (MBL). The common nouns in the
treebank are classified for animacy using leave-
one-out training and testing. This ensures that
the training and test instances are disjoint at all
times. Moreover, the fact that the distributional
data is taken from a separate data set ensures non-
circularity since we are not basing the classifica-
tion on gold standard parses.
All parsing experiments are performed using
10-fold cross-validation for training and testing on
the entire written part of Talbanken05. Overall
parsing accuracy will be reported using the stan-
dard metrics of labeled attachment score (LAS)
and unlabeled attachment score (UAS).13 Statis-
tical significance is checked using Dan Bikel’s
randomized parsing evaluation comparator.14 As
our baseline, we use the settings optimized for
Swedish in the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz

sults, however, only performance on the >1000 data set is
significantly lower (p<.05).

5.2 Results
The addition of automatically assigned animacy
information for common nouns (Anim) causes a
small, but significant improvement in overall re-
sults (p<.04) compared to the baseline, as well
as the corresponding gold standard experiment
(p<.04). In the gold standard experiment, the re-
sults are not significantly better than the baseline
and the main, overall, improvement from the gold
standard animacy information reported in Øvrelid
and Nivre (2007) and Øvrelid (2008) stems largely
from the animacy annotation of pronouns.15 This
indicates that the animacy information for com-
mon nouns, which has been automatically ac-
quired from a considerably larger corpus, captures
distributional distinctions which are important for
the general effect of animacy and furthermore that
the differences from the gold standard annotation
prove beneficial for the results.
We see from Table 5, that the improvement in
overall parse results is mainly in terms of depen-
dency labeling, reflected in the LAS score. A
closer error analysis shows that the performance
of the two parsers employing gold and automatic
animacy information is very similar with respect
to dependency relations and we observe an im-
proved analysis for subjects, (direct and indirect)
objects and subject predicatives with only minor
variations. This in itself is remarkable, since the
covered set of animate instances is notably smaller
in the automatically annotated data set. We fur-
thermore find that the main difference between the
gold standard and automatic Anim-experiments
15Recall that the Talbanken05 treebank contains animacy
information for all nominal elements – pronouns, proper and
common nouns. When the totality of this information is
added the overall parse results are significantly improved
(p<.0002) (Øvrelid and Nivre, 2007; Øvrelid, 2008).

does not reside in the analysis of syntactic argu-
ments, but rather of non-arguments. One rela-
tion for which performance deteriorates with the
added information in the gold Anim-experiment
is the nominal postmodifier relation (ET) which
is employed for relative clauses and nominal PP-
attachment. With the automatically assigned fea-
ture, in contrast, we observe an improvement in
the performance for the ET relation, compared to
the gold standard experiment, from a F-score in
the latter of 76.14 to 76.40 in the former. Since
this is a quite common relation, with a frequency
of 5% in the treebank as a whole, the improvement
has a clear effect on the results.
The parser’s analysis of postnominal modifica-
tion is influenced by the differences in the added
animacy annotation for the nominal head, as well
as the internal dependent. If we examine the cor-
rected errors in the automatic experiment, com-
pared to the gold standard experiment, we find ele-
ments with differing annotation. Preferences with
respect to the animacy of prepositional comple-
ments vary. In (14), the automatic annotation of
the noun djur ‘animal’ as animate results in cor-
rect assignment of the ET relation to the prepo-
sition hos ‘among’, as well as correct nominal,
as opposed to verbal, attachment. This preposi-
tion is one of the few with a preference for an-
imate complements in the treebank. In contrast,
the example in (15) illustrates an error where the
automatic classification of barn ‘children’ as inan-
imate causes a correct analysis of the head prepo-
sition om ‘about’.16

A more thorough analysis of the different factors
involved in PP-attachment is a complex task which
is clearly beyond the scope of the present study.
We may note, however, that the distinctions in-
duced by the animacy classifier based purely on
linguistic evidence proves useful for the analysis
of both arguments and non-arguments.
16Recall that the classification is based purely on linguistic
evidence and in this respect children largely pattern with the
inanimate nouns. A child is probably more like a physical
object in the sense that it is something one possesses and oth-
erwise reacts to, rather than being an agent that acts upon its
surroundings.
6 Conclusion
This article has dealt with an empirical evaluation
of animacy annotation in Swedish, where the main
focus has been on the use of such annotation for
computational purposes.
We have seen that human annotation for ani-
macy shows little variation at the type-level for
a binary animacy distinction. Following from
this observation, we have shown how a type-
level induction strategy based on morphosyntac-
tic distributional features enables automatic ani-
macy classification for noun lemmas which fur-
thermore generalizes to different machine learning
algorithms (MBL, SVM). We obtain results for an-
imacy classification, ranging from 97.3% accuracy
to 93.9% depending on the sparsity of the data.
With an absolute frequency threshold of 10, we
obtain an accuracy of 95.4%, which constitutes a
50% reduction of error rate. A detailed error anal-
ysis revealed some interesting results and we saw
that more than half of the errors performed by the
animacy classifier for the large class of inanimate
nouns actually included elements which have been
assigned an intermediate animacy status in theo-
retical work, such as animals and collective nouns.
The application of animacy annotation in the
task of syntactic parsing provided a test bed for
the applicability of the annotation, where we could
contrast the manually assigned classes with the
automatically acquired ones. The results showed
that the automatically acquired information gives
a slight, but significant improvement of overall
parse results where the gold standard annotation
does not, despite a considerably lower coverage.
This is a suprising result which highlights impor-
tant properties of the annotation. First of all, the
automatic annotation is completely consistent at
the type level. Second, the automatic animacy
classifier captures important distributional proper-
ties of the nouns, exemplified by the case of nom-
inal postmodifiers in PP-attachment. The auto-
matic annotation thus captures a purely linguistic
notion of animacy and abstracts over contextual
influence in particular instances.
Animacy has been shown to be an important
property in a range of languages, hence animacy
classification of other languages constitutes an in-
teresting line of work for the future, where empir-
ical evaluations may point to similarities and dif-
ferences in the linguistic expression of animacy.
