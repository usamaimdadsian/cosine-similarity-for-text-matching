Abstract
Automated mining of novel documents
or sentences from chronologically ordered
documents or sentences is an open chal-
lenge in text mining. In this paper, we
describe the preprocessing techniques for
detecting novel Chinese text and discuss
the influence of different Part of Speech
(POS) filtering rules on the detection per-
formance. Experimental results on AP-
WSJ and TREC 2004 Novelty Track data
show that the Chinese novelty mining per-
formance is quite different when choosing
two dissimilar POS filtering rules. Thus,
the selection of words to represent Chinese
text is of vital importance to the success of
the Chinese novelty mining. Moreover, we
compare the Chinese novelty mining per-
formance with that of English and investi-
gate the impact of preprocessing steps on
detecting novel Chinese text, which will
be very helpful for developing a Chinese
novelty mining system.
1 Introduction
The bloom of information nowadays brings us rich
useful information as well as tons of redundant in-
formation in news articles, social networks (Tsai et
al., 2009), and blogs (Chen et al., 2008). Novelty
mining (NM), or novelty detection, aims at mining
novel information from a chronologically ordered
list of relevant documents/sentences. It can facil-
itate users to quickly get useful information with-
out going through a lot of redundant information,
which is usually a tedious and time-consuming
task.
The process of detecting novel text contains
three main steps, (i) preprocessing, (ii) cate-
gorization, and (iii) novelty mining. The first
step preprocesses the text documents/sentences
by removing stop words, performing word stem-
ming, implementing POS tagging etc. Categoriza-
tion classifies each incoming document/sentence
into its relevant topic bin. Then, within each
topic bin containing a group of relevant docu-
ments/sentences, novelty mining searches through
the time sequence of documents/sentences and re-
trieves only those with “novel” information. This
paper focuses on applying document/sentence-
level novelty mining on Chinese. In this task,
we need to identify all novel Chinese text given
groups of relevant documents/sentences.
Novelty mining has been performed at three dif-
ferent levels: event level, sentence level and doc-
ument level (Li and Croft, 2005). Works on nov-
elty mining at the event level originated from re-
search on Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT),
which is concerned with online new event detec-
tion/first story detection (Allan et al., 1998; Yang
et al., 2002; Stokes and Carthy, 2001; Franz et
al., 2001; Brants et al., 2003). Research on doc-
ument and sentence-level novelty mining aims to
find relevant and novel documents/sentences given
a stream of documents/sentences. Previous stud-
ies on document and sentence-level novelty min-
ing tend to apply some promising content-oriented
techniques (Li and Croft, 2005; Allan et al., 1998;
Yang et al., 1998; Zhang and Tsai, 2009). Simi-
larity metrics that can be used for detecting novel
text are word overlap, cosine similarity (Yang et
al., 1998), new word count (Brants et al., 2003),
etc. Other works utilize ontological knowledge,
especially taxonomy, such as WordNet (Zhang et
al., 2002; Allan et al., 2003), synonym dictionary
(Franz et al., 2001), HowNet (Eichmann and Srini-
vasan, 2002), etc.
Previous studies for novelty mining have been
conducted on the English and Malay languages
(Kwee et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009; Tang and
Tsai, 2009). Novelty mining studies on the Chi-
nese language have been performed on topic de-
1561
tection and tracking, which identifies and collects
relevant stories on certain topics from information
stream (Zheng et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2008).
Also many works have discussed the issues, such
as word segmentation, POS tagging etc, between
English and Chinese (Wang et al., 2006; Wu et
al., 2003). However, to the best of our knowledge,
no studies have been reported on discussing pre-
processing techniques on Chinese document and
sentence-level novelty mining, which is the focus
of our paper.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 gives a brief overview of related work on
detecting novel documents and sentences on En-
glish and Chinese. Section 3 introduces the details
of preprocessing steps for English and Chinese.
A general novelty mining algorithm is described
in Section 4. Section 5 reports experimental re-
sults. Section 6 summarizes the research findings
and discusses issues for further research.
2 Related Work
In the pioneering work for detecting novel doc-
uments (Zhang et al., 2002), document novelty
was predicted based on the distance between the
new document and the previously delivered doc-
uments in history. The detected document which
is very similar to any of its history documents is
regarded as a redundant document. To serve users
better, it could be more helpful to further highlight
novel information at the sentence level. Therefore,
later studies focused on detecting novel sentences,
such as those reported in TREC 2002-2004 Nov-
elty Tracks (Harman, 2002; Soboroff and Harman,
2003; Soboroff, 2004), which compared various
novelty metrics (Allan et al., 2003), and integrated
different natural language techniques (Ng et al.,
2007; Li and Croft, 2008).
Although novelty mining studies have mainly
been conducted on the English language, stud-
ies on the Chinese language have been performed
on topic detection and tracking. A prior study
(Zheng et al., 2008) proposed an improved rel-
evance model to detect the novelty information
in topic tracking feedback and modified the topic
model based on this information. Experimental
results on Chinese datasets TDT4 and TDT2003
proved the effectiveness in topic tracking. Another
study proposed a method of applying semantic do-
main language model to link detection, based on
the structure relation among contents and the se-
mantic distribution in a story (Hong et al., 2008).
3 Preprocessing for English and Chinese
3.1 English
Since the focus of this paper is on novelty min-
ing, we begin from a list of relevant documents or
sentences that have already undergone the catego-
rization process.
The first step for English preprocessing is to re-
move all stop words from documents or sentences,
such as conjunctions, prepositions, and articles.
Stop words are words that are too common to
be informative. These words should be removed,
otherwise it will influence the novelty prediction
of documents or sentences. After stop words re-
moval, the remaining words are then stemmed.
The inflected (or sometimes derived) words are
reduced to their root forms. This paper used
Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1997) for En-
glish word stemming. This algorithm removes the
commoner morphological and inflexional endings
from the words in English. The entire preprocess-
ing steps in English novelty mining can be seen in
Figure 1.
3.2 Chinese
In Chinese, the word is the smallest independent
meaningful element. There is no obvious bound-
ary between words so that Chinese lexical anal-
ysis, such as Chinese word segmentation, is the
prerequisite for novelty mining.
Unlike English, Chinese word segmentation
is a very challenging problem because of the
difficulties in defining what constitutes a word
(Gao et al., 2005). While each criteria pro-
vides valuable insights into “word-hood” in Chi-
nese, they do not consistently lead us to the
same conclusions. Moreover, there is no white
space between Chinese words or expressions
and there are many ambiguities in the Chinese
language, such as: ‘??????’ (means
‘mainboard and server’ in English) might be ‘?
?/?/???’ (means ‘mainboard/and/server’ in
English) or ‘??/??/?/?’ (means ‘main-
board/kimono/task/utensil’ in English). This am-
biguity is a great challenge for Chinese word seg-
mentation. In addition, there is no obvious in-
flected or derived words in Chinese so that word
stemming is not applicable.
Therefore, in order to reduce the noise brought
by Chinese word segmentation and get a better

word list for one document or sentence, we firstly
apply word segmentation on the Chinese text and
then utilize Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging to se-
lect the meaningful candidate words. Figure 2
shows the preprocessing steps on the Chinese text
for novelty mining. POS tagging is a process of
marking up the word in a text as corresponding
to a particular part of speech. It is learnt that the
idea of a text mainly relies on some meaningful
words, such as nouns and verbs, so that we can get
the main content by extracting these meaningful
words. Moreover, it will decrease the impact of
the errors in Chinese word segmentation on nov-
elty mining because only meaningful words are
considered and other words (including stop words)
such as ‘??’ (means ‘although’ in English) will
not appear in the word list for the following sim-
ilarity computation in novelty mining. Losee also
mentioned that POS tagging shows a great poten-
tial to avoid lexical ambiguity and it can help to
improve the performance of information retrieval
(Losee, 2001).
ICTCLAS is used when performing word seg-
mentation and POS tagging in our experiments
(ICTCLAS, 2008). It is an open source project
and achieves a better precision in Chinese word
segmentation and POS tagging than other Chi-
nese POS tagging softwares (ICTCLAS, 2008).
First, we apply word segmentation on the relevant
Chinese documents/sentences. Chinese word seg-
mentation includes atom segmentation, N-shortest
path based rough segmentation and unknown
words recognition (see Figure 3). Atom segmen-
tation is an initial step of the Chinese language
segmentation process, where atom is defined to
be the minimal unit that cannot be split further.
The atom can be a Chinese character, punctua-
tion, symbol string, etc. Then, rough segmentation
tries to discover the correct segmentation with as
few candidates as possible. The N-Shortest Path
(NSP) method (Zhang and Liu, 2002) is applied
for rough segmentation. Next, we detect some un-
known words such as person name, location name
so as to optimize the segmentation result. Finally,
we POS tag the words and keep some kinds of
words in the word list according to the selective
rule, which are used in novelty mining.
4 Novelty Mining
From the output of preprocessing, we can obtain a
bag of words. The corresponding term-document
matrix (TDM)/term-sentence matrix (TSM) can be
constructed by counting the term frequency (TF)
of each word. The novelty mining system predicts
any incoming document/sentence by comparing it
with its history documents/sentences in this vector
space. Therefore, given a Chinese TDM/TSM, the
novelty mining system designed for English can
also be applied to Chinese.
In novelty mining, the novelty of a docu-
ment/sentence can be quantitatively measured by a
novelty metric and represented by a novelty score.
The most popular novelty metric, i.e. cosine sim-
ilarity (see (Allan et al., 2003)), is adopted. This
metric first calculates the similarities between the
current document/sentence d
t
and each of its his-

Then, the novelty score is simply one minus the
maximum of these cosine similarities, as shown in
Eq.(1).

element in the document/sentence
weighted vector d. The term weighting function
used in our work is TF(term frequency).
The final decision on whether a docu-
ment/sentence is novel or not depends on whether
the novelty score falls above or below a thresh-
old. The document/sentence predicted as “novel”
will be placed into the list of history docu-
ments/sentences.
5 Experiments and Results
5.1 Datasets
Two public datasets APWSJ (Zhang et al., 2002)
and TREC Novelty Track 2004 (Soboroff, 2004)
are selected as our experimental datasets for the
document-level and the sentence-level novelty
mining respectively. APWSJ data consists of
news articles from Associated Press (AP) and Wall
Street Journal (WSJ). There are 50 topics from
Q101 to Q150 in APWSJ and 5 topics (Q131,
Q142, Q145, Q147, Q150) are excluded from the

experiments because they lack non-novel docu-
ments (Zhao et al., 2006). The assessors provide
two degrees of judgements on non-novel docu-
ments, absolute redundant and somewhat redun-
dant. In our experiments, we adopt the strict defi-
nition used in (Zhang et al., 2002) where only ab-
solute redundant documents are regarded as non-
novel. TREC 2004 Novelty Track data is devel-
oped from AQUAINT collection. Both relevant
and novel sentences are selected by TREC’s asses-
sors. The statistics of these two datasets are sum-
marized in Table 1.
5.2 Evaluation Measures
From many previous works, redundancy precision
(RP ), redundancy recall (RR) and redundancy F
Score (RF ) are used to evaluate the performance
of document-level novelty mining (Zhang et al.,
2002). Precision (P ), recall (R) and F Score (F )
are mainly used in evaluating the performance for
sentence-level novelty mining (Allan et al., 2003).
Therefore, we use RP , RR, RF and redundancy
precision-recall (R-PR) curve to evaluate our ex-
perimental results on the document level. P , R, F
and precision-recall (PR) curve are used to eval-
uate the performance on the sentence-level nov-
elty mining. The larger the area under the R-PR

we drew the standard redundancy F Score/F Score
contours (Soboroff, 2004), which indicate the F
Score values when setting precision and recall
from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.1. These contours can
facilitate us to compare redundancy F Scores/F
Scores in R-PR curves/PR curves. Redundancy

5.3 Experimental Results
In this experimental study, the focus was novelty
mining rather than relevant documents/sentences
categorization. Therefore, our experiments started
with all given relevant Chinese text, from which
the novel text should be identified.
Since the datasets that we used for document-
level novelty mining and sentence-level novelty
mining both were written in English, we first trans-
lated them into Chinese. During this process,
we investigated issues on machine translation vs.
manually corrected translation.
We compared the novelty mining performance
on 107 text in TREC 2004 Novelty Track between
automatically translated using Google Translate
API
1
and the manually corrected translation. For
example, here is an English sentence in Topic 51:
According to a Chilean government report, a
total of 4,299 political opponents died or disap-
peared during Pinochet’s term.
After machine translation using Google Trans-
lator, the above sentence is translated as:
????????????4299?????
??????????????
1
http://code.google.com/p/google-api-translate-java
1565
Then we manually corrected the machine trans-
lation and obtained the corrected translation:
???????????????????
????4299????????
After novelty mining on the machine transla-
tion sentences and the humanly corrected transla-
tion sentences individually, we found that there is
a slight difference (<2%) in precision and F Score.
Thus, we used machine translation to translate the
remaining documents/sentences to Chinese. This
indicates that the noise in machine translation for
Chinese had little impact on our actual results.
Then on English text, we applied the prepro-
cessing steps discussed in Section 3.1, includ-
ing stop word removing and word stemming.
For Chinese datasets, we segmented the docu-
ments/sentences into words and then performed
POS filtering to acquire the candidate words for
the space vector.
Based on the vectors of Chinese text, we
calculated the similarities between docu-
ments/sentences and predicted the novelty
for each document/sentence in the Chinese and
English datasets. An incoming Chinese/English
document will be compared with all the system
delivered 10 novel documents. If the novelty score
is above the novelty score threshold, the document
is considered to be novel. Thresholds used were
between 0.05 and 0.65. We also performed
Chinese/English sentence-level novelty mining.
Whether an incoming Chinese/English sentence
is novel is predicted by comparing with the most
recent system-delivered 1000 novel sentences.
Thresholds adopted were between 0.05 and 0.95
with an equal step of 0.10. Then, we evaluated the
Chinese/English novel text detection performance
by setting a series of novelty score thresholds.
5.3.1 POS Filtering Rule
We adopted two different rules to select the can-
didate words to represent one document/sentence
and investigated the POS filtering influence on de-
tecting the novel Chinese text.
• Rule1: only some non-meaningful words,
including pronouns (‘r’ in Peking Univer-
sity/Chinese Academy of Sciences Chinese
POS tagging criterions (PKU and CAS,
1999)), auxiliary words (‘u’), tone words
(‘y’), conjunctions (‘c’), prepositions (‘p’)
and punctuation words (‘w’) are removed.
• Rule2: fewer kinds of words are selected to
represent a document/sentence. Only nouns
(including ‘n’ short for common nouns, ‘nr’
short for person name, ‘ns’ short for location
name, ‘nt’ short for organization name, ‘nz’
short for other proper nouns), verbs (‘v’), ad-
jectives (‘a’) and adverbs (‘d’) are kept.
For example, here is a simple Chinese sen-
tence: “????????” (There is a picture
on the wall). After POS filtering using Rule1,
the words we keep are: “?(‘n’),?(‘v’),?(‘v’),
?(‘m’), ?(‘q’), ?(‘n’)”. After POS filtering
using Rule2, the remaining words are: “?(‘n’),
?(‘v’), ?(‘v’), ?(‘n’)”. It is noticed that by
using Rule2, we can remove more non-important
words.
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the performances
on the document and sentence-level novelty min-
ing when choosing the stricter rule (Rule2) and
the less strict rule (Rule1) in POS filtering. The
grey dashed lines show contours at intervals of 0.1
points of F Score.
From Figure 4 and Figure 5, we learn that the
Chinese novelty mining performance varies when
choosing the stricter rule (Rule2) and the less strict
rule (Rule1) in POS filtering. We can obtain a
better performance when choosing a stricter rule
(Rule2). Therefore, it is necessary to perform POS
filtering in the preprocessing steps on Chinese and
just removing some non-meaningful words (like
stop words) may not be enough. POS filtering
can help to remove the less meaningful words so
that each vector is represented better. Compared to
choosing more kinds of words (Rule1), only keep-
ing nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs (Rule2)
will be a better choice for novelty mining. We
also noticed that the selection of words to repre-
sent Chinese text is of vital importance to the suc-
cess of Chinese novelty mining.
5.3.2 Comparison with English
We compared the novelty mining performance
on the English and Chinese documents/sentences
datasets. For Chinese, we chose Rule2 to select
the candidate words. Figure 6 and Figure 7 show
the R-PR and PR curves of document/sentence-
level novelty mining in English and Chinese when
given a series of novelty score thresholds.
From Figure 6 and Figure 7, we observe that
the performance on detecting novel Chinese docu-
ments is slightly lower than that on English. This
may be due to the different linguistical characteris-

tics of each language so that the preprocessing in-
fluence on each language’s novelty mining is dis-
similar. Furthermore, the Chinese preprocessing
quality is not as good as that on English so that it
is difficult to obtain a good “bag of words” from
a document. Moreover, the errors in word seg-
mentation will influence the result of POS tagging.
These issues make tokenizing and POS tagging
extremely difficult for the Chinese text.
However, the performance of Chinese sentence-
level novelty mining is almost the same as that on
English. The reason is that the novelty mining per-
formance at the sentence level is not so sensitive
to the preprocessing steps as that at the document
level. If the similarity computation is based on the
sentence level, the word segmentation and POS
tagging errors actually will not have a big influ-
ence on the result as that on documents.
6 Conclusion
This paper studied the preprocessing issues on
mining novel Chinese text, which, to the best
of our knowledge, have not been sufficiently
addressed in previous studies. We described
the Chinese preprocessing steps and discussed
the influence when choosing different Part-of-
Speech (POS) filtering rules. Then we applied
novelty mining on Chinese and English docu-
ments/sentences and compared their performance.
The experimental results on APWSJ and TREC
2004 Novelty Track showed that after adopting
a stricter POS filtering rule, the Chinese nov-
elty mining performed better on both documents
and sentences. This is because non-meaningful
words have a negative influence on detecting novel
text. However, compared to English, Chinese per-
formed worse on the document level and similarly
on the sentence level. The reason may be due to
the lower sensitivity of preprocessing at the sen-
tence level. The main contributions of this work
are as follows:
1) We investigated the preprocessing techniques
for detecting novel Chinese text on both doc-
ument and sentence level.
2) The POS filtering rule, telling how to select
words to represent one document/sentence,
was discussed.
3) Several experiments were conducted to com-
pare the novelty mining performance be-
tween Chinese and English. The novelty
mining performance on Chinese can be im-
proved as good as that on English if we can
increase the preprocessing precision on Chi-
nese text.
Our findings will be very helpful for develop-
ing a real-time Chinese novelty mining system at
both the document and sentence level. In future
work, we will try other word combinations and in-
vestigate better ways to represent the Chinese text.
In addition, we will explore how to utilize the bet-
ter Chinese sentence-level novelty mining result to
improve the detection performance on documents.
