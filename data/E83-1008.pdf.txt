ABSTRACT 
Finnish is a highly inflectional language. A 
verb can have over ten thousand different surface 
forms - nominals slightly fewer. Consequently, a 
morphological analyzer is an important component 
of a system aiming at "understanding" Finnish. 
This paper briefly describes our rule-based heu- 
ristic analyzer for Finnish nominal and verb 
forms. Our tests have shown it to be quite 
efficient: the analysis of a Finnish word in a 
running text takes an average of 15 ms of DEC 20 
CPU-time. 
I INTRODUCTION 
This paper briefly discusses the application 
of rule-based systems to the morphological analy- 
sis of Finnish word forms. Production systems seem 
to us a convenient way to express the strongly 
context-sensltive segmentation of Finnish word 
forms. This work demonstrates that they can be 
implemented to efficiently perform segmentations 
and uncover their interpretations. 
For any computational system aiming at 
interpreting a highly inflectional language, such 
as Finnish, the morphological analysis of word 
forms is an important component. Inflectional suf- 
fixes carry syntactic and semantic information 
which is necessary for a syntactic and logical 
analysis of a sentence. 
In contrast to major Indo-European languages, 
such as English, where morphological analysis is 
often so simple that reports of systems processing 
these languages usually omit morphological 
discussion, the analysis of Finnish word forms is 
a hard problem. 
A few algorithmic approaches, i.e. methods 
using precise and fully-informed decisions, to a 
morphological analysis of Finnish have been 
reported. Brodda and Karlsson (1981) attempted to 
find the most probable morphological segmentation 
for an arbitrary Finnish surface-word form without 
a reference to a lexicon. They report surprisingly 
high success, close to 90 %. However, their system 
neither transforms stems into a basic form, nor 
finds morphotactic interpretations. Karttunen et

al. (1981) report a LISP-program which searches in 
a root lexicon and in four segment tables for 
adjacent parts, which generate a given surface- 
word form. Koskenniami (1983) describes a rela- 
tional, symmetric model for analysis, as well as 
for production of Finnish word forms. He, too, 
uses a word-root lexicon and suffix lexicons to 
support comparisons between surface and lexical 
levels. 
Our morphological analyzer MORFIN was planned 
to constitute the first component in our forth- 
coming Finnish natural-language database query 
system. We therefore rate highly a computationally 
efficient method which supports an open lexicon. 
Lexical entries should carry the minimum of 
morphological information to allow a casual user 
to add new entries. 
We relaxed the requirement of fully informed 
decisions in favor of progressively generated and 
tested plausible heuristic hypotheses, dressed in 
production rules. The analysis of a word in our 
model represents a multi-level heuristic search. 
The basic control strategy of MORFIN resembles the 
one more extensively exploited in the Hearsay-II 
system (Erman et al.,1980). 
II FINNISH MORPHOTACTICS 
Finnish morphotactics is complex by any ordi- 
nary standard. Nouns, adjectives and verbs take 
numerous different forms to express case, number, 
possession, tense, mood, person and other morpheme 
categories. The problem of analysis is greatly 
aggravated by context sensitivity. A word stem may 
obtain different forms depending on the suffixes 
attached to it. Some morphemes have stem-dependent 
segments, and some segments are affected by other 
segments juxtaposed to it. 
Due to lack of space, we outline here only 
the structure of Finnish nominals. The surface 
form of a Finnish nominal ~ay be composed of the 
following constituents (parentheses denote 
optionality) : 
(I) root + ste~ending + number + case 
+ (possessive) + (clitic) 
The stem endings comprise a large collection 
of highly context-sensitive segments which link 
the word roots with the number and case suffixes 
in phonologically sound ways. The authorative Dic- 
tionary of Contemporary Finnish classifies nomi- 
49 
nals into 85 distinct paradigms based on the 
variation in their stem endings in the nominative, 
genetive, partitive, essive, and illative cases. 
The plural in a nominal is signaled by an 'i', 
'j', 't', or the null string (4) depending on the 
context. The fourteen cases used in Finnish are 
expressed by one or more suffix types each. 
Furthermore, consonant gradation may take place in 
the roots and stem endlngs with certain manifesta- 
tions of 'p', 't' or 'k'. 
As an example, consider the word 'pursi' 
(=yacht). The dictionary representation 'pu~ si 42' 
indicates the root 'put', . the stem ending 'si' in 
the nominative singular case, and the paradigm 
number 42. Among others, we have the inflections 
(2) pur + re + d + lla + mne + kin 
(=also on our yacht) 
put + s + i + lla + nme + ko 
(=on our yachts?) 
Consonant gradation takes place, for 
instance, in the word 'tak~ i 4' (=coat) as 
follows: 
(3) tak + i + ~ + ssa + ni (=in my coat) 
tak--k + e + i + hi + ni (=into my coats) 
III DESCRIPTION OF THE HEURISTIC METHOD 
A. Control Structure 
Our heuristic method uses the hypothesis-and- 
test paradigm used in many AI systems. A global 
database is divided into four distinct levels. 
Productions, which carry local heuristic 
knowledge, generate or confirm hypotheses between 
two levels as shown in the figure.

B. Morpheme Productions 
Morpheme productions recognize legal morpho- 
logical surface-segment configurations in a word, 
and slice and interprete the word accordingly. We 
use directly the allomorphic variants of the 
morphemes. Since possible segment configurations 
overlap, several mutually exclusive hypotheses are 
usually produced on the morphotactic level. All 
valid interpretations of a homographic word form 
are among them. 
The extracted rules were packed and compiled 
into a network of 33 distinct state-transition 
automata (3 for clitic, I for person, 6 for tense, 
3 for case, 2 for number, 5 for adjective com- 
paration, 3 for passive, 5 for participle, and 5 
for infinitive segments). These automata were 
generated by 204 morpheme productions of the form: 
(4) name: (2nd_context)(Ist context)segment --> 
POSTULATE-~int er pr etat i on, next ) 
'Segment' exhibits an allomorph; the optional 
'Ist' and '2nd contexts' indicate 0 to 2 left- 
contextual letters. The operation POSTULATE 
separates a recognized segment, attaches an 
interpretation to it, and proceeds to the indi- 
cated automata ('next'). For example, the produc- 
tion 
(5) LZ~n --> POSTULATE(\[gen,sg,...\], 
~TGMI, NUM2, PAR I, PAR4, PAR5, INF3, INF4, COMP4\] )
recognizes the substring 'n', if preceeded by a 
vowel, as an allomorph for the singular genetive 
case, separates 'n', and proceeds in parallel to 
two automatons for number, three for participles, 
two for infinitive, and one for comparation. 
C. Stem Productions 
Stem productions are case- and number- 
specific heuristic rules (genus-, mood- and tense- 
speslflc for verbs) postulating nominative singu- 
lar nouns as basic forms (Ist infinitive for 
verbs) which, under the postulated morphotactic 
interpretation, might have resulted in the 
observed stem form on the morphotactic level. They 
may reject a candidate stem-form as an impossible 
transformation, or produce one or more basic-form 
hypotheses. 
The Reverse Dictionary of Finnish lists close 
to 100 000 Finnish words sorted backwards. For 
each word the dictionary tags its syntactic 
category and the paradigm number. From that corpus 
we extracted heuristic information about equiva- 
lence classes of stem behavior. This knowledge we 
dressed into productions of the following form: 
(6) condition --> POSTULATE(cut,string,shift) 
If the condition of a production is 
satisfied, a basic-form hypothesis is postulated 
on the basic word-form level by cutting the 
recognized stem, adding a new string (separated by 
a blank to indicate the boundary between the root 
and the stem ending), and possibly shifting the 
blank. These operations are indicated by the argu- 
ments 'cut', 'string', and 'shift'. A well-formed 
condition (WFC) is defined recursively as follows. 
Any letter in the Finnish alphabet is a WFC, and 
such a condition is true if the last letter of a 
stem matches the letter. If &1 ,&2,-.. ,&n are WFCs, 
then the following constructions are also WFCs: 
(7) (1) &2&l 
(II) <&1 ,&2, • • • ,&n > 
50 
(I) is true if &1 and &2 are true, in that 
order, under the stipulation that the recognized 
letters in a stem are consomed. (II) is true if 
&1 or &2 or ... or &n is true. The testing in (II) 
proceeds from left to right and halts if recogni- 
tion occurs. The recognized letters are cons~ed. 
A capital letter can be used as a macro name for a 
WFC. For example, a genetive 'n'-specific produc- 
tion 
(8) <Ka,y>hde ~> POSTULATE(3,'ksi',0) 
('K' is an abbreviation for <d,f,g,h...> 
- the consonants) recognizes, among other stems, 
the genetive stem 'kahde' and generates the basic 
form hypothesis 'ka ksi' (: two). 
We collected 12 sets of productions for nomi- 
nal and 6 for verb stems. On average, a set has 
about 20 rules. These sets were compiled into 18 
efficient state-transition automata. 
We could also apply productions to consonant 
gradation. However, since a Finnish word can have 
at most two stems (weak and strong), MORFIN trades 
storage for computation and stores double stems in 
the lexicon. 
D. Dictionary Look-up 
The dictionary lock-up procedure confirms or 
rejects the baslc-word form hypotheses that have 
proliferated from the previous stages by matching 
them against the lexicon. Thus in MORFIN the only 
morphological information a dictionary entry 
carries is the boundary between the root and the 
stem ending in the basic-word form and grade. All 
other morphological knowledge is stored in MORFIN 
in an active form as rules. 
In MORFIN, input words are totally analyzed 
before a reference to the lexicon happens. Con- 
sequently, also words not existing in the lexicon 
are analyzed. This fact and the simple lexical 
form make it easy to add new words in the lexicon: 
a user simply chooses the right alternative(s) 
from postulated baslc-word form hypotheses. 
IV DISCUSSION 
MORFIN has been fully implemented in standard 
PASCAL and is in the final stages of testing. The 
lexicons contain nearly 2000 most frequent Finnish 
words. In addition to one lexicon for nominals, 
and one for verbs, MORFIN has two "front" lexicons 
for unvarying words, and words with slight 
variation (pronouns, adverbs etc. and those with 
exceptional forms). 
Currently MORFIN does not  analyze compound 
nouns into parts (as Karttunen et al. (1981) and 
Koskenniemi (1983) do). By modifying our system 
slightly we could do this by calling the system 
recursively. We rejected this kind of analysis 
because the semantics of many compounds must be 
stored as separate lexical entries in our database 
interface anyway. MORFIN does not 2roduce word 
• forms as the other two systems do. 
With respect to the goals we set, our tests 
rate MORFIN quite well (J~ppinen et al., 1983). 
Lexical entries are simple and their addition is 
easy. On average, only around 4 basic-word form 
hypotheses are produced on the basic-word form 
level. The analysis of a word in randomly selected 
newspaper texts takes about 15 ms of DEC 2060 CPU- 
time. Karttunen et al. (1981) report on their 
system that "It can analyze a short unambiguous 
word in less than 20 ms \[DEC-2060/Interlisp\] ... a 
long word or a compound ... can take ten times 
longer." Koskenniemi (1983) writes that "with a 
large lexicon it L1~is system\] takes about 0 .1CPU 
seconds EBurroughs B7800/PASCAL\] to analyze a 
reasonably complicated word form." 
Both Karttunen et al. (1981) and Koskenniemi 
(1983) proceed from left to right and compare an 
input word with forms generated from lexical 
entries. It is not clear how such models explain 
the phenomenon that a native speaker of Finnish 
spontaneously analyzes also granm~atical but 
meaningless word forms. Most Finns would probably 
agree that, for instance, 'vimpuloissa' is a 
plural inessive form of a meaningless word 
'vimpula'. How can a model based on comparison 
function when there is no lexical entry to be com- 
pared with? Our model encounters no problems with 
new or meaningless words. 'Vimpuloissa', if given 
as an input, would produce, among others, the 
hypothesis 'vimpul a' with correct interpretation. 
It would be rejected only because it is a non- 
existent Finnish word.
