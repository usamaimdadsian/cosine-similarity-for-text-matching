Abstract
While information status (IS) plays a cru-
cial role in discourse processing, there have
only been a handful of attempts to automat-
ically determine the IS of discourse entities.
We examine a related but more challenging
task, fine-grained IS determination, which
involves classifying a discourse entity as
one of 16 IS subtypes. We investigate the
use of rich knowledge sources for this task
in combination with a rule-based approach
and a learning-based approach. In experi-
ments with a set of Switchboard dialogues,
the learning-based approach achieves an ac-
curacy of 78.7%, outperforming the rule-
based approach by 21.3%.
1 Introduction
A linguistic notion central to discourse processing
is information status (IS). It describes the extent
to which a discourse entity, which is typically re-
ferred to by noun phrases (NPs) in a dialogue, is
available to the hearer. Different definitions of IS
have been proposed over the years. In this paper,
we adopt Nissim et al.’s (2004) proposal, since it
is primarily built upon Prince’s (1992) and Eck-
ert and Strube’s (2001) well-known definitions,
and is empirically shown by Nissim et al. to yield
an annotation scheme for IS in dialogue that has
good reproducibility.1
Specifically, Nissim et al. (2004) adopt a three-
way classification scheme for IS, defining a dis-
course entity as (1) old to the hearer if it is known
to the hearer and has previously been referred to in
the dialogue; (2) new if it is unknown to her and
1It is worth noting that several IS annotation schemes
have been proposed more recently. See Go¨tze et al. (2007)
and Riester et al. (2010) for details.
has not been previously referred to; and (3) me-
diated (henceforth med) if it is newly mentioned
in the dialogue but she can infer its identity from
a previously-mentioned entity. To capture finer-
grained distinctions for IS, Nissim et al. allow an
old or med entity to have a subtype, which subcat-
egorizes an old or med entity. For instance, a med
entity has the subtype set if the NP that refers to
it is in a set-subset relation with its antecedent.
IS plays a crucial role in discourse processing:
it provides an indication of how a discourse model
should be updated as a dialogue is processed in-
crementally. Its importance can be reflected in
part in the amount of attention it has received in
theoretical linguistics over the years (e.g., Halli-
day (1976), Prince (1981), Hajic?ova´ (1984), Vall-
duv?´ (1992), Steedman (2000)), and in part in the
benefits it can potentially bring to NLP applica-
tions. One task that could benefit from knowledge
of IS is identity coreference: since new entities by
definition have not been previously referred to, an
NP marked as new does not need to be resolved,
thereby improving the precision of a coreference
resolver. Knowledge of fine-grained or subcat-
egorized IS is valuable for other NLP tasks. For
instance, an NP marked as set signifies that it is in
a set-subset relation with its antecedent, thereby
providing important clues for bridging anaphora
resolution (e.g., Gasperin and Briscoe (2008)).
Despite the potential usefulness of IS in NLP
tasks, there has been little work on learning
the IS of discourse entities. To investigate the
plausibility of learning IS, Nissim et al. (2004)
annotate a set of Switchboard dialogues with
such information2 , and subsequently present a

board dialogues were later released by the LDC as part of the
NXT corpus, which is described in Calhoun et al. (2010).

rule-based approach and a learning-based ap-
proach to acquiring such knowledge (Nissim,
2006). More recently, we have improved Nissim’s
learning-based approach by augmenting her fea-
ture set, which comprises seven string-matching
and grammatical features, with lexical and syn-
tactic features (Rahman and Ng, 2011; hence-
forth R&N). Despite the improvements, the per-
formance on new entities remains poor: an F-
score of 46.5% was achieved.
Our goal in this paper is to investigate fine-
grained IS determination, the task of classifying
a discourse entity as one of the 16 IS subtypes
defined by Nissim et al. (2004).3 Owing in part
to the increase in the number of categories, fine-
grained IS determination is arguably a more chal-
lenging task than the 3-class IS determination task
that Nissim and R&N investigated. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first empirical investigation of au-
tomated fine-grained IS determination.
We propose a knowledge-rich approach to fine-
grained IS determination. Our proposal is moti-
vated in part by Nissim’s and R&N’s poor per-
formance on new entities, which we hypothesize
can be attributed to their sole reliance on shallow
knowledge sources. In light of this hypothesis,
our approach employs semantic and world knowl-
edge extracted from manually and automatically
constructed knowledge bases, as well as corefer-
ence information. The relevance of coreference to
IS determination can be seen from the definition
of IS: a new entity is not coreferential with any
previously-mentioned entity, whereas an old en-
tity may. While our use of coreference informa-
tion for IS determination and our earlier claim that
IS annotation would be useful for coreference res-
olution may seem to have created a chicken-and-
egg problem, they do not: since coreference reso-
lution and IS determination can benefit from each
other, it may be possible to formulate an approach
where the two tasks can mutually bootstrap.
We investigate rule-based and learning-based
approaches to fine-grained IS determination. In
the rule-based approach, we manually compose
rules to combine the aforementioned knowledge
sources. While we could employ the same knowl-
edge sources in the learning-based approach, we
chose to encode, among other knowledge sources,
3One of these 16 classes is the new type, for which no
subtype is defined. For ease of exposition, we will refer to
the new type as one of the 16 subtypes to be predicted.
the hand-written rules and their predictions di-
rectly as features for the learner. In an evalua-
tion on 147 Switchboard dialogues, our learning-
based approach to fine-grained IS determina-
tion achieves an accuracy of 78.7%, substan-
tially outperforming the rule-based approach by
21.3%. Equally importantly, when employing
these linguistically rich features to learn Nissim’s
3-class IS determination task, the resulting classi-
fier achieves an accuracy of 91.7%, surpassing the
classifier trained on R&N’s state-of-the-art fea-
ture set by 8.8% in absolute accuracy. Improve-
ments on the new class are particularly substan-
tial: its F-score rises from 46.7% to 87.2%.
2 IS Types and Subtypes: An Overview
In Nissim et al.’s (2004) IS classification scheme,
an NP can be assigned one of three main types
(old, med, new) and one of 16 subtypes. Below
we will illustrate their definitions with examples,
most of which are taken from Nissim (2003) or
Nissim et al.’s (2004) dataset (see Section 3).
Old. An NP is marked is old if (i) it is corefer-
ential with an entity introduced earlier, (ii) it is a
generic pronoun, or (iii) it is a personal pronoun
referring to the dialogue participants. Six sub-
types are defined for old entities: identity, event,
general, generic, ident generic, and relative. In
Example 1, my is marked as old with subtype
identity, since it is coreferent with I.
(1) I was angry that he destroyed my tent.
However, if the markable has a verb phrase (VP)
rather than an NP as its antecedent, it will be
marked as old/event, as can be seen in Example
2, where the antecedent of That is the VP put my
phone number on the form.
(2) They ask me to put my phone number
on the form. That I think is not needed.
Other NPs marked as old include (i) relative
pronouns, which have the subtype relative; (ii)
personal pronouns referring to the dialogue par-
ticipants, which have the subtype general, and
(iii) generic pronouns, which have the subtype
generic. The pronoun you in Example 3 is an in-
stance of a generic pronoun.
(3) I think to correct the judicial system,
you have to get the lawyer out of it.
Note, however, that in a coreference chain of
generic pronouns, every element of the chain is
799
assigned the subtype ident generic instead.
Mediated. An NP is marked as med if the en-
tity it refers to has not been previously introduced
in the dialogue, but can be inferred from already-
mentioned entities or is generally known to the
hearer. Nine subtypes are available for med en-
tities: general, bound, part, situation, event, set,
poss, func value, and aggregation.
General is assigned to med entities that are
generally known, such as the Earth, China, and
most proper names. Bound is reserved for bound
pronouns, an instance of which is shown in Ex-
ample 4, where its is bound to the variable of the
universally quantified NP, Every cat.
(4) Every cat ate its dinner.
Poss is assigned to NPs involved in intra-phrasal
possessive relations, including prenominal geni-
tives (i.e., X’s Y) and postnominal genitives (i.e.,
Y of X). Specifically, Y will be marked as poss if
X is old or med; otherwise, Y will be new. For ex-
ample, in cases like a friend’s boat where a friend
is new, boat is marked as new.
Four subtypes, namely part, situation, event,
and set, are used to identify instances of bridg-
ing (i.e., entities that are inferrable from a related
entity mentioned earlier in the dialogue). As an
example, consider the following sentences:
(5a) He passed by the door of Jan’s house
and saw that the door was painted red.
(5b) He passed by Jan’s house and saw that
the door was painted red.
In Example 5a, by the time the hearer processes
the second occurrence of the door, she has already
had a mental entity corresponding to the door (af-
ter processing the first occurrence). As a result,
the second occurrence of the door refers to an
old entity. In Example 5b, on the other hand, the
hearer is not assumed to have any mental repre-
sentation of the door in question, but she can in-
fer that the door she saw was part of Jan’s house.
Hence, this occurrence of the door should be
marked as med with subtype part, as it is involved
in a part-whole relation with its antecedent.
If an NP is involved in a set-subset relation with
its antecedent, it inherits the med subtype set.
This applies to the NP the house payment in Ex-
ample 6, whose antecedent is our monthly budget.
(6) What we try to do to stick to our
monthly budget is we pretty much have
the house payment.
If an NP is part of a situation set up by a
previously-mentioned entity, it is assigned the
subtype situation, as exemplified by the NP a few
horses in the sentence below, which is involved in
the situation set up by John’s ranch.
(7) Mary went to John’s ranch and saw that
there were only a few horses.
Similar to old entities, an NP marked as med may
be related to a previously mentioned VP. In this
case, the NP will receive the subtype event, as ex-
emplified by the NP the bus in the sentence below,
which is triggered by the VP traveling in Miami.
(8) We were traveling in Miami, and the
bus was very full.
If an NP refers to a value of a previously men-
tioned function, such as the NP 30 degrees in Ex-
ample 9, which is related to the temperature, then
it is assigned the subtype func value.
(9) The temperature rose to 30 degrees.
Finally, the subtype aggregation is assigned to co-
ordinated NPs if at least one of the NPs involved
is not new. However, if all NPs in the coordinated
phrase are new, the phrase should be marked as
new. For instance, the NP My son and I in Exam-
ple 10 should be marked as med/aggregation.
(10) I have a son ... My son and I like to
play chess after dinner.
New. An entity is new if it has not been intro-
duced in the dialogue and the hearer cannot infer
it from previously mentioned entities. No subtype
is defined for new entities.
There are cases where more than one IS value
is appropriate for a given NP. For instance, given
two occurrences of China in a dialogue, the sec-
ond occurrence can be labeled as old/identity (be-
cause it is coreferential with an earlier NP) or
med/general (because it is a generally known
entity). To break ties, Nissim (2003) define a
precedence relation on the IS subtypes, which
yields a total ordering on the subtypes. Since
all the old subtypes are ordered before their med
counterparts in this relation, the second occur-
rence of China in our example will be labeled as
old/identity. Owing to space limitations, we refer
the reader to Nissim (2003) for details.
3 Dataset
We employ Nissim et al.’s (2004) dataset, which
comprises 147 Switchboard dialogues. We parti-
800
tion them into a training set (117 dialogues) and a
test set (30 dialogues). A total of 58,835 NPs are
annotated with IS types and subtypes.4 The distri-
butions of NPs over the IS subtypes in the training
set and the test set are shown in Table 1.

4 Rule-Based Approach
In this section, we describe our rule-based ap-
proach to fine-grained IS determination, where we
manually design rules for assigning IS subtypes to
NPs based on the subtype definitions in Section 2,
Nissim’s (2003) IS annotation guidelines, and our
inspection of the IS annotations in the training
set. The motivations behind having a rule-based
approach are two-fold. First, it can serve as a
baseline for fine-grained IS determination. Sec-
ond, it can provide insight into how the available
knowledge sources can be combined into predic-
tion rules, which can potentially serve as “sophis-
ticated” features for a learning-based approach.
As shown in Table 2, our ruleset is composed of
18 rules, which should be applied to an NP in the
order in which they are listed. Rules 1–7 handle
the assignment of old subtypes to NPs. For in-
stance, Rule 1 identifies instances of old/general,
which comprises the personal pronouns referring
4Not all NPs have an IS type/subtype. For instance, a
pleonastic “it” does not refer to any real-world entity and
therefore does not have any IS, and so are nouns such as
“course” in “of course”, “accident” in “by accident”, etc.
to the dialogue participants. Note that this and
several other rules rely on coreference informa-
tion, which we obtain from two sources: (1)
chains generated automatically using the Stan-
ford Deterministic Coreference Resolution Sys-
tem (Lee et al., 2011)5, and (2) manually iden-
tified coreference chains taken directly from the
annotated Switchboard dialogues. Reporting re-
sults using these two ways of obtaining chains fa-
cilitates the comparison of the IS determination
results that we can realistically obtain using ex-
isting coreference technologies against those that
we could obtain if we further improved exist-
ing coreference resolvers. Note that both sources
provide identity coreference chains. Specifically,
the gold chains were annotated for NPs belong-
ing to old/identity and old/ident generic. Hence,
these chains can be used to distinguish between
old/general NPs and old/ident generic NPs, be-
cause the former are not part of a chain whereas
the latter are. However, they cannot be used
to distinguish between old/general entities and
old/generic entities, since neither of them belongs
to any chains. As a result, when gold chains are
used, Rule 1 will classify all occurrences of “you”
that are not part of a chain as old/general, regard-
less of whether the pronoun is generic. While the
gold chains alone can distinguish old/general and
old/ident generic NPs, the Stanford chains can-
not distinguish any of the old subtypes in the ab-
sence of other knowledge sources, since it gener-
ates chains for all old NPs regardless of their sub-
types. This implies that Rule 1 and several other
rules are only a very crude approximation of the
definition of the corresponding IS subtypes.
The rules for the remaining old subtypes can be
interpreted similarly. A few points deserve men-
tion. First, many rules depend on the string of
the NP under consideration (e.g., “they” in Rule 2
and “whatever” in Rule 4). The decision of which
strings are chosen is based primarily on our in-
spection of the training data. Hence, these rules
are partly data-driven. Second, these rules should
be applied in the order in which they are shown.
For instance, though not explicitly stated, Rule 3
is only applicable to the non-anaphoric “you” and
“they” pronouns, since Rule 2 has already covered
their anaphoric counterparts. Finally, Rule 7 uses
non-anaphoricity as a test of old/event NPs. The

1. if the NP is “I” or “you” and it is not part of a coreference chain, then

3. if the NP is “you” or “they”, then
subtype := old/generic
4. if the NP is “whatever” or an indefinite pronoun prefixed by “some” or “any” (e.g., “somebody”), then
subtype := old/generic
5. if the NP is an anaphoric pronoun other than “that”, or its string is identical to that of a preceding NP, then
subtype := old/ident
6. if the NP is “that” and it is coreferential with the immediately preceding word, then

“anything”, “one”, or “different”, or (2) has “another”, “anyone”, “other”, “such”, “that”, “of” or “type”
as neither its first nor last word, or (3) its head noun is also the head noun of a preceding NP, then
subtype := med/set

subtype := med/func value

ReVerb’s output, then
subtype := med/part
13. if the NP is of the form “X’s Y” or “poss-pro Y”, where X and Y are NPs and poss-pro is a possessive
pronoun, then
subtype := med/poss

reason is that these NPs have VP antecedents, but
both the gold chains and the Stanford chains are
computed over NPs only.
Rules 8–16 concern med subtypes. Apart from
Rule 8 (med/bound), Rule 9 (med/aggregation),
and Rule 11 (med/func value), which are arguably
crude approximations of the definitions of the
corresponding subtypes, the med rules are more
complicated than their old counterparts, in part
because of their reliance on the extraction of so-
phisticated knowledge. Below we describe the ex-
traction process and the motivation behind them.
Rule 10 concerns med/set. The words and
phrases listed in the rule, which are derived manu-
ally from the training data, provide suggestive ev-
idence that the NP under consideration is a subset
or a specific portion of an entity or concept men-
tioned earlier in the dialogue. Examples include
“another bedroom”, “different color”, “somebody
else”, “any place”, “one of them”, and “most other
cities”. Condition 3 of the rule, which checks
whether the head noun of the NP has been men-
tioned previously, is a good test for identity coref-
erence, but since all the old entities have suppos-
802
edly been identified by the preceding rules, it be-
comes a reasonable test for set-subset relations.
For convenience, we identify part-whole rela-
tions in Rule 12 based on the output produced by
ReVerb (Fader et al., 2011), an open information
extraction system.6 The output contains, among
other things, relation instances, each of which is
represented as a triple, <A,rel,B>, where rel is
a relation, and A and B are its arguments. To pre-
process the output, we first identify all the triples
that are instances of the part-whole relation us-
ing regular expressions. Next, we create clusters
of relation arguments, such that each pair of ar-
guments in a cluster has a part-whole relation.
This is easy: since part-whole is a transitive rela-
tion (i.e., <A,part,B> and <B,part,C> implies
<A,part,C>), we cluster the arguments by taking
the transitive closure of these relation instances.
Then, given an NP NPi in the test set, we assign
med/part to it if there is a preceding NP NPj such
that the two NPs are in the same argument cluster.
In Rule 14, we use FrameNet (Baker et al.,
1998) to determine whether med/situation should
be assigned to an NP, NPi. Specifically, we check
whether it fills an argument of a frame set up by
a preceding NP, NPj , or verb. To exemplify, let
us assume that NPj is “capital punishment”. We
search for “punishment” in FrameNet to access
the appropriate frame, which in this case is “re-
wards and punishments”. This frame contains a
list of arguments together with examples. If NPi is
one of these arguments, we assign med/situation
to NPi, since it is involved in a situation (described
by a frame) that is set up by a preceding NP/verb.
In Rule 15, we use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
to determine whether med/event should be as-
signed to an NP, NPi, by checking whether NPi is
related to an event, which is typically described
by a verb. Specifically, we use WordNet to check
whether there exists a verb, v, preceding NPi such
that v and NPi have the same hypernym. If so, we
assign NPi the subtype med/event. Note that we
ensure that the hypernym they share does not ap-
pear in the top five levels of the WordNet noun
and verb hierarchies, since we want them to be
related via a concept that is not overly general.
Rule 16 identifies instances of med/general.
The majority of its members are generally-known
6We use ReVerb ClueWeb09 Extractions 1.1, which
is available from http://reverb.cs.washington.
edu/reverb_clueweb_tuples-1.1.txt.gz.
entities, whose identification is difficult as it re-
quires world knowledge. Consequently, we apply
this rule only after all other med rules are applied.
As we can see, the rule assigns med/general to
NPs that are named entities (NEs) and definite de-
scriptions (specifically those NPs that start with
“the”). The reason is simple. Most NEs are gener-
ally known. Definite descriptions are typically not
new, so it seems reasonable to assign med/general
to them given that the remaining (i.e., unlabeled)
NPs are presumably either new and med/general.
Before Rule 18, which assigns an NP to the new
class by default, we have a “memorization” rule
that checks whether the NP under consideration
appears in the training set (Rule 17). If so, we
assign to it its most frequent subtype based on its
occurrences in the training set. In essence, this
heuristic rule can help classify some of the NPs
that are somehow “missed” by the first 16 rules.
The ordering of these rules has a direct impact
on performance of the ruleset, so a natural ques-
tion is: what criteria did we use to order the rules?
We order them in such a way that they respect the
total ordering on the subtypes imposed by Nis-
sim’s (2003) preference relation (see Section 3),
except that we give med/general a lower priority
than Nissim due to the difficulty involved in iden-
tifying generally known entities, as noted above.
5 Learning-Based Approach
In this section, we describe our learning-based ap-
proach to fine-grained IS determination. Since
we aim to automatically label an NP with its IS
subtype, we create one training/test instance from
each hand-annotated NP in the training/test set.
Each instance is represented using five types of
features, as described below.
Unigrams (119704). We create one binary fea-
ture for each unigram appearing in the training
set. Its value indicates the presence or absence
of the unigram in the NP under consideration.
Markables (209751). We create one binary fea-
ture for each markable (i.e., an NP having an IS
subtype) appearing in the training set. Its value is
1 if and only if the markable has the same string
as the NP under consideration.
Markable predictions (17). We create 17 bi-
nary features, 16 of which correspond to the 16
IS subtypes and the remaining one corresponds to
a “dummy subtype”. Specifically, if the NP un-
803
der consideration appears in the training set, we
use Rule 17 in our hand-crafted ruleset to deter-
mine the IS subtype it is most frequently associ-
ated with in the training set, and then set the value
of the feature corresponding to this IS subtype to
1. If the NP does not appear in the training set, we
set the value of the dummy subtype feature to 1.
Rule conditions (17). As mentioned before, we
can create features based on the hand-crafted rules
in Section 4. To describe these features, let us in-
troduce some notation. Let Rule i be denoted by
Ai ?? Bi, where Ai is the condition that must
be satisfied before the rule can be applied and Bi
is the IS subtype predicted by the rule. We could
create one binary feature from each Ai, and set its
value to 1 if Ai is satisfied by the NP under con-
sideration. These features, however, fail to cap-
ture a crucial aspect of the ruleset: the ordering of
the rules. For instance, Rule i should be applied
only if the conditions of the first i?1 rules are not
satisfied by the NP, but such ordering is not en-
coded in these features. To address this problem,
we capture rule ordering information by defining
binary feature fi as ¬A1?¬A2? . . .¬Ai?1?Ai,
where 1 ? i ? 16. In addition, we define a fea-
ture, f18, for the default rule (Rule 18) in a simi-
lar fashion, but since it does not have any condi-
tion, we simply define f18 as ¬A1 ? . . . ? ¬A16.
The value of a feature in this feature group is 1
if and only if the NP under consideration satis-
fies the condition defined by the feature. Note that
we did not create any features from Rule 17 here,
since we have already generated “markables” and
“markable prediction” features for it.
Rule predictions (17). None of the features fi’s
defined above makes use of the predictions of our
hand-crafted rules (i.e., the Bi’s). To make use
of these predictions, we define 17 binary features,
one for each Bi, where i = 1, . . . , 16, 18. Specif-
ically, the value of the feature corresponding to
Bi is 1 if and only if fi is 1, where fi is a “rule
condition” feature as defined above.
Since IS subtype determination is a 16-class
classification problem, we train a multi-class
SVM classifier on the training instances using
SVMmulticlass (Tsochantaridis et al., 2004), and
use it to make predictions on the test instances.7
7For all the experiments involving SVMmulticlass, we
set C, the regularization parameter, to 500,000, since pre-
liminary experiments indicate that preferring generalization
6 Evaluation
Next, we evaluate the rule-based approach and
the learning-based approach to determining the IS
subtype of each hand-annotated NP in the test set.
Classification results. Table 3 shows the results
of the two approaches. Specifically, row 1 shows
their accuracy, which is defined as the percent-
age of correctly classified instances. For each
approach, we present results that are generated
based on gold coreference chains as well as auto-
matic chains computed by the Stanford resolver.
As we can see, the rule-based approach
achieves accuracies of 66.0% (gold coreference)
and 57.4% (Stanford coreference), whereas the
learning-based approach achieves accuracies of
86.4% (gold) and 78.7% (Stanford). In other
words, the gold coreference results are better than
the Stanford coreference results, and the learning-
based results are better than the rule-based results.
While perhaps neither of these results are surpris-
ing, we are pleasantly surprised by the extent to
which the learned classifier outperforms the hand-
crafted rules: accuracies increase by 20.4% and
21.3% when gold coreference and Stanford coref-
erence are used, respectively. In other words, ma-
chine learning has “transformed” a ruleset that
achieves mediocre performance into a system that
achieves relatively high performance.
These results also suggest that coreference
plays a crucial role in IS subtype determination:
accuracies could increase by up to 7.7–8.6% if
we solely improved coreference resolution perfor-
mance. This is perhaps not surprising: IS and
coreference can mutually benefit from each other.
To gain additional insight into the task, we also
show in rows 2–17 of Table 3 the performance
on each of the 16 subtypes, expressed in terms of
recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F). A few
points deserve mention. First, in comparison to
the rule-based approach, the learning-based ap-
proach achieves considerably better performance
on almost all classes. One that is of particular in-
terest is the new class. As we can see in row 17,
its F-score rises by about 30 points. These gains
are accompanied by a simultaneous rise in recall
and precision. In particular, recall increases by
about 40 points. Now, recall from the introduc-
to overfitting (by setting C to a small value) tends to yield
poorer classification performance. The remaining learning
parameters are set to their default values.

tion that previous attempts on 3-class IS determi-
nation by Nissim and R&N have achieved poor
performance on the new class. We hypothesize
that the use of shallow features in their approaches
were responsible for the poor performance they
observed, and that using our knowledge-rich fea-
ture set could improve its performance. We will
test this hypothesis at the end of this section.
Other subtypes that are worth discussing
are med/aggregation, med/func value, and
med/poss. Recall that the rules we designed for
these classes were only crude approximations, or,
perhaps more precisely, simplified versions of the
definitions of the corresponding subtypes. For
instance, to determine whether an NP belongs to
med/aggregation, we simply look for occurrences
of “and” and “or” (Rule 9), whereas its definition
requires that not all of the NPs in the coordinated
phrase are new. Despite the over-simplicity
of these rules, machine learning has enabled
the available features to be combined in such a
way that high performance is achieved for these
classes (see rows 14–16).
Also worth examining are those classes for
which the hand-crafted rules rely on sophisti-
cated knowledge sources. They include med/part,
which relies on ReVerb; med/situation, which re-
lies on FrameNet; and med/event, which relies on
WordNet. As we can see from the rule-based re-
sults (rows 10–12), these knowledge sources have
yielded rules that achieved perfect precision but
low recall: 19.5% for part, 28.7% for situation,
and 10.5 for event. Nevertheless, the learning
algorithm has again discovered a profitable way
to combine the available features, enabling the F-
scores of these classes to increase by 35.1–50.6%.
While most classes are improved by machine
learning, the same is not true for old/event and
med/bound, whose F-scores are 4.5% (row 3) and
5.1% (row 9), respectively, when Stanford coref-
erence is employed. This is perhaps not surpris-
ing. Recall that the multi-class SVM classifier
was trained to maximize classification accuracy.
Hence, if it encounters a class that is both difficult
to learn and is under-represented, it may as well
aim to achieve good performance on the easier-
to-learn, well-represented classes at the expense
of these hard-to-learn, under-represented classes.
Feature analysis. In an attempt to gain addi-
tional insight into the performance contribution
of each of the five types of features used in the
learning-based approach, we conduct feature ab-
lation experiments. Results are shown in Table 4,
where each row shows the accuracy of the classi-
fier trained on all types of features except for the
one shown in that row. For easy reference, the
accuracy of the classifier trained on all types of
features is shown in row 1 of the table. According
to the paired t-test (p < 0.05), performance drops
significantly whichever feature type is removed.
This suggests that all five feature types are con-
tributing positively to overall accuracy. Also, the
markables features are the least important in the
presence of other feature groups, whereas mark-

able predictions and unigrams are the two most
important feature groups.
To get a better idea of the utility of each feature
type, we conduct another experiment in which we
train five classifiers, each of which employs ex-
actly one type of features. The accuracies of these
classifiers are shown in Table 5. As we can see,
the markables features have the smallest contribu-
tion, whereas unigrams have the largest contribu-
tion. Somewhat interesting are the results of the
classifiers trained on the rule conditions: the rules
are far more effective when gold coreference is
used. This can be attributed to the fact that the
design of the rules was based in part on the defini-
tions of the subtypes, which assume the availabil-
ity of perfect coreference information.
Knowledge source analysis. To gain some in-
sight into the extent to which a knowledge source
or a rule contributes to the overall performance of
the rule-based approach, we conduct ablation ex-
periments: in each experiment, we measure the
performance of the ruleset after removing a par-
ticular rule or knowledge source from it. Specifi-
cally, rows 2–4 of Table 6 show the accuracies of
the ruleset after removing the memorization rule
(Rule 17), the rule that uses ReVerb’s output (Rule
12), and the cue words used in Rules 4 and 10,
respectively. For easy reference, the accuracy of
the original ruleset is shown in row 1 of the ta-
ble. According to the paired t-test (p < 0.05),
performance drops significantly in all three abla-
tion experiments. This suggests that the memo-
rization rule, ReVerb, and the cue words all con-
tribute positively to the accuracy of the ruleset.

IS type results. We hypothesized earlier that
the poor performance reported by Nissim and
R&N on identifying new entities in their 3-class
IS classification experiments (i.e., classifying an
NP as old, med, or new) could be attributed to
their sole reliance on lexico-syntactic features. To
test this hypothesis, we (1) train a 3-class classi-
fier using the five types of features we employed
in our learning-based approach, computing the
features based on the Stanford coreference chains;
and (2) compare its results against those obtained
via the lexico-syntactic approach in R&N on our
test set. Results of these experiments, which are
shown in Table 7, substantiate our hypothesis:
when we replace R&N’s features with ours, accu-
racy rises from 82.9% to 91.7%. These gains can
be attributed to large improvements in identifying
new and med entities, for which F-scores increase
by about 40 points and 10 points, respectively.
7 Conclusions
We have examined the fine-grained IS determi-
nation task. Experiments on a set of Switch-
board dialogues show that our learning-based ap-
proach, which uses features that include hand-
crafted rules and their predictions, outperforms its
rule-based counterpart by more than 20%, achiev-
ing an overall accuracy of 78.7% when relying on
automatically computed coreference information.
In addition, we have achieved state-of-the-art re-
sults on the 3-class IS determination task, in part
due to our reliance on richer knowledge sources
in comparison to prior work. To our knowledge,
there has been little work on automatic IS subtype
determination. We hope that our work can stimu-
late further research on this task.
