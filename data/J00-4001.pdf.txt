The two main factors that characterize a text are its content and its style, and both can be used 
as a means of categorization. In this paper we present an approach to text categorization i
terms of genre and author for Modern Greek. In contrast o previous tylometric approaches, 
we attempt to take full advantage of existing natural language processing (NLP) tools. To this 
end, we propose aset of style markers including analysis-level measures that represent the way in 
which the input text has been analyzed and capture useful stylistic information without additional 
cost. We present aset of small-scale but reasonable experiments in text genre detection, author 
identification, and author verification tasks and show that the proposed method performs better 
than the most popular distributional lexical measures, i.e.,functions of vocabulary richness and 
frequencies of occurrence of the most frequent words. All the presented experiments are based on 
unrestricted text downloaded from the World Wide Web without any manual text preprocessing 
or text sampling. Various performance issues regarding the training set size and the significance of 
the proposed style markers are discussed. Our system can be used in any application that requires 
fast and easily adaptable text categorization i terms of stylistically homogeneous categories. 
Moreover, the procedure of defining analysis-level markers can be followed in order to extract 
useful stylistic information using existing text processing tools. 
1. Introduction 
The rapid expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW) in recent years has resulted 
in the creation of large volumes of text in electronic form. NLP applications uch as 
information retrieval and information extraction have been developed to treat this 
information automatically. Since the Internet is a very heterogeneous domain, these 
applications usually involve text categorization tasks with the following desiderata: 
• minimal computational cost, 
• ability to handle real-world (or unrestricted) text, and 
• either ease of adaptation to a certain domain or application or generality 
in order to cover a wide range of domains or applications.

The two main factors that characterize a text are its content and its style, both of 
which can be used for categorization purposes. Nevertheless, the literature on compu- 
tational stylistics is very limited in comparison to the work dealing with the proposi- 
tional content of the text. This is due to the lack of a formal definition of style as well 
as to the inability of current NLP systems to incorporate stylistic theories that require 
complicated information. In contrast o traditional stylistics based on formal linguistic 
theories, the use of statistical methods in style processing has proved to be a reliable 
approach (Biber 1995). According to the stylostatisticians, a given style is defined as a 
set of measurable patterns, called style markers. We adopt this definition in this study. 
Typical classificatory tasks in computational stylistics are the following: 
• Text genre detection concerns the identification of the kind (or functional 
style) of the text (Karlgren and Cutting 1994; Michos et al. 1996; Kessler, 
Nunberg, and Schi.itze 1997). 
• Authorship attribution concerns the identification of the author of the text 
(Holmes and Forsyth 1995; Baayen, Van Halteren, and Tweedie 1996; 
Tweedie, Singh, and Holmes 1996). 
These tasks have so far been considered completely separate problems. A typical text 
categorization system utilizing stylistic analysis (i.e., either text genre or authorship 
identification) is usually based on the following modules: 
. 
2. 
Extraction of style markers: A set of quantifiable measures are defined 
and a text-processing tool is usually developed, to automatically count 
them. 
Classification procedure: A disambiguation method (e.g., statistical, 
connectionist, etc.) is applied to classify the text in question into a 
predefined category (i.e., a text genre or an author). 
The most important computational pproaches to text genre detection have fo- 
cused on the use of simple measures that can be easily detected and reliably counted 
by a computational tool (Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch~itze 1997). To this end, various sets 
of style markers have been proposed (Karlgren and Cutting 1994), all of which are, in 
essence, subsets of the set used by Biber (1995), who ranked registers along seven di- 
mensions by applying factor analysis to a set of lexical and syntactic style markers that 
had been manually counted. In general, the current text genre detection approaches 
try to avoid using existing text processing tools rather than taking advantage of them. 
Authorship attribution studies have focused on the establishment of the authorship 
of anonymous or doubtful iterary texts, such as the Federalist Papers, 12 of which 
are of disputed authorship (Mosteller and Wallace 1984; Holmes and Forsyth 1995). 
Typical methodologies deal with a limited number of candidate authors using long 
text samples of several thousand words. Almost all the approaches to this task are 
based mainly on distributional lexical style markers. In a review paper of authorship 
attribution studies, Holmes (1994) claims: "yet, to date, no stylometrist has managed 
to establish a methodology which is better able to capture the style of a text than that 
based on lexical items" (p. 87). 
To the best of our knowledge, there is still no computational system that can 
distinguish the texts of a randomly chosen group of authors without requiring human 
assistance in the selection of both the most appropriate set of style markers and the 
most accurate disambiguation procedure.

Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis Text Categorization 
In this paper we describe an approach to text categorization i terms of genre and 
author based on a new stylometric method that utilizes already existing NLP tools. In 
addition to the style markers relevant o the actual output of the NLP tool (i.e., the 
analyzed text), we introduce analysis-level style markers, which represent the way in 
which the text has been analyzed by that tool. Such measures contain useful stylistic 
information and are easily available without additional computational cost. 
To illustrate, we apply the proposed technique to text categorization tasks for Mod- 
ern Greek corpora using an already existing sentence and chunk boundaries detector 
(SCBD) in unrestricted Modern Greek text (Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis 
2000). We present a set of small-scale but reasonable xperiments in text genre detec- 
tion, author identification, and author verification tasks and show that the performance 
of the proposed method is better in comparison with the most popular distributional 
lexical measures, i.e., functions of vocabulary richness and frequencies of occurrence 
of the most frequent words. Our approach is trainable and can be easily adapted to 
any set of stylistically homogeneous categories. 
We begin by discussing work relevant o text genre detection and authorship attri- 
bution focusing on the various types of style markers employed (Section 2). Next, we 
describe the proposed solution for extracting style markers using already existing NLP 
tools (Section 3) and apply our method to Modern Greek (Section 4), briefly describing 
the SCBD and proposing our set of style markers. The techniques used for automatic 
categorization of the stylistic vectors are discussed in Section 5. Section 6 deals with 
the application of our approach to text genre detection, and Section 7, with authorship 
attribution, for both author identification and author verification. In Sections 8 and 
9, we discuss important performance issues of the proposed methodology and the 
conclusions that can be drawn from this study. 
2. Current Trends in Stylometry 
The main feature that characterizes both text genre detection and authorship attri- 
bution studies is the selection of the most appropriate measures, namely, those that 
reflect the style of the writing. Various sets have been proposed in the literature. In 
this section, we classify the most popular of the proposed style markers, taking into 
account he information required for their calculation rather than the task they have 
been applied to. 
2.1 Token-Level Measures 
The simplest approach considers the sample text as a set of tokens grouped in sen- 
tences. Typical measures of this category are word count, sentence count, character per 
word count, and punctuation marks count. Such features have been widely used in 
both text genre detection and authorship attribution research since they can be easily 
detected and computed. It is worth noting that the first pioneering works in author- 
ship attribution, when no powerful computational systems were available, were based 
exclusively on these measures. For example, Morton (1965) used sentence length for 
testing the authorship of Greek prose, Brinegar (1963) adopted word length measures, 
and Brainerd's (1974) approach was based on distribution of syllables per word. Al- 
though such measures seemed to work in specific cases, they became subject o heavy 
criticism for their lack of generality (Smith 1983, 1985). 
2.2 Syntactic Annotation 
The use of measures related to syntactic annotation of the text is very common in text 
genre detection. Such measures provide very useful information for the exploration 
473 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
of the characteristics of style (Biber 1995). Typical paradigms are passive count, nom- 
inalization count, and counts of the frequency of various syntactic ategories (e.g., 
part-of-speech tags). Recently, syntactic information has also been applied to author- 
ship attribution. Specifically, Baayen, Van Halteren, and Tweedie (1996) used frequen- 
cies of occurrence of rewrite rules as they appear in a syntactically annotated corpus 
and proved that they perform better than word frequencies. Their calculation requires 
tagged or parsed text, however. Current NLP tools are not able to provide accurate 
calculation results for many of the previously proposed style markers. In the study of 
register variation conducted by Biber (1995), a subset of the measures (i.e., the simplest 
ones) was calculated by computational tools and the remaining were counted manu- 
ally. Additionally, the automatically acquired measures were counterchecked manually. 
Many researchers, therefore, try to avoid the use of features related to syntactic an- 
notation in order to avoid such problems (Kessler, Nunberg, and Sch~itze 1997). As 
a result, the recent advances in computational linguistics have not notably affected 
research in computational stylistics. 
2.3 Vocabulary Richness 
Various measures have been proposed for capturing the richness or the diversity of 
the vocabulary of a text and they have been applied mainly to authorship attribution 
studies. The most typical measure of this category is the type-token ratio V/N, where 
V is the size of the vocabulary of the sample text, and N is the number of tokens of 
the sample text. Similar features are the hapax legomena (i.e., words occurring once 
in the sample text) and the dislegomena (i.e., words occurring twice in the sample 
text). Since text length dramatically affects these features, many researchers have pro- 
posed functions of these features that they claim are text length independent (Honor6 
1979; Yule 1944; Sichel 1975). Additionally, instead of using a single measure, some 
researchers have used a set of such vocabulary richness functions in combination with 
multivariate statistical techniques to achieve better results in authorship attribution 
(Holmes 1992). In general, these measures are not computationally expensive. How- 
ever, according to results of recent studies, the majority of the vocabulary richness 
functions are highly text length dependent and quite unstable for texts shorter than 
1,000 words (Tweedie and Baayen 1998). 
2.4 Common Word Frequencies 
Instead of using vocabulary distribution measures, ome researchers have counted the 
frequency of occurrence of individual words in the sample text. Such counts are a reli- 
able discriminating factor (Karlgreen and Cutting 1994; Kessler, Nunberg, and Schi~tze 
1997) and have been applied to many works in text genre detection. Their calculation is
simple, but nontrivial effort is required for the selection of the most appropriate words 
for a given problem. Morever, the words that best distinguish a given group of authors 
cannot be applied to a different group of authors with the same success (Holmes and 
Forsyth 1995). Oakman (1980) notes: "The lesson seems clear not only for function 
words but for authorship word studies in general: particular words may work for 
specific cases uch as 'The Federalist Papers' but cannot be counted on for other anal- 
yses" (p. 28). Furthermore, the results of such studies are highly language dependent. 
Michos et al. (1996) introduce the idea of grouping certain words in categories, uch as 
idiomatic expressions, cientific terminology, formal words, and so on. Although this 
solution is language independent, i  requires the construction of a complicated com- 
putational mechanism for the automated detection of the categories in the sample text. 
Alternatively, the use of sets of common high-frequency words (typically 30 or 
50 words) has been applied mainly to authorship attribution studies (Burrows 1987).

The proposed method. 
The application of a principal components analysis on the frequencies of occurrence 
of the most frequent words achieved remarkable results in plotting the texts in the 
space of the first two principal components, for a wide variety of authors (Burrows 
1992). This approach is language independent and computationally inexpensive. Vari- 
ous additional restrictions to this basic method have been proposed (e.g., separation of 
common homographic forms, removal of proper names from the most frequent word 
list, etc.), aimed at improving its performance. For a fully automated system, such 
restrictions require robust and accurate NLP tools. 
3. The Proposed Method 
Our method attempts to exploit already existing NLP tools for the extraction of stylistic 
information. To this end, we use two types of measures, as can be seen in Figure 1: 
• measures relevant o the actual output of the NLP tool (i.e., usually 
tagged or parsed text), and 
• measures relevant o the particular methodology by which the NLP tool 
analyzes the text (analysis-level measures). 
Thus, the set of style markers is adapted to a specific, already existing NLP tool, 
taking into account its particular properties. Analysis-level measures capture useful 
stylistic information without additional cost. The NLP tool is not considered a black 
box. Therefore, full access to its source code is required in order to define and measure 
analysis-level style markers. Moreover, tool-specific knowledge, rather than language- 
specific knowledge, is required for the definition of such measures. In other words, 
researchers using this approach can define analysis-level measures based on their deep 
understanding of a particular NLP tool even if they are not familiar with the natural 
language to which the methodology is to be applied. 
To illustrate the proposed method, we apply it to Modern Greek using the SCBD, 
an existing NLP tool able to detect sentence and chunk boundaries in unrestricted text, 
as described in the next section. In addition to a set of easily computable f atures (i.e., 
token-level and syntax-level measures) provided by the actual output of the SCBD, 
475 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
we use a set of analysis-level features, i.e., measures that represent the way in which 
the input text has been analyzed by the SCBD. 
The particular analysis-level style markers can be calculated only when this specific 
computational tool is utilized. However, the SCBD is a general-purpose tool and was 
not designed for providing stylistic information exclusively. Thus, any NLP tool (e.g., 
part-of-speech taggers, parsers, etc.) can provide similar measures. The appropriate 
analysis-level style markers have to be defined according to the methodology used by 
the tool in order to analyze the text. For example, some similar measures have been 
used in stylistic experiments in information retrieval on the basis of a robust parser 
built for information retrieval purposes (Strzalkowski 1994). This parser produces trees 
to represent the structure of the sentences that compose the text. However, it is set 
to "skip" or surrender attempts to parse clauses after reaching a time-out hreshold. 
When the parser skips, it notes that in the parse tree. The measures proposed by 
Karlgren (1999) as indicators of clausal complexity are the average parse tree depth 
and the number of parser skips per sentence, which in essence are analysis-level style 
markers. 
4. Style Markers for Modem Greek 
As mentioned above, the subset of style markers used for Modern Greek depends on 
the text analysis by the specific NLP tool, the SCBD. Thus, before describing the set 
of style markers we used, we briefly present he main features of the SCBD. 
4.1 Description of the SCBD 
The SCBD is a text-processing tool able to deal with unrestricted Modern Greek text. 
No manual preprocessing is required. It performs the following procedures: 
Sentence boundary detection: The following punctuation marks are 
considered potential sentence boundaries: period, exclamation point, 
question mark, and ellipsis. A set of automatically acquired 
disambiguation rules (Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis 1999) is 
applied to every potential sentence boundary in order to locate the 
actual sentence boundaries. These rules utilize neither lexicons with 
specialized information or abbreviation lists. 
Chunk boundary detection: Intrasentential phrase detection is achieved 
through multiple-pass parsing making use of an approximately 
450-keyword lexicon (i.e., closed-class words such as articles and 
prepositions) and a 300-suffix lexicon containing the most common 
suffixes of Modern Greek words. Initially, using the suffix lexicon, a set 
of morphological descriptions i assigned to any word of the sentence 
not included in the keyword lexicon. If the suffix of a word does not 
match any of the entries of the suffix lexicon, then no morphological 
description is assigned to this word. It is marked as a special word and 
is not ignored in subsequent analysis. Then, each parsing pass (five 
passes are performed) analyzes a part of the sentence, based on the 
results of the previous passes, and the remaining part is kept for the 
subsequent passes. In general, the first passes try to detect simple cases 
that are easily recognizable, while the last passes deal with more 
complicated ones. Cases that are not covered by the disambiguation 
rules remain unanalyzed. The detected chunks are noun phrases (NPs),

prepositional phrases (PPs), verb phrases (VPs), and adverbial phrases 
(APs). In addition, two chunks are usually connected by a sequence of 
conjunctions (CONs). 
The SCBD is able to cope rapidly with any piece of text, even ill-formed text, and 
its performance is comparable to more sophisticated systems that require more com- 
plicated resources. Figure 2 gives an overview of the SCBD. An example of its output 
for a sample text, together with a rough English translation (included in parentheses), 
is given below (note that special words, those that do not match with any of the stored 
suffixes, are marked with an asterisk): 
VP\[&eu 0gAco uoz pg{oo (I don't want to pour)\] NP\[A&& (oil)\] PP\[crrr/9~wr~& (in the 
fire)\] CON\[of&kale (but)\] VP\[rr~¢re4a; (I believe)\] CON\[drL (that)\] NP\[r/

lately)\] VP\[rrponc~&cburc~¢ (causing)\] NP\[rr/(Sva~op&~ r~\]g ~oLu~¢ 7v,&#r/~ (the 
discontent of the public opinion)\]. 
It is worth noting that we did not modify the structure of the SCBD in order to 
calculate style markers, aside from adding simple functions for their measurement. 
4.2 Stylometric Levels 
Our aim during the definition of the set of style markers was to take full advantage 
of the analysis of the text by the SCBD. To this end, we included measures relevant to 
the actual output of this tool as well as measures relevant to the methodology used by 
the SCBD to analyze the text. Specifically, the proposed set of style markers comprises 
three levels: 
• Token Level: The sample text is considered as a set of tokens grouped in 
sentences. This level is based on the output of the sentence boundary

words remaining unanalyzed after pass 4/words 
words remaining unanalyzed after pass 5/words 
It is clear that the analysis level contains extremely useful stylistic information. For 
example, M14 and M15 are valuable markers that indicate of the percentage of high- 
frequency words and the percentage of unusual words included in the sample text, 
respectively. M16 is a useful indicator of the morphological ambiguity of the words 
and M17 indicates the degree to which this ambiguity has been resolved. Moreover, 
markers M18 to M22 indicate the syntactic omplexity of the text. Since the first parsing 
passes analyze the most common cases, it is easy to understand that a large part of 
a syntactically complicated text would not be analyzed by them (e.g., high values for 
M18, M19, and M20 in conjunction with low values for M21 and M22). Similarly, a 
syntactically simple text would be characterized by low values for M18, M19, and M20.

478 
Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis Text Categorization 
Note that all the proposed style markers are produced as ratios of two relative 
measures in order for them to be stable over the text length. However, they are not 
standardized. 
5. Text Categorization 
The methodology described in the previous ection provides a vector of 22 variables 
for each text. For automatically classifying this vector into one group (either genre or 
author) various techniques are available, which stem from multivariate statistics (e.g., 
discriminant analysis), neural networks, and machine learning (e.g., decision trees). 
Recently, Yang (1999) studied the performance of several classifiers on text categoriza- 
tion tasks and concluded that all the tested methods perform comparably when the 
training set comprises over 300 instances per category. On the other hand, when the 
number of positive training instances per category is small (less than 10) a regression- 
like method called linear least-squares fit and k-nearest neighbors outperform neural 
networks and naive Bayes classifiers (Yang and Liu 1999). 
In the present paper we used two well-known techniques of multivariate statistics: 
multiple regression and discriminant analysis. The response of these techniques i very 
fast since they are based on the calculation of simple linear functions. Moreover, their 
training procedures do not require excessive time or computational cost. Thus, they 
can be easily incorporated into a real-time application. 
5.1 Multiple Regression 
Multiple regression predicts values of a group of response (dependent) variables from 
a collection of predictor (independent) variable values (Edwards 1979). The response 
is expressed as a linear combination of the predictor variables, namely: 
yi = bo + z~bli + z2b2i  + • " q- zrbri q- ei 
where yi is the response for the ith category (i.e., text genre), Zl, z2,... , Zr are the pre- 
dictor variables (i.e., in our case r = 22), b0, bli, b2i . . . . .  bri, are the unknown coefficients 
calculated uring the training procedure, and ei is the random error. An indication of 
the goodness of fit of the model is provided by the coefficient of determination, R 2, 
defined as follows: 
n 
R2 _ j= l  
y/ 
E (yj - 9) 
j= l  
where n is the total amount of the training data (texts), 9 is the mean response, and 
finally, ~j and yj are the estimated response and the training response value, respec- 
tively. R 2 equals 1 if the fitted equation passes through all the data points, and, at the 
other extreme, equals 0. 
Moreover, multiple regression can also be used for the estimation of the signifi- 
cance of the independent variables. In particular, the amount by which R 2 is reduced if 
a certain independent variable is deleted from the regression equation (in other words, 
the contribution of the independent variable to R 2) is represented by the squared semi- 
partial correlation sri 2 (Tabachnick and Fidell 1996): 
sr~ = t~ (1 - a 2) 
df ~¢s 
479 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
where ti is the value of the t statistic for the ith variable and dffr¢~ are the residual 
degrees of freedom. Thus, the contribution of an independent variable to R 2 can be 
expressed as a function of the absolute value of t. The absolute t value of the jth 
estimated regression coefficient bj is calculated as follows: 
bj 
tbj = S--~ 
where Sb i is the standard error. The greater the t value, the more important the con- 
tribution of the independent variable (i.e., style marker) to the response value. 
5.2 Discriminant Analysis 
The mathematical objective of discriminant analysis is to weight and linearly com- 
bine the discriminating variables in some way so that the groups are forced to be as 
statistically distinct as possible (Eisenbeis and Avery 1972). The optimal discriminant 
function, therefore, is assumed to be a linear function of the variables and is deter- 
mined by maximizing the between-group variance while minimizing the within-group 
variance using a training sample. 
Discriminant analysis can be used for predicting the group membership of pre- 
viously unseen cases (i.e., test data) based on Mahalonobis distance (i.e., a measure 
of distance between two points in the space defined by multiple correlated variables). 
Initially, for each group, the location of the centroids, i.e., the points that represent 
the means for all variables in the multivariate space defined by the independent vari- 
ables, is determined. Then, for each case the Mahalanobis distances from each of the 
group centroids are computed and the case is classified into the closest group. The 
Mahalanobis distance d of a vector x from a mean vector mx is given by the formula: 
d 2 = (x  - mx)'C~-l(x - mx)  
where Cx is the covariance matrix of x. Using this classification method we can also 
derive the probability that a case belongs to a particular group (i.e., posterior proba- 
bilities), which is roughly proportional to the Mahalanobis distance from that group 
centroid. Discriminant analysis has been employed by researchers in automatic text 
genre detection (Biber 1993b; Karlgren and Cutting 1994) since it offers a simple and 
robust solution despite the fact that it presupposes normal distributions of the dis- 
criminating variables. 
6. Text Genre Detection 
6.1 Genre-based Corpus 
Since no Modern Greek corpus covering a wide range of text genres was available, 
we decided to compose one from scratch. The corpus used in experiments in Michos 
et al. (1996) includes a limited number of carefully selected and manually edited texts 
divided into generic categories (e.g., journalistic, scientific, etc.). In general, the use 
of already existing corpora not built for text genre detection (e.g., the Brown corpus) 
raises several problems ince such categories may not be stylistically homogeneous 
(Kessler, Nunberg, and Schiitze 1997). The corpus used in our study contains texts 
that meet the following criteria: 
• Real-world text: The texts have to be already in electronic form and thus 
may be ill-formed.

• Raw text: Neither manually inserted tags nor other manual 
text-preprocessing restrictions are set. 
• Whole text: Neither text length limitations nor other manual 
text-sampling restrictions are set. In other words, a text has to be 
available as it appears in its source. 
We constructed a corpus by downloading texts from various WWW sites edited 
in Modern Greek, trying to cover as many genres as possible. This corpus is shown 
in Table 1. Although the complete set of text genres may differ significantly among 
two languages (Biber 1995), they usually overlap to a great extent, especially for Indo- 
European languages. The set we propose, therefore, can be compared to the ones used 
in similar studies of English (Karlgren and Cutting 1994; Biber 1995). Additionally, 
no manual preprocessing was performed aside from removing unnecessary headings 
irrelevant to the text itself. 
It must also be pointed out that the last three text genres (i.e., G08, G09, and 
G10) refer to spoken language that has been transcribed either before (i.e., planned 
speeches, broadcast news) or after (i.e., interviews) it has been uttered. On the other 
hand, G01 to G07 refer to written language. 
The genre-based corpus was divided into a training part and a test part of equal 
size. Ten texts per genre were included in the training corpus and ten texts per genre 
were included in the test corpus. The remaining five texts per genre were used only 
in the experiments described in Section 7. 
6.2 Setting the Baseline 
To evaluate the proposed approach, we decided to apply two previous tylometric ap- 
proaches that are based on distributional lexical measures to the same testing round: 
(i) a multivariate model of functions of vocabulary richness (Holmes 1992) and (ii) the 
frequencies ofoccurrence of the most frequent words (Burrows 1992). These two meth- 
ods were selected since they are language independent and computationally inexpen- 
sive. 
To measure the richness of the vocabulary, we used a set of five functions, namely, 
K proposed by Yule (1944), R proposed by Honor6 (1979), W proposed by Brunet 
(1978), S proposed by Sichel (1975), and D proposed by Simpson (1949), which are

D = Z.-, 'NTlqL-i'~

where Vi is the number of words used exactly i times (see Section 2.3 for the defini- 
tion of V and N) and o~ is a parameter usually fixed at 0.17. The same set of func- 
tions has been used by Baayen and his colleagues for similar purposes (Baayen, Van 
Halteren, and Tweedie 1996). For every text, these functions are calculated and a vec- 
tor of five parameters i produced. These vectors can then be classified to the most 
likely genre by applying one of the classification techniques discussed in the previ- 
ous section. Hereafter, this approach will be called VR (which stands for vocabulary 
richness). 
The second method, which is lexically based, uses the frequencies of occurrence of 
the most frequent words of the training corpus as style markers. Typically, sets of 30 
or 50 most frequent words are used (Baayen, Van Halteren, and Tweedie 1996; Holmes 
and Forsyth 1995). For comparison purposes, we employed two sets of common words 
based on 30 and 50 most frequent words of the training corpus, respectively. Thus, 
for each text a vector of 30 (or 50) parameters indicating the frequencies of the most 
frequent words of the training corpus (normalized by the text length) are calculated. 
As above, these vectors can then be classified to the most likely genre. These two 
approaches will be called CWF-30 and CWF-50 for common word frequencies and the 
number of the high-frequency words. 
6.3 Results 
The entire corpus described in the previous ection was analyzed by the SCBD, which 
automatically provided avector of 22 parameters for each text. The vectors of the train- 
ing corpus were used in order to extract he classification model using both multiple 
regression and discriminant analysis. These classification models were then applied to 
the vectors of the test corpus for cross-validating their performance on unseen cases. 
The same training and test procedure was performed for the VR approach and for the 
CWF-30 and CWF-50 methods. 
Comparative results in terms of identification error (i.e., erroneously classified 
texts/total texts) are given in Figure 3. In general, discriminant analysis seems to be 
better able to distinguish the texts of the test corpus. The performance of the VR 
approach is quite poor. This is due to the limited text length of the majority of the 
texts of the genre-based corpus (Tweedie and Baayen 1998). Moreover, our approach 
is more accurate than the CWF-30 and the CWF-50. The identification error rate of 
our approach using both multiple regression and discriminant analysis is given in 
Table 2. Although the average rror rate is equal for the two methodologies, there are 
significant differences in the disambiguation accuracy of certain text genres (see G01 
and G05). In general, the error rate is more normally distributed using discriminant 
analysis. Moreover, approximately 60% of the identification errors using multiple re-

discriminant analysis were caused by G01, G05, and G07. On the other hand, G04, 
G06, G08, and G10 are stylistically homogeneous to a great extent in both cases. 
The complete identification results of our method using discriminant analysis are 
presented in a confusion matrix in Table 3. Each row represents a text genre being 
tested and the columns represent he classification results of the test texts of that 
particular genre. The main misclassifications are as follows: 
• press editorial ~ press reportage. Notice that the texts were taken from the 
same newspaper, which is published on a weekly basis. In many cases, 
therefore, the reportage documents review a whole week and present 
some comments by the author. 
• curricula vitae --~ official documents. Both are usually characterized by an 
abstract style. 
• literature ~ interviews and planned speeches. These two text genres of the 
spoken language usually involve narration.

Note that spoken language text genres (i.e., G08-G10) have a lower identification error 
rate, on average (0.10), than written language text genres (0.21) as calculated by either 
multiple regression or discriminant analysis. 
The classification accuracy of our method related to the text length for the text 
genre experiment using multiple regression is presented in Figure 4. Due to the stylistic 
homogeneity of recipes and broadcast news, the accuracy of texts shorter than 500 words 
(see Table 1) is relatively high. In addition, texts over 1,500 words seem to be classified 
more reliably. Note that according to Biber (1990, 1993a) a text length of 1,000 words 
is adequate for representing the distributions of many core linguistic features of a 
stylistic category.

7. Authorship Attribution 
7.1 Author-based Corpus 
In authorship attribution experiments we chose to deal with texts taken from news- 
papers, since a wide variety of authors frequently publish their writings in the press, 
making the collection of a considerable number of texts for several authors easier. In 
particular, the corpus used for this study comprises texts downloaded from the WWW 
site of the Modern Greek weekly newspaper TO BHMA,  (the tribune).2 The structure of 
this newspaper is shown in Table 4. We performed experiments based on two groups 
of authors, namely: 
. 
2. 
Group A: Ten randomly selected authors whose writings are frequently 
found in section A. This section comprises texts written mainly by 
journalists on a variety of current affairs. Moreover, a certain author may 
sign texts from different text genres (e.g., editorial, reportage, tc.). Note 
that in many cases such writings are highly edited to conform to a 
predefined style, thus washing out specific characteristics of the authors, 
which complicates the task of attributing authorship. 
Group B: Ten randomly selected authors whose writings are frequently 
found in section B. This supplement comprises essays on science, 
culture, history, and so on, in other words, writings in which the 
idiosyncratic style of the author is not overshadowed by functional 
objectives. In general, the texts included in the B section are written by 
scholars, rather than journalists. 
Analytical information on the author-based corpus is in Table 5. All the downloaded 
texts were taken from issues published uring 1998 in order to minimize the potential 
change of the personal style of an author over time. The last column of this table refers 
to the thematic area of the majority of the writings of each author. This information 
was not taken into account during the construction of the corpus. The author-based

corpus was divided into a training part and a test part of equal size (i.e., 10 texts per 
author for training and 10 texts per author for test). 
7.2 Author Identification 
As for the text genre detection experiment, the entire corpus was first analyzed auto- 
matically by the SCBD. We then used the stylistic vectors of the training corpus to train 
the classification model for each group separately, based on multiple regression and 
discriminant analysis. We cross-validated the acquired models by applying them to 
the test corpus of the corresponding group. The same procedure was followed based 
on the VR, CWF-30, and CWF-50 approaches. Comparative results in terms of the 
identification error rate for groups A and B are given in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. 
As in the case of text genre detection, the VR method achieved far lower accuracy 
results than the others. The performance of the CWF-30 and CWF-50 is significantly 
better in group B than in group A. In both groups, our approach achieved the best 
performance. 
The identification error rates of our approach using both multiple regression and 
discriminant analysis are presented in Table 6. For group A, there are significant dif- 
ferences in the accuracy of the two techniques. However, three authors (A01, A03, 
and A06) are responsible for approximately 50% of the average rror rate, probably 
because the average text length of these authors is relatively short, i.e., shorter than 
800 words (see Table 5). 
On the other hand, the two techniques give similar disambiguation results for 
group B. A considerable percentage of the average rror rate is caused by the authors 
B01, B05, and B08 (i.e., 65% for multiple regression, 55% for discriminant analysis). 
These authors also have a relatively short average text length, i.e., shorter than 1,000 
words.

Text length (in words) 
Text length related to accuracy for the author identification experiments. 
It seems, therefore, that text length is a crucial factor in identifying the stylistic 
features that characterize a certain author. Classification accuracy for both groups us- 
ing multiple regression related to text length is presented in more detail in Figure 7. 
Approximately 80% (i.e., 53 out of 65) of the total erroneously classified texts are 
shorter than 1,000 words. Moreover, the accuracy results for the two groups are com- 
parable. In fact, the best results have been achieved under discriminant analysis for 
group A. This fact verifies that the proposed set of style markers is capable of captur- 
ing the underlying stylistic features that characterize the author of a text even when 
dealing with texts taken from various text genres. Note that CWF-30 and CWF-50 
failed to achieve comparable performance for groups A and B. 
7.3 Author Verification 
Instead of trying to select he most likely author of a given text from among a given 
group of authors (i.e., the author identification problem), many applications require 
the confirmation (or rejection) of the hypothesis that a given person is the author of the 
text (i.e., the author verification problem). In such cases, the classification procedure 
is less complicated since there are only two possible answers: yes, i.e., the author in 
question is indeed the person who wrote the text, or no, i.e., the text was not written 
by this person. 
Implementing an automatic author verification system requires: 
The development of a response function for a given author. For a given 
text, this function must provide a response value based on the vector of 
the style markers of the text. 
The definition of a threshold value. Any text whose response value is 
greater than that of the threshold is accepted as written by the author in 
question. Otherwise, it is rejected.

FR, FA, and mean error for group A related to threshold values expressed as subdivisions of R. 
Additionally, for measuring the accuracy of the author verification method for 
a given author, False Rejection (FR) and False Acceptance (FA) can be used. These 
measures are commonly used in the area of speaker verification in speech processing 
(Fakotakis, Tsopanoglou, and Kokkinakis 1993) and are defined as follows: 
FR = rejected texts of the author~total texts of the author 
FA = accepted texts of other authors~total texts of other authors 
In our study, we used the response functions taken from the application of multiple 
regression to group A and group B, as described in the previous ection. The selection 
of a threshold value, on the other hand, is highly dependent on the application. Some 
applications require either minimal FR or minimal FA, while others require minimal 
mean error, i.e., (FR + FA)/2. 
We chose to express the threshold value as a function of the multiple correlation 
coefficient R = +v~ of the regression functions (see Section 5.1) since it measures 
the degree to which the regression function fits the training data. It equals 1 if the 
fitted equation passes through all the data points and at the other extreme, equals 0, 
as already mentioned for R 2. Figures 8 and 9 depict he variation of the average FR, 
FA, and the mean error values for the test corpus of group A and group B, respectively, 
using various subdivisions of R as threshold. Notice that the evaluation shown used 
texts within the same group of authors for testing (i.e., closed-set evaluation). Low 
threshold values correspond to minimal FR, while high threshold values correspond 
to minimal FA. The minimal mean error corresponds tothreshold values between 0.4R 
and 0.5R for both groups. The FR and FA values for group A and group B using 0.5R 
as threshold are given in Table 7. The greatest part of the total FR in both groups 
accounts for the authors characterized by short text length (i.e., group A: A01, A03, 
and A06, group B: B01, B05, and B08) as in the case of author identification. On the 
other hand, FA seems to be highly relevant o the threshold value. The smaller the 
threshold value, the greater the false acceptance.

8. Performance Issues 
8.1 Training Set Size 
Our study makes use of 10 training texts from each category (i.e., either a text genre or 
an author) in order to extract he appropriate coefficients. This assessment meets the 
criteria of a system that requires easy adaptation of the text categorization methodol-  
ogy to a certain domain. Biber (1990, 1993a) claims that it is possible to represent the 
distributions of many core linguistic features of a stylistic category based on relatively 
few texts from each category (as few as 10 texts), but we were interested in exploring 
the way in which the identification error rate is affected by increasing the training 
data. To this end, we performed experiments on text genre detection using multiple 
regression based on variable training data. Specifically, we varied the training corpus, 
including 7 to 15 texts for each genre, but used the same test corpus of 10 texts for 
all of the experiments. The same procedure was followed for the lexically based ap- 
proaches VR, CWF-30, and CWF-50. Comparat ive results of the average identification 
error rate related to the training set size are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 
The identification error rate of the text genre detection experiment related to the training set 
size. 
The performance of VR is not significantly affected by increasing the training set 
size. On the other hand, the identification error rate of CWF-30, CWF-50, and that of 
our approach is generally reduced by increasing the number of texts used for training. 
The performance of CWF-30 is more stable as compared to CWF-50 but is lower than 
that of our set of style markers. 
The best results are achieved by our approach using 14 training texts per genre 
(i.e., only 15 out of 100 texts misclassified). However, the identification error rate does 
not continuously decrease from 11 to 15 training texts; the identification error rate 
using 12 as well as 15 training texts for each category is greater than the rate attained 
by using 10 texts. Thus, it is clear that satisfactory accuracy can be achieved with only

8.2 Significance of Style Markers 
The proposed set of style markers is divided into three levels--token level, syntax level, 
and analysis level. It would be useful to calculate the contribution of each marker, and 
consequently of each level, to the classification procedure. To this end, we used the 
absolute t values of the linear regression functions that indicate the contribution of 
each independent variable to the response value (see Section 5.1). 
The average absolute t values of the 22 style markers, taking into account he 
regression functions for both text genre and author identification experiments, are 
presented in Table 8. In both cases, the most important stylometric level is the token 
level, while the syntax level contributes the least to the final response. On the other 
hand, M02, M12, and M15 are the most important style markers for text genre detection 
(i.e., average t > 1.50) while the token-level measures, M01, M02, and M03, are the 
most valuable measures for authorship attribution (for the specific groups of authors). 
8.3 Defective Computational Analysis 
The set of style markers is provided by the SCBD, an existing computational tool. To 
explore the degree to which the accuracy results are dependent on the accuracy of

the SCBD, we created an artificial defect in the output of the SCBD by corrupting the 
sentence and chunk boundary detection procedures. In particular: 
in the sentence boundary detection procedure, only periods were 
considered to denote a potential sentence boundary, and 
the fifth parsing pass was excluded from the chunk boundary detection 
procedure. 
These changes significantly decreased the accuracy of the output of the SCBD. 
We performed the text genre experiment again using multiple regression based on 
the defective data. The average identification error rate was increased approximately 
25% (i.e., new identification error = 0.23). As expected, the accuracy of the text cate- 
gorization methodology strongly depends on the accuracy of the SCBD. Note that the 
contribution of the stylometric levels to the final response has also changed. Table 9 
shows average absolute t values for both the regular and the defective computational 
analysis. Although the token-level measures are still the most important contributors 
to the response, the disproportion between them and both the analysis-level and the 
syntax-level measures has considerably decreased.

9. Conclusions 
In this paper we presented an approach to text categorization i terms of stylisti- 
cally homogeneous categories, either text genres or authors. The results of apply- 
ing this methodology to text genre detection and author identification and verifica- 
tion experiments are strongly encouraging; this methodology outperforms existing 
lexically based methods. Since the stylistic differences are clearer among text gen- 
res, the results achieved in text genre detection are considerably better than those 
of the authorship attribution tasks. However, in both cases, a limited number of 
text genres or authors are responsible for the greatest part of the identification er- 
ror rate. 
As seen in Figures 4 and 7, text length plays an important role, especially in 
the case of author identification. A lower boundary of 1,000 words for each text 
seems reasonable for assuring improved performance. Nevertheless, when dealing 
with real-world text, it is not always possible to reach this lower bound. The cor- 
pora used in all the experiments presented here consist of real-world texts down- 
loaded from the Internet without any manual text preprocessing or text sampling 
limitations. The majority of these texts have an average text length shorter than 1,000 
words. 
Our experiments have shown that our method can be applied to a randomly 
selected group of stylistically homogeneous categories without any manual adapta- 
tion restrictions. A training corpus consisting of 10 texts per category is adequate for 
achieving relatively high classification accuracy. We attempted to take advantage of 
existing NLP tools by using analysis-level style markers that provide useful stylistic 
information without any additional cost. In essence, such measures represent the way 
in which the text has been analyzed by the computational tool. We proved that these 
measures are more important to the final response than measures related to the actual 
output of the tool on the syntactic level (see Table 8). 
Much work remains to be done on the stylistic interpretation f the acquired results 
and the automatic extraction of stylistic onclusions related to both the text itself and its 
author. Such stylistic onclusions could explain the differences and similarities among 
various genres or authors on a formal basis. Moreover, the definition of a basic text 
length unit would open the way to the exploration of the variation of style within a 
single text. This procedure could assist in the detection of certain sections of the input 
text where the useful information is more likely to be found. We believe that such 
tasks can be performed using a set of style markers imilar to the one we proposed. 
Finally, the combination of our approach with lexically based methods, such as CWF- 
30, can result in a very reliable text categorization system in terms of stylistically 
homogeneous categories.
