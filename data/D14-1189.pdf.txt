Abstract
We propose a simple unsupervised ap-
proach to detecting non-compositional
components in multiword expressions
based on Wiktionary. The approach makes
use of the definitions, synonyms and trans-
lations in Wiktionary, and is applicable to
any type of MWE in any language, assum-
ing the MWE is contained in Wiktionary.
Our experiments show that the proposed
approach achieves higher F-score than
state-of-the-art methods.
1 Introduction
A multiword expression (MWE) is a combina-
tion of words with lexical, syntactic or seman-
tic idiosyncrasy (Sag et al., 2002; Baldwin and
Kim, 2009). An MWE is considered (semanti-
cally) “non-compositional” when its meaning is
not predictable from the meaning of its compo-
nents. Conversely, compositional MWEs are those
whose meaning is predictable from the meaning
of the components. Based on this definition, a
component is compositional within an MWE, if its
meaning is reflected in the meaning of the MWE,
and it is non-compositional otherwise.
Understanding which components are non-
compositional within an MWE is important in
NLP applications in which semantic information
is required. For example, when searching for
spelling bee, we may also be interested in docu-
ments about spelling, but not those which contain
only bee. For research project, on the other hand,
we are likely to be interested in documents which
contain either research or project in isolation, and
for swan song, we are only going to be interested
in documents which contain the phrase swan song,
and not just swan or song.
In this paper, we propose an unsupervised ap-
proach based on Wikitionary for predicting which
components of a given MWE have a composi-
tional usage. Experiments over two widely-used
datasets show that our approach outperforms state-
of-the-art methods.
2 Related Work
Previous studies which have considered MWE
compositionality have focused on either the iden-
tification of non-compositional MWE token in-
stances (Kim and Baldwin, 2007; Fazly et al.,
2009; Forthergill and Baldwin, 2011; Muzny and
Zettlemoyer, 2013), or the prediction of the com-
positionality of MWE types (Reddy et al., 2011;
Salehi and Cook, 2013; Salehi et al., 2014). The
identification of non-compositional MWE tokens
is an important task when a word combination
such as kick the bucket or saw logs is ambiguous
between a compositional (generally non-MWE)
and non-compositional MWE usage. Approaches
have ranged from the unsupervised learning of
type-level preferences (Fazly et al., 2009) to su-
pervised methods specific to particular MWE con-
structions (Kim and Baldwin, 2007) or applica-
ble across multiple constructions using features
similar to those used in all-words word sense
disambiguation (Forthergill and Baldwin, 2011;
Muzny and Zettlemoyer, 2013). The prediction
of the compositionality of MWE types has tradi-
tionally been couched as a binary classification
task (compositional or non-compositional: Bald-
win et al. (2003), Bannard (2006)), but more re-
cent work has moved towards a regression setup,
where the degree of the compositionality is pre-
dicted on a continuous scale (Reddy et al., 2011;
Salehi and Cook, 2013; Salehi et al., 2014). In ei-
ther case, the modelling has been done either over
the whole MWE (Reddy et al., 2011; Salehi and
Cook, 2013), or relative to each component within
the MWE (Baldwin et al., 2003; Bannard, 2006).
In this paper, we focus on the binary classification
of MWE types relative to each component of the
1792
MWE.
The work that is perhaps most closely related to
this paper is that of Salehi and Cook (2013) and
Salehi et al. (2014), who use translation data to
predict the compositionality of a given MWE rel-
ative to each of its components, and then combine
those scores to derive an overall compositionality
score. In both cases, translations of the MWE and
its components are sourced from PanLex (Bald-
win et al., 2010; Kamholz et al., 2014), and if
there is greater similarity between the translated
components and MWE in a range of languages,
the MWE is predicted to be more compositional.
The basis of the similarity calculation is unsuper-
vised, using either string similarity (Salehi and
Cook, 2013) or distributional similarity (Salehi et
al., 2014). However, the overall method is su-
pervised, as training data is used to select the
languages to aggregate scores across for a given
MWE construction. To benchmark our method,
we use two of the same datasets as these two pa-
pers, and repurpose the best-performing methods
of Salehi and Cook (2013) and Salehi et al. (2014)
for classification of the compositionality of each
MWE component.
3 Methodology
Our basic method relies on analysis of lexical
overlap between the component words and the def-
initions of the MWE in Wiktionary, in the man-
ner of Lesk (1986). That is, if a given component
can be found in the definition, then it is inferred
that the MWE carries the meaning of that compo-
nent. For example, the Wiktionary definition of
swimming pool is “An artificially constructed pool
of water used for swimming”, suggesting that the
MWE is compositional relative to both swimming
and pool. If the MWE is not found in Wiktionary,
we use Wikipedia as a backoff, and use the first
paragraph of the (top-ranked) Wikipedia article as
a proxy for the definition.
As detailed below, we further extend the basic
method to incorporate three types of information
found in Wiktionary: (1) definitions of each word
in the definitions, (2) synonyms of the words in the
definitions, and (3) translations of the MWEs and
components.
3.1 Definition-based Similarity
The basic method uses Boolean lexical overlap be-
tween the target component of the MWE and a
definition. A given MWE will often have multiple
definitions, however, begging the question of how
to combine across them, for which we propose the
following three methods.
First Definition (FIRSTDEF): Use only the
first-listed Wiktionary definition for the MWE,
based on the assumption that this is the predom-
inant sense.
All Definitions (ALLDEFS): In the case that
there are multiple definitions for the MWE, cal-
culate the lexical overlap for each independently
and take a majority vote; in the case of a tie, label
the component as non-compositional.
Idiom Tag (ITAG): In Wiktionary, there is fa-
cility for users to tag definitions as idiomatic.
1
If,
for a given MWE, there are definitions tagged as
idiomatic, use only those definitions; if there are
no such definitions, use the full set of definitions.
3.2 Synonym-based Definition Expansion
In some cases, a component is not explicitly men-
tioned in a definition, but a synonym does occur,
indicating that the definition is compositional in
that component. In order to capture synonym-
based matches, we optionally look for synonyms
of the component word in the definition,
2
and ex-
pand our notion of lexical overlap to include these
synonyms.
For example, for the MWE china clay, the defi-
nition is kaolin, which includes neither of the com-
ponents. However, we find the component word
clay in the definition for kaolin, as shown below.
A fine clay, rich in kaolinite, used in ce-
ramics, paper-making, etc.
This method is compatible with the three
definition-based similarity methods described
above, and indicated by the +SYN suffix (e.g.
FIRSTDEF+SYN is FIRSTDEF with synonym-
based expansion).
3.3 Translations
A third information source in Wiktionary that can
be used to predict compositionality is sense-level
translation data. Due to the user-generated na-
ture of Wiktionary, the set of languages for which

tionary and Wiktionary+Wikipedia over our two
datasets.
translations are provided varies greatly across lexi-
cal entries. Our approach is to take whatever trans-
lations happen to exist in Wiktionary for a given
MWE, and where there are translations in that lan-
guage for the component of interest, use the LCS-
based method of Salehi and Cook (2013) to mea-
sure the string similarity between the translation
of the MWE and the translation of the compo-
nents. Unlike Salehi and Cook (2013), however,
we do not use development data to select the opti-
mal set of languages in a supervised manner, and
instead simply take the average of the string simi-
larity scores across the available languages. In the
case of more than one translation in a given lan-
guage, we use the maximum string similarity for
each pairing of MWE and component translation.
Unlike the definition and synonym-based ap-
proach, the translation-based approach will pro-
duce real rather than binary values. To combine
the two approaches, we discretise the scores given
by the translation approach. In the case of dis-
agreement between the two approaches, we label
the given MWE as non-compositional. This re-
sults in higher recall and lower precision for the
task of detecting compositionality.
3.4 An Analysis of Wiktionary Coverage
A dictionary-based method is only as good as the
dictionary it is applied to. In the case of MWE
compositionality analysis, our primary concern is
lexical coverage in Wiktionary, i.e., what propor-
tion of a representative set of MWEs is contained
in Wiktionary. We measure lexical coverage rela-
tive to the two datasets used in this research (de-
scribed in detail in Section 4), namely 90 En-
glish noun compounds (ENCs) and 160 English
verb particle constructions (EVPCs). In each case,
we calculated the proportion of the dataset that
is found in Wiktionary, Wiktionary+Wikipedia
(where we back off to a Wikipedia document in the
case that a MWE is not found in Wiktionary) and
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998). The results are found
in Table 1, and indicate perfect coverage in Wik-
tionary+Wikipedia for the ENCs, and very high
coverage for the EVPCs. In both cases, the cov-
erage of WordNet is substantially lower, although
still respectable, at around 90%.
4 Datasets
As mentioned above, we evaluate our method over
the same two datasets as Salehi and Cook (2013)
(which were later used, in addition to a third
dataset of German noun compounds, in Salehi
et al. (2014)): (1) 90 binary English noun com-
pounds (ENCs, e.g. spelling bee or swimming
pool); and (2) 160 English verb particle construc-
tions (EVPCs, e.g. stand up and give away). Our
results are not directly comparable with those of
Salehi and Cook (2013) and Salehi et al. (2014),
however, who evaluated in terms of a regression
task, modelling the overall compositionality of the
MWE. In our case, the task setup is a binary clas-
sification task relative to each of the two compo-
nents of the MWE.
The ENC dataset was originally constructed by
Reddy et al. (2011), and annotated on a contin-
uous [0, 5] scale for both overall compositional-
ity and the component-wise compositionality of
each of the modifier and head noun. The sampling
was random in an attempt to make the dataset bal-
anced, with 48% of compositional English noun
compounds, of which 51% are compositional in
the first component and 60% are compositional in
the second component. We generate discrete la-
bels by discretising the component-wise composi-
tionality scores based on the partitions [0, 2.5] and
(2.5, 5]. On average, each NC in this dataset has
1.4 senses (definitions) in Wiktionary.
The EVPC dataset was constructed by Ban-
nard (2006), and manually annotated for com-
positionality on a binary scale for each of the
head verb and particle. For the 160 EVPCs,
76% are verb-compositional and 48% are particle-
compositional. On average, each EVPC in this
dataset has 3.0 senses (definitions) in Wiktionary.
5 Experiments
The baseline for each dataset takes the form of
looking for a user-annotated idiom tag in the Wik-
tionary lexical entry for the MWE: if there is an id-
iomatic tag, both components are considered to be
non-compositional; otherwise, both components
are considered to be compositional. We expect
this method to suffer from low precision for two

Table 2: Compositionality prediction results over the ENC dataset, relative to the first component (the
modifier noun) and the second component (the head noun)
reasons: first, the guidelines given to the annota-
tors of our datasets might be different from what
Wiktionary contributors assume to be an idiom.
Second, the baseline method assumes that for any
non-compositional MWE, all components must be
equally non-compositional, despite the wealth of
MWEs where one or more components are com-
positional (e.g. from the Wiktionary guidelines
for idiom inclusion,
3
computer chess, basketball
player, telephone box).
We also compare our method with: (1) “LCS”,
the string similarity-based method of Salehi and
Cook (2013), in which 54 languages are used;
(2) “DS”, the monolingual distributional similarity
method of Salehi et al. (2014); (3) “DS+DSL2”,
the multilingual distributional similarity method
of Salehi et al. (2014), including supervised lan-
guage selection for a given dataset, based on cross-
validation; and (4) “LCS+DS+DSL2”, whereby
the first three methods are combined using a su-
pervised support vector regression model. In
each case, the continuous output of the model
is equal-width discretised to generate a binary
classification. We additionally present results for
the combination of each of the six methods pro-
posed in this paper with LCS, DS and DSL2, us-
ing a linear-kernel support vector machine (rep-
resented with the suffix “
COMB(LCS+DS+DSL2)
” for
a given method). The results are based on cross-
3
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
Wiktionary:Idioms_that_survived_RFD
validation, and for direct comparability, the parti-
tions are exactly the same as Salehi et al. (2014).
Tables 2 and 3 provide the results when our pro-
posed method for detecting non-compositionality
is applied to the ENC and EVPC datasets, respec-
tively. The inclusion of translation data was found
to improve all of precision, recall and F-score
across the board for all of the proposed methods.
For reasons of space, results without translation
data are therefore omitted from the paper.
Overall, the simple unsupervised methods pro-
posed in this paper are comparable with the unsu-
pervised and supervised state-of-the-art methods
of Salehi and Cook (2013) and Salehi et al. (2014),
with ITAG achieving the highest F-score for the
ENC dataset and for the verb components of the
EVPC dataset. The inclusion of synonyms boosts
results in most cases.
When we combine each of our proposed meth-
ods with the string and distributional similar-
ity methods of Salehi and Cook (2013) and
Salehi et al. (2014), we see substantial improve-
ments over the comparable combined method of
“LCS+DS+DSL2” in most cases, demonstrating
both the robustness of the proposed methods and
their complementarity with the earlier methods. It
is important to reinforce that the proposed meth-
ods make no language-specific assumptions and
are therefore applicable to any type of MWE and
any language, with the only requirement being that
the MWE of interest be listed in the Wiktionary for

6 Error Analysis
We analysed all items in each dataset where the
system score differed from that of the human
annotators. For both datasets, the majority of
incorrectly-labelled items were compositional but
predicted to be non-compositional by our sys-
tem, as can be seen in the relatively low preci-
sion scores in Tables 2 and 3. In many of these
cases, the prediction based on definitions and syn-
onyms was compositional but the prediction based
on translations was non-compositional. In such
cases, we arbitrarily break the tie by labelling the
instance as non-compositional, and in doing so
favour recall over precision.
Some of the incorrectly-labelled ENCs have
a gold-standard annotation of around 2.5, or in
other words are semi-compositional. For exam-
ple, the compositionality score for game in game
plan is 2.82/5, but our system labels it as non-
compositional; a similar thing happens with figure
and the EVPC figure out. Such cases demonstrate
the limitation of approaches to MWE composi-
tionality that treat the problem as a binary clas-
sification task.
On average, the EVPCs have three senses,
which is roughly twice the number for ENCs. This
makes the prediction of compositionality harder,
as there is more information to combine across (an
effect that is compounded with the addition of syn-
onyms and translations). In future work, we hope
to address this problem by first finding the sense
which matches best with the sentences given to the
annotators.
7 Conclusion
We have proposed an unsupervised approach for
predicting the compositionality of an MWE rel-
ative to each of its components, based on lexi-
cal overlap using Wiktionary, optionally incorpo-
rating synonym and translation data. Our experi-
ments showed that the various instantiations of our
approach are superior to previous state-of-the-art
supervised methods. All code to replicate the re-
sults in this paper has been made publicly avail-
able at https://github.com/bsalehi/
