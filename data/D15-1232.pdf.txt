Abstract
In this study, we consider a summariza-
tion method using the document level sim-
ilarity based on embeddings, or distributed
representations of words, where we as-
sume that an embedding of each word can
represent its “meaning.” We formalize our
task as the problem of maximizing a sub-
modular function defined by the negative
summation of the nearest neighbors’ dis-
tances on embedding distributions, each
of which represents a set of word embed-
dings in a document. We proved the sub-
modularity of our objective function and
that our problem is asymptotically related
to the KL-divergence between the prob-
ability density functions that correspond
to a document and its summary in a con-
tinuous space. An experiment using a
real dataset demonstrated that our method
performed better than the existing method
based on sentence-level similarity.
1 Introduction
Document summarization aims to rephrase a doc-
ument in a short form called a summary while
keeping its “meaning.” In the present study, we
aim to characterize the meaning of a document us-
ing embeddings or distributed representations of
words in the document, where an embedding of
each word is represented as a real valued vector
in a Euclidean space that corresponds to the word
(Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b).
Many previous studies have investigated sum-
marization (Lin and Bilmes, 2010; Lin and
Bilmes, 2011; Lin and Bilmes, 2012; Sipos et al.,
2012; Morita et al., 2013), but to the best of our
knowledge, only one (K?ageb¨ack et al., 2014) con-
sidered a direct summarization method using em-
beddings, where the summarization problem was
formalized as maximizing a submodular function
defined by the summation of cosine similarities
based on sentence embeddings. Essentially, this
method assumes linear meanings since the objec-
tive function is characterized by the summation of
sentence-level similarities. However, this assump-
tion is not always valid in real documents, and thus
there may be a better combination of two other
sentences than the best and second best sentences
in terms of similarity in a document.
In this study, we consider a summarization
method based on document-level similarity, where
we assume the non-linearity of meanings. First,
we examine an objective function defined by a co-
sine similarity based on document embeddings in-
stead of sentence embeddings. Unfortunately, in
contrast to our intuition, this similarity is not sub-
modular, which we disprove later. Thus, we pro-
pose a valid submodular function based on em-
bedding distributions, each of which represents
a set of word embeddings in a document, as the
document-level similarity. Our objective func-
tion is calculated based on the nearest neighbors’
distances on embedding distributions, which can
be proved to be asymptotically related to KL-
divergence in a continuous space. Several stud-
ies (Lerman and McDonald, 2009; Haghighi and
Vanderwende, 2009) have addressed summariza-
tion using KL-divergence, but they calculated KL-
divergence based on word distributions in a dis-
crete space. In other words, our study is the first
attempt to summarize by asymptotically estimat-
ing KL-divergence based on embedding distribu-
tions in a continuous space. In addition, they in-
volved the inference of complex models, whereas
our method is quite simple but still powerful.
2 Preliminaries
We treat a document as a bag-of-sentences and
a sentence as a bag-of-words. Formally, let
D be a document, and we refer to an element
1984
s ? D of a sentence and w ? s of a word.
We denote the size of a set S by |S|. Note
that D and s are defined as multisets. For
example, we can define a document such as
D := {s
1
, s
2
} with s
1
:= {just, do, it}
and s
2
:= {never, say, never}, which cor-
respond to two sentences “Just do it” and “Never
say never,” respectively. From the definition, we
have |s
1
| = 3 and |s
2
| = 3.
2.1 Submodularity
Submodularity is a property of set functions,
which is similar to the convexity or concavity of
continuous functions.
We formally define submodularity as follows.
Definition 1 (Submodularity). Given a setX , a set
function f : 2
X
? R is called submodular if for
any two sets S
1
and S
2
such that S
1
? S
2
? X
and element x ? X \ S
2
,
f(S
1
? {x})? f(S
1
) ? f(S
2
? {x})? f(S
2
).
For simplicity, we define f
S
(x) := f(S ?
{x}) ? f(S), which is called the marginal value
of x with respect to S. A set function f is called
monotone if f
S
(x) ? 0 for any set S ? X and
element x ? X \ S.
If a set function f is monotone submodular, we
can approximate the optimal solution efficiently
by a simple greedy algorithm, which iteratively
selects x
?
= argmax
x?X\S
i
f
S
i
(x) where ties
are broken arbitrarily, and we substitute S
i+1
=
S
i
? {x
?
} in the i-th iteration beginning with
S
0
= ?. This algorithm is quite simple but it is
guaranteed to find a near optimal solution within
1? 1/e ? 0.63 (Calinescu et al., 2007).
2.2 Embedding
An embedding or distributed representation of a
word is a real valued vector in an m-dimensional
Euclidean space R
m
, which expresses the “mean-
ing” of the word. We denote an embedding of a
word w by ~w ? R
m
. If for any two words w
1
and
w
2
, the meaning ofw
1
is similar to that ofw
2
, then
~w
1
is expected to be near to ~w
2
.
A recent study (Mikolov et al., 2013a) showed
that a simple log-bilinear model can learn high
quality embeddings to obtain a better result than
recurrent neural networks, where the concept of
embeddings was originally proposed in studies of
neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003). In
the present study, we use the CW Vector
1
and
W2V Vector
2
which are also used in the previous
study (K?ageb¨ack et al., 2014).
3 Proposed Method
In this study, we focus on a summarization task
as sentence selection in a document. The opti-
mization framework in our task is the same as in
the previous study and formalized in Algorithm 1,
wherew
s
represents the pre-defined weight or cost
of a sentence s, e.g., sentence length, and r is
its scaling factor. This algorithm, called modified
greedy, was proposed in (Lin and Bilmes, 2010)
and interestingly performed better than the state-
of-the-art abstractive approach as shown in (Lin
and Bilmes, 2011). Note that we have omitted the
notation of D from f for simplicity because D is
fixed in an optimization process.

Similarity Based on Document Embeddings
First, we examine an objective function f
Cos
de-
fined by a cosine similarity based on document
embeddings. An embedding of a document D is
defined as v
D
:=
?
s?D
?
w?s
~w. We formalize
the objective function f
Cos
as follows.
f
Cos
(C) :=
v
C
· v
D
?v
C
? ?v
D
?
.
Note that the optimal solution does not change, if
we use an average embedding v
D
/
?
s?D
|s| in-
stead of v
D
. The next theorem shows that a solu-
tion of f
Cos
by Algorithm 1 is not guaranteed to be
near optimal.
Theorem 1. f
Cos
is not submodular.

Proof. A simple counterexample is sufficient to
prove the theorem. Let us consider D := {s
1
:=
{w
1
}, s
2
:= {w
2
}, s
3
:= {w
3
}, s
4
:= {w
4
}}
with corresponding vectors ~w
1
:= (1, 1), ~w
2
:=
(1, 2), ~w
3
:= (1,?1), and ~w
4
:= (1,?2), re-
spectively. In this case, the document embedding
v
D
is (4, 0). We set C
1
:= {s
1
} and C
2
:=
{s
1
, s
2
}. Clearly, C
1
? C
2
. However, we ob-
tain f
Cos
C
1
(s
4
) = f
Cos
({s
1
, s
4
}) ? f
Cos
({s
1
}) ?
0.187 and f
Cos
C
2
(s
4
) = f
Cos
({s
1
, s
2
, s
4
}) ?
f
Cos
({s
1
, s
2
}) ? 0.394. Therefore, we have
f
Cos
C
2
(s
4
) > f
Cos
C
1
(s
4
).
Similarity Based on Embedding Distributions
We propose a valid submodular objective function
f
NN
based on embedding distributions. The key
observation is that for any two embedding distri-
butionsA andB, whenA is similar toB, each em-
bedding in A should be near to some embedding
in B. In order to formalize this idea, we define the
nearest neighbor of a word w in a summary C as
n(w,C) := argmin
v?s:s?C,~w 6=~v
d(~w,~v), where d
is the Euclidian distance in the embedding space,
i.e., d(~w,~v) := ?~w ? ~v?. We denote the dis-
tance of w to its nearest neighbor n := n(w,C)
by N(w,C) := d(~w,~n). Finally, we define f
NN
as
follows:
f
NN
(C) := ?
?
s?D
?
w?s
g(N(w,C)),
where g is a non-decreasing scaling function. The
function f
NN
represents the negative value ?? of
dissimilarity ? between a document and summary
based on embedding distributions. Note that we
can use sentence embeddings instead of word em-
beddings as embedding distributions, although we
focus on word embeddings in this section.
The next theorem shows the monotone submod-
ularity of our objective function, which means that
a solution of f
NN
by Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to
be near optimal.
Theorem 2. f
NN
is monotone submodular.
Proof. (Monotonicity) First, we prove the mono-
tonicity. For simplicity, we use the follow-
ing two abbreviations: C
s
:= C ? {s} and
?
D
w
:=
?
s?D
?
w?s
. For any set C ?
D of sentences and sentence s ? D \ C,
we have f
NN
C
(s) = f
NN
(C
s
) ? f
NN
(C) =
?
D
w
(g(N(w,C))? g(N(w,C
s
))). Since C ?
C
s
, obviously N(w,C) ? N(w,C
s
) holds.
Therefore, we obtain f
NN
C
(s) ? 0 from the non-
decreasing property of g.
(Submodularity) Next, we prove the submodu-
larity. For any two sets C
1
and C
2
of sentences
such that C
1
? C
2
? D, and sentence s ? D\C
2
,
we have f
NN
C
1
(s)? f
NN
C
2
(s) = f
NN
(C
s
1
)? f
NN
(C
1
)?
(f
NN
(C
s
2
) ? f
NN
(C
2
)) =
?
D
w
(g(N(w,C
1
)) ?
g(N(w,C
s
1
)) ? g(N(w,C
2
)) + g(N(w,C
s
2
))).
Let ? := g(N(w,C
1
)) ? g(N(w,C
s
1
)) ?
g(N(w,C
2
)) + g(N(w,C
s
2
)).
If n(w,C
s
2
) ? s, then n(w,C
s
1
) ? s holds,
since C
s
1
? C
s
2
. This means that N(w,C
s
2
) =
N(w,C
s
1
) = N(w, {s}). Clearly, N(w,C
1
) ?
N(w,C
2
), since C
1
? C
2
. Therefore, we obtain
? ? 0 from the non-decreasing property of g.
If n(w,C
s
2
) /? s and n(w,C
s
1
) /? s, we
have N(w,C
s
1
) = N(w,C
1
) and N(w,C
s
2
) =
N(w,C
2
). This indicates that ? = 0.
If n(w,C
s
2
) /? s and n(w,C
s
1
) ? s, so sim-
ilarly N(w,C
s
1
) ? N(w,C
1
) and N(w,C
s
2
) =
N(w,C
2
) hold. Therefore, we obtain ? ? 0.
The objective function f
NN
is simply heuristic
for small documents, but the next theorem shows
that f
NN
is asymptotically related to an approxima-
tion of KL-divergence in a continuous space, if g
is a logarithmic function. This result implies that
we can use mathematical techniques of a contin-
uous space for different NLP tasks, by mapping a
document into a continuous space based on word
embeddings.
Theorem 3. Suppose that we have a document D
and two summaries C
1
and C
2
such that |C
1
| =
|C
2
|, which are samples drawn from some proba-
bility density functions p, q, and r, i.e., D ? p,
C
1
? q, and C
2
? r, respectively. If the scal-
ing function g of f
NN
is a logarithmic function,
the order relation of the expectations of f
NN
(C
1
)
and f
NN
(C
2
) is asymptotically the same as that of
the KL-divergences D
KL
(p || r) and D
KL
(p || q),
i.e., E[f
NN
(C
1
)] ? E[f
NN
(C
2
)] > 0 ? D
KL
(p ||
r) ? D
KL
(p || q) > 0, as |D| ? ?, |C
1
| ? ?,
and |C
2
| ? ?.
Proof. Let m be the dimension on embeddings.
Using a divergence estimator based on nearest
neighbor distances in (P´erez-Cruz, 2009; Wang
et al., 2009), we can approximate D
KL
(p || q)
by

4 Experiments
We compared our two proposed methods DocEmb
and EmbDist with two state-of-the-art methods
SenEmb and TfIdf. The first two methods
DocEmb and EmbDist represent Algorithm 1
with our proposed objective functions f
Cos
and
f
NN
, respectively. TfIdf represents Algorithm 1
with an objective function based on the sum of co-
sine similarities of tf-idf vectors that correspond
to sentences, which was proposed in (Lin and
Bilmes, 2011). SenEmb uses a cosine similar-
ity measure based on embeddings instead of tf-idf
vectors in the same framework as TfIdf, which
was proposed in (K?ageb¨ack et al., 2014).
We conducted an experiment with almost the
same setting as in the previous study, where they
used the Opinosis dataset (Ganesan et al., 2010).
This dataset is a collection of user reviews in 51
different topics such as hotels, cars, and products;
thus, it is more appropriate for evaluating sum-
marization of user-generated content than well-
known DUC datasets, which consist of formal
news articles. Each topic in the collection com-
prises 50–575 sentences and includes four and five
gold standard summaries created by human au-
thors, each of which comprises 1–3 sentences.
We ran an optimization process to choose sen-
tences within 100 words
3
by setting the summary
size and weights as ` = 100 and w
s
= |s|
for any sentence s, respectively. As for TfIdf
and SenEmb, we set a cluster size of k-means as
k = |D|/5 and chose the best value for a threshold
coefficient ?, trade-off coefficient ?, and the scal-
ing factor r, as in (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). Note
that our functions DocEmb and EmbDist have
only one parameter r, and we similarly chose the
best value of r. Regarding DocEmb, EmbDist,
and SenEmb, we used the best embeddings from
the CW Vector and W2V Vector for each method,
and created document and sentence embeddings
by averaging word embeddings with tf-idf weights
since it performed better in this experiment. In the
case of EmbDist, we used a variant of f
NN
based
3
The previous work used a sentence-based constraint as
` = 2 and w
s
= 1, but we changed the setting since the
variation in length has a noticeable impact on ROUGE scores
as suggested in (Hong et al., 2014).

Table 1: ROUGE-N (R-N) metrics of DocEmb,
EmbDist, SenEmb, and TfIdf.
on distributions of sentence embeddings. In ad-
dition, we examined three scaling functions: log-
arithmic, linear, and exponential functions, i.e.,
lnx, x, e
x
, respectively.
We calculated the ROUGE-N metric (Lin,
2004)
4
, which is a widely-used evaluation met-
ric for summarization methods. ROUGE-N is
based on the co-occurrence statistics of N-grams,
and especially ROUGE-1 has been shown to have
the highest correlation with human summaries
(Lin and Hovy, 2003). ROUGE-N is similar
to the BLEU metric for machine translation, but
ROUGE-N is a recall-based metric while BLEU is
a precision-based metric.
Table 1 shows the results obtained for ROUGE-
N (N ? 4) using DocEmb, EmbDist, SenEmb,
and TfIdf. ApxOpt represents the approxima-
tion results of the optimal solution in our prob-
lem, where we optimized ROUGE-1 with the gold
standard summaries by Algorithm 1. The ob-
tained results indicate that our proposed method
EmbDist with exponential scaling performed the
best for ROUGE-1, which is the best metric in
terms of correlation with human summaries. The
W2V Vector was the best choice for EmbDist.
Furthermore, the other proposed method DocEmb
performed better than the state-of-the-art methods
SenEmb and TfIdf, although DocEmb is not
theoretically guaranteed to obtain a near optimal
solution. These results imply that our methods
based on the document-level similarity can capture
more complex meanings than the sentence-level
similarity. On the other hand, TfIdf with tf-idf
vectors performed the worst for ROUGE-1. A pos-
sible reason is that a wide variety of expressions
by users made it difficult to calculate similarities.
This also suggests that embedding-based methods

parameters: -n 4 -m -a -l 100 -x -c 95 -r 1000 -f A -p 0.5 -t 0.

naturally have robustness for user-generated con-
tent.
In the case of N ? 2, TfIdf performed the best
for ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-3, while EmbDist
with logarithmic scaling is better than TfIdf
for ROUGE-4. According to (Lin and Hovy,
2003), the higher order ROUGE-N is worse than
ROUGE-1 since it tends to score grammatical-
ity rather than content. Conversely, Rankel et al.
(2013) reports that there is a dataset where the
higher order ROUGE-N is correlated with human
summaries well. We may need to conduct human
judgments to decide which metric is the best in
this dataset for more accurate comparison. How-
ever, it is still important that our simple objective
functions can obtain good results competing with
the state-of-the-art methods.
5 Conclusion
In this study, we proposed simple but power-
ful summarization methods using the document-
level similarity based on embeddings, or dis-
tributed representations of words. Our experimen-
tal results demonstrated that the proposed meth-
ods performed better than the existing state-of-the-
art methods based on the sentence-level similar-
ity. This implies that the document-level similar-
ity can capture more complex meanings than the
sentence-level similarity.
Recently, Kusner et al. (2015) independently
discovered a similar definition to our objective
function f
NN
through a different approach. They
constructed a dissimilarity measure based on a
framework using Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD)
developed in the image processing field (Rubner
et al., 1998; Rubner et al., 2000). EMD is a con-
sistent measure of distance between two distribu-
tions of points. Interestingly, their heuristic lower
bound of EMD is exactly the same as ?f
NN
with a
linear scaling function, i.e., g(x) = x. Moreover,
they showed that this bound appears to be tight
in real datasets. This suggests that our intuitive
framework can theoretically connect the two well-
known measures, KL-divergence and EMD, based
on the scaling of distance. Note that, to the best of
our knowledge, there is currently no known study
that considers such a theoretical relationship.
In future research, we will explore other scal-
ing functions suitable for our problem or different
problems. A promising direction is to consider a
relative scaling function to extract a biased sum-
mary of a document. This direction should be use-
ful for query-focused summarization tasks.
