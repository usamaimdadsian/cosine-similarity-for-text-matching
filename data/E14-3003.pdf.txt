Abstract
A study of the usefulness of features ex-
tracted from unsupervised methods is pro-
posed. The usefulness of these features
will be studied on the task of performing
named entity recognition within one clin-
ical sub-domain as well as on the task of
adapting a named entity recognition model
to a new clinical sub-domain. Four named
entity types, all very relevant for clini-
cal information extraction, will be studied:
Disorder, Finding, Pharmaceutical Drug
and Body Structure. The named entity
recognition will be performed using con-
ditional random fields. As unsupervised
features, a clustering of the semantic rep-
resentation of words obtained from a ran-
dom indexing word space will be used.
1 Introduction
Creating the annotated corpus needed for training
a NER (named entity recognition) model is costly.
This is particularly the case for texts in specialised
domains, for which expert annotators are often re-
quired. In addition, the need for expert annotators
also limits the possibilities of using crowdsourcing
approaches (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk). Fea-
tures from unsupervised machine-learning meth-
ods, for which no labelled training data is required,
have, however, been shown to improve the per-
formance of NER systems (Jonnalagadda et al.,
2012). It is therefore likely that by incorporating
features from unsupervised methods, it is possible
to reduce the amount of training data needed to
achieve a fixed level of performance.
Due to differences in the use of language, an
NLP system developed for, or trained on, text
from one sub-domain often shows a drop in per-
formance when applied on texts from another sub-
domain (Martinez et al., 2013). This has the ef-
fect that when performing NER on a new sub-
domain, annotated text from this new targeted sub-
domain might be required, even when there are
annotated corpora from other domains. It would,
however, be preferable to be able to apply a NER
model trained on text from one sub-domain on an-
other sub-domain, with only a minimum of addi-
tional data from this other targeted sub-domain.
Incorporating features from unsupervised meth-
ods might limit the amount of additional annotated
data needed for adapting a NER model to a new
sub-domain.
The proposed study aims at investigating the
usefulness of unsupervised features, both for NER
within one sub-domain and for domain adaptation
of a NER model. The study has two hypotheses.
• Within one subdomain:
For reaching the same level of performance
when training a NER model, less training
data is required when unsupervised features
are used.
• For adapting a model trained on one subdo-
main to a new targeted subdomain:
For reaching the same level of performance
when adapting a NER model to a new subdo-
main, less additional training data is required
in the new targeted subdomain when unsu-
pervised features are used.
For both hypotheses, the level of performance is
defined in terms of F-score.
The proposed study will be carried out on dif-
ferent sub-domains within the specialised text do-
main of clinical text.
2 Related research
There are a number of previous studies on named
entity recognition in clinical text. For instance,
a corpus annotated for the entities Condition,
21
Drug/Device and Locus was used for training
a support vector machine with uneven margins
(Roberts et al., 2008) and a corpus annotated for
the entities Finding, Substance and Body was used
for training a conditional random fields (CRF) sys-
tem (Wang, 2009) as well as for training an en-
semble of different classifiers (Wang and Patrick,
2009). Most studies have, however, been con-
ducted on the i2b2 medication challenge corpus
and the i2b2 challenge on concepts, assertions,
and relations corpus. Conditional random fields
(Patrick and Li, 2010) as well as an ensemble clas-
sifier (Doan et al., 2012) has for instance been used
for extracting the entity Medication names from
the medication challenge corpus, while all but the
best among the top-performing systems used CRF
for extracting the entities Medical Problem, Test
and Treatment from the i2b2 challenge on con-
cepts, assertions, and relations corpus (Uzuner et
al., 2011). The best system (de Bruijn et al., 2011)
used semi-Markov HMM, and in addition to the
features used by most of the other systems (e.g.
tokens/lemmas/stems, orthographics, affixes, part-
of-speech, output of terminology matching), this
system also used features extracted from hierarchi-
cal word clusters on un-annotated text. For con-
structing the clusters, they used Brown clustering,
and represented the feature as a 7-bit showing to
what cluster a word belonged.
Outside of the biomedical domain, there are
many studies on English corpora, which have
shown that using features extracted from clusters
constructed on unlabelled corpora improves per-
formance of NER models, especially when using
a smaller amount of training data (Miller et al.,
2004; Freitag, 2004). This approach has also been
shown to be successful for named entity recogni-
tion in other languages, e.g. German, Dutch and
Spanish (T¨ackstr¨om et al., 2012), as well as on
related NLP tasks (Biemann et al., 2007), and
there are NER tools that automatically incorpo-
rate features extracted from unsupervised methods
(Stanford, 2012). There are a number of addi-
tional studies within the biomedical domain, e.g.
using features from Brown and other clustering
approaches (Stenetorp et al., 2012) or from k-
means clustered vectors from a neural networks-
based word space implementation (Pyysalo et al.,
2014). Jonnalagadda et al. (2012) also present a
study in which unsupervised features are used for
training a model on the i2b2 challenge on con-
cepts, assertions, and relations corpus. As un-
annotated corpus, they used a corpus created by
extracting Medline abstracts that are indexed with
the publication type ”clinical trials”. They then
built a semantic representation of this corpus in
the form of a random indexing-based word space.
This representation was then used for extracting a
number of similar words to each word in the i2b2
challenge on concepts, assertions, and relations
corpus, which were used as features when training
a CRF system. The parameters of the random in-
dexing model were selected by letting the nearest
neighbours of a word vote for one of the UMLS
categories Medical Problem, Treatment and Test
according to the category of the neighbour, and by
comparing the category winning the vote to the ac-
tual category of the word. The authors motivate
their choice of using random indexing for creat-
ing features with that this method is scalable to
very large corpora without requiring large compu-
tational resources.
The method proposed here is similar to the
method used by Jonnalagadda et al. (2012). How-
ever, the focus of the proposed study is to explore
to what extent unsupervised features can help a
machine learning system trained only on very lit-
tle data. It is therefore not feasible to use the large
number of features that would be generated by
using neighbouring words, as that would require
a large training data set to ensure that there are
enough training examples for each generated fea-
ture. Therefore, the proposed method instead fur-
ther processes the word space model by construct-
ing clusters of semantically related words, thereby
reducing the number of generated features, similar
to the approach by Pyysalo et al. (2014).
3 Materials and previous results
Texts from three different clinical sub-domains:
cardiac ICU (intensive care unit), orthopaedic ER
(emergency room), and internal medicine ER have
been annotated (Tables 1-3).

All texts are written
in Swedish, and they all share the characteristics
of text types written under time pressure; all of
them containing many abbreviations and incom-
plete sentences. There are, however, also differ-
ences in e.g. what abbreviations are used and what

entities that are frequently mentioned.
The texts from cardiac ICU and orthopaedic ER
will be treated as existing annotations in a cur-
rent domain, whereas internal medicine ER will
be treated as the new target domain. Approxi-
mately a third of the texts from internal medicine
ER have been doubly annotated, and an evaluation
set has been created by manually resolving differ-
ences between the two annotators (Skeppstedt et
al., 2014). This evaluation subset will be used as
held-out data for evaluating the NER task.
The following four entity categories have been
annotated (Skeppstedt et al., 2014): (1) Disorder
(a disease or abnormal condition that is not mo-
mentary and that has an underlying pathological
process), (2) Finding (a symptom reported by the
patient, an observation made by the physician or
the result of a medical examination of the patient),
(3) Pharmaceutical Drug (not limited to generic
name or trade name, but includes also e.g. drugs
expressed by their effect, such as painkiller or
sleeping pill). (4) Body Structure (an anatomically
defined body part).
These three annotated corpora will be used in
the proposed study, together with a large corpus
of un-annotated text from which unsupervised fea-
tures will be extracted. This large corpus will be a
subset of the Stockholm EPR corpus (Dalianis et
al., 2009), which is a large corpus of clinical text
written in Swedish.
Named entity recognition on the internal
medicine ER part of the annotated corpus has al-
ready been studied, and results on the evaluation
set were an F-score of 0.81 for the entity Dis-
order, 0.69 for Finding, 0.88 for Pharmaceutical
Drug, 0.85 for Body Structure and 0.78 for the
combined category Disorder + Finding (Skeppst-
edt et al., 2014). Features used for training the
model on the development/training part of the in-
ternal medicine ER corpus were the lemma forms
of the words, their part of speech, their semantic
category in used vocabulary lists, their word con-
stituents (if the words were compounds) as well
as the orthographics of the words. A narrow con-
text window was used, as shown by the entries
marked in boldface in Figure 1. As terminologies,
the Swedish versions of SNOMED CT

, MeSH
3
,
ICD-10
4
, the Swedish medical list FASS
5
were
used, as well as a vocabulary list of non-medical
words, compiled from the Swedish Parole corpus
(Gellerstam et al., 2000).
4 Methodological background
The proposed method consists of using the train-
ing data first for parameter setting (through n-
fold cross-validation) and thereafter for training a
model using the best parameters. This model is
then to be evaluated on held-out data. A number
of rounds with parameter setting and training will
be carried out, where each new round will make
use of an increasingly larger subset of the training
data. Two versions of parameter setting and model
training will be carried out for each round; one
using features obtained from unsupervised meth-
ods on un-annotated text and one in which such
features are not used. The results of the two ver-
sions are then to be compared, with the hypothesis
that the model incorporating unsupervised meth-
ods will perform better, at least for small training
data sizes.
To accomplish this, the proposed method makes
use of four main components: (1) A system for
training a NER model given features extracted
from an annotated corpus. As this component, a
conditional random fields (CRF) system will be
used. (2) A system for automatic parameter set-
ting. As a large number of models are to be con-
structed on different sizes of the training data, for
which optimal parameters are likely to differ, pa-
rameters for each set of training data has to be
determined automatically for it to be feasible to

dom indexing based word space model will used.
(4) A system for turning the semantic representa-

for the NER model. As this component, clustering
will be used.
To give a methodological background, the theo-
retical foundation for the four components will be
described.
4.1 Conditional random fields
Conditional random fields (CRF or CRFs), intro-
duced by Lafferty et al. (2001), is a machine learn-
ing method suitable for segmenting and labelling
sequential data and therefore often used for e.g.
named entity recognition. As described in the re-
lated research section, CRFs have been used in a
number of studies for extracting entities from clin-
ical text. In contrast to many other types of data,
observed data points for sequential data, such as
text, are dependent on other observed data points.
Such dependences between data points are prac-
tical to describe within the framework of graphi-
cal models (Bishop, 2006, p. 359), to which CRF
belongs (Sutton and McCallum, 2006, p. 1). In
the special, but frequently used, case of linear
chain CRF, the output variables are linked in a
chain. Apart from being dependent on the input
variables, each output variable is then condition-
ally independent on all other output variables, ex-
cept on the previous and following output variable,
given these two neighbouring output variables. In
a named entity recognition task, the output vari-
ables are the named entity classes that are to be
predicted and the observed input variables are ob-
served features of the text, such as the tokens or
their part-of-speech.
CRF is closely related to Hidden Markov Mod-
els, which is also typically described as a graph-
ical model. A difference, however, is that Hid-
den Markov Models belongs to the class of gener-
ative models, whereas CRF is a conditional model
(Sutton and McCallum, 2006, p. 1). Generative
models model the joint distribution between input
variables and the variables that are to be predicted
(Bishop, 2006, p. 43). In contrast, CRF and other
conditional models instead directly model the con-
ditional distribution, enabling the use of a larger
24
feature set (Sutton and McCallum, 2006, p. 1).
For named entity recognition, the IOB-
encoding is typically used for encoding the out-
put variables. Tokens not annotated as an entity
are then encoded with the label O, whereas labels
for annotated tokens are prefixed with a B, if it
is the first token in the annotated chunk, and an
I otherwise (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008, pp. 763–
764). An example of this encoding is shown in the
last column in Figure 1. In this case, where there
are four types of entities, the model thus learns to
classify in 8+1 different classes: B-Disorder, I-
Disorder, B-Finding, I-Finding, B-Drug, I-Drug,
B-BodyStructure, I-BodyStructure and O.
The dependencies are defined by a large number
of (typically binary) feature functions of input and
output variables. E.g. is all of the following true?
• Output: The output at the current position is
I-Disorder
• Output: The output at the previous position is
B-Disorder
• Input: The token at the current position is
chest-pain
• Input: The token at the previous position is
experiences
A feature function in a linear chain CRF can
only include the values of the output variable in
current position and in the immediate previous po-
sition, whereas it can include, and thereby show a
dependence on, input variables from any position.
The CRF model is trained through setting
weights for the feature functions, which is carried
out by penalised maximum likelihood. Penalised
means that regularisation is used, and regularisa-
tion is performed by adding a penalty term, which
prevents the weights from reaching too large val-
ues, and thereby prevents over-fitting (Bishop,
2006, p. 10). The L1-norm and the L2-norm are
frequently used for regularisation (Tsuruoka et al.,
2009), and a variable C governs the importance
of the regularisation. Using the L1-norm also re-
sults in that if C is large enough, some of the
weights are driven to zero, resulting in a sparse
model and thereby the feature functions that those
weights control will not play any role in the model.
Thereby, complex models can be trained also on
data sets with a limited size, without being over-
fitted. However, a suitable value of C must still be
determined (Bishop, 2006, p. 145).
The plan for the proposed study is to use the
CRF package CRF++
6
, which has been used in a
number of previous NER studies, also in the med-
ical domain. The CRF++ package automatically
generates feature functions from user-defined tem-
plates. When using CRF++ as a linear chain CRF,
it generates one binary feature function for each
combination of output class, previous output class
and unique string in the training data that is ex-
panded by a template. This means that L * L *
M feature functions are generated for each tem-
plate, where L = the number of output classes and
M = the number of unique expanded strings. If
only the current token were to be used as a fea-
ture, the number of feature functions would be
9?9?|unique tokens in the corpus|. In practice,
a lot of other features are, however, used. Most of
these features will be of no use to the classifier,
which means that it is important to use an infer-
ence method that sets the weights of the feature
functions with irrelevant features to zero, thus an
inference method that promotes sparsity.
4.2 Parameter setting
As previously explained, a large number of mod-
els are to be constructed, which requires a simple
and efficient method for parameter setting. An ad-
vantage with using the L1-norm is that only one
parameter, the C-value, has to be optimised, as the
weights for feature functions are driven to zero for
feature functions that are not useful. The L1-norm
will therefore be used in the proposed study. A
very large feature set can then be used, without
running the risk of over-fitting the model. Features
will include those that have been used in previous
clinical NER studies (Jonnalagadda et al., 2012;
de Bruijn et al., 2011; Skeppstedt et al., 2014),
with a context window of four previous and four
following tokens.
When maximising the conditional log likeli-
hood of the parameters, the CRF++ program will
set parameters that are optimal for training the
model for the best micro-averaged results for the
four classes Disorder, Finding, Pharmaceutical
drug and Body structure. A hill climbing search
(Marsland, 2009, pp. 262–264) for finding a good
C-value will be used, starting with a value very
close to zero and thereafter changing it in a direc-
tion that improves the NER results. A decreas-
ingly smaller step size will be used for changing

can be observed.
4.3 Random indexing
Random indexing is one version of the word space
model, and as all word space models it is a method
for representing distributional semantics. The ran-
dom indexing method was originally devised by
Kanerva et al. (2000), to deal with the performance
problems (in terms of memory and computation
time) that were associated with the LSA/LSI im-
plementations at that time. Due to its computa-
tional efficiency, random indexing remains to be
a popular method when building distributional se-
mantics models on very large corpora, e.g. large
web corpora (Sahlgren and Karlgren, 2009) or
Medline abstracts (Jonnalagadda et al., 2012).
Distributional semantics is built on the distribu-
tional hypothesis, which states that ”Words with
similar meanings tend to occur in similar con-
texts”. If dermatitis and eczema often occur in
similar contexts, e.g. ”Patient complains of itch-
ing dermatitis” and ”Patient complains of itching
eczema”, it is likely that dermatitis and eczema
have a similar meaning. One possible method
of representing word co-occurrence information is
to construct a term-by-term co-occurrence matrix,
i.e. a matrix of dimensionality w × w, in which w
is the number of terms (unique semantic units, e.g.
words) in the corpus. The elements of the matrix
then contain the number of times each semantic
unit occurs in the context of each other semantic
unit (figure 2).
The context vectors of two semantic units can
then be compared as a measure of semantic sim-
ilarity between units, e.g. using the the euclid-
ian distance between normalised context vectors
or the cosine similarity.

itch: [0 1 1 ... 0]
patient: [-1 0 0 ... 0]
... [... ... ... ... ..]
     word w [0 0 -1 ... 0]
Figure 3: Index vectors.
The large dimension of a term-by-term ma-
trix leads, however, to scalability problems, and
the typical solution to this is to apply dimen-
sionality reduction on the matrix. In a semantic
space created by latent semantic analysis, for in-
stance, dimensionality reduction is performed by
applying the linear algebra matrix operation sin-
gular value decomposition (Landauer and Dutnais,
1997). Random indexing is another solution, in
which a matrix with a smaller dimension is created
from start, using the following method (Sahlgren
et al., 2008):
Each term in the data is assigned a unique rep-
resentation, called an index vector. The index vec-
tors all have the dimensionality d (where d ? 1000
but w). Most of the elements of the index vec-
tors are set to 0, but a few, randomly selected, el-
ements are set to either +1 or -1. (Usually around
1-2% of the elements.) Instead of having orthogo-
nal vectors, as is the case for the term-by-term ma-
trix, the index vectors are nearly orthogonal. (See
Figure 3.)
Each term in the data is also assigned a context
vector, also of the dimensionality d. Initially, all
elements in the context vectors are set to 0. The
context vector of each term is then updated by, for
every occurrence of the term in the corpus, adding
the index vectors of the neighboring words. The
neighboring words are called the context window,
and this can be both narrow or wide, depending on
what semantic relations the word space model is
intended to capture. The size of the context win-
dow can have large impact on the results (Sahlgren
et al., 2008), and for detecting paradigmatic re-
lations (i.e. words that occur in similar contexts,
rather than words that occur together) a fairly nar-
row context window has been shown to be most
effective.
The resulting context vectors form a matrix of
dimension w×d. This matrix is an approximation
of the term-by-term matrix, and the same similar-

A hypothetical word space with d=2 is shown in
Figure 5.
4.4 Clustering
As mentioned earlier, for the word space informa-
tion to be useful for training a CRF model on a
small data set, it must be represented as a feature
that can only take a limited number of different
values. The proposed methods for achieving this
is to cluster the context vectors of the word space
model, similar to what has been done in previous
research (Pyysalo et al., 2014). Also similar to
previous research, cluster membership for a word
in the NER training and test data will be used as a
feature. Four named hypothetical clusters of con-
text vectors are shown in the word space model
in Figure 5 to illustrate the general idea, and an
example of how to use cluster membership as a
feature is shown Figure 1.
Different clustering techniques will be evalu-
ated, for the quality of the created clusters, as well
as for their computational efficiency. Having hi-
erarchical clusters might be preferable, as clus-
ter membership to clusters of different granular-
ity then can be offered as features for training the
CRF model. Which granularity that is most suit-
able might vary depending on the entity type and
also depending on the size of the training data.
However, e.g. performing hierarchical agglomera-
tive clustering (Jurafsky and Martin, 2008, p. 700)
on the entire unlabelled corpus might be computa-
tionally intractable (thereby defeating the purpose
of using random indexing), as it requires pairwise
comparisons between the words in the corpus. The
pairwise comparison is a part of the agglomera-
tive clustering algorithm, in which each word is
first assigned its own cluster and then each pair of
clusters is compared for similarity, resulting in a
merge of the most similar clusters. This process
is thereafter iteratively repeated, having the dis-
tance between the centroids of the clusters as sim-
ilarity measure. An alternative, which requires a
less efficient clustering algorithm, would be to not
create clusters of all the words in the corpus, but
to limit initially created clusters to include those
words that occur in available terminologies. Clus-
ter membership of unknown words in the corpus
could then be determined by measuring similarity
to the centroids of these initially created clusters.
Regardless of what clustering technique that is
chosen, the parameters of the random indexing
models, as well as of the clustering, will be deter-
mined by evaluating to what extent words that be-
long to one of the studied semantic categories (ac-
cording to available terminologies) are clustered
together. This will be measured using purity and
inverse purity (Amig´o et al., 2009). However, if
clusters are to be created from all words in the cor-
pus, the true semantic category will only be known
for a very small subset of clustered words. In that
case, the two measures have to be defined as purity
being to what extent a cluster only contains known
words of one category and inverse purity being the
extent to which known words of the same category
are grouped into the same cluster.

5 Proposed experiments
The first phase of the experiments will consist of
finding the best parameters for the random index-
ing model and the clustering, as described above.
The second phase will consist of evaluating the
usefulness of the clustered data for the NER task.
Three main experiments will be carried out in this
phase (I, II and III), using data set(s) from the fol-
lowing sources:
I: Internal medicine ER
II: Internal medicine ER + Cardiac ICU
III: Internal medicine ER + Orthopaedic ER
In each experiment, the following will be car-
ried out:
1. Divide internal medicine ER training data
into 5 partitions (into a random division, to
better simulate the situation when not all data
is available, using the same random division
for all experiments).
2. Run step 3-5 in 5 rounds. Each new round
uses one additional internal medicine ER par-
tition: (Experiments II and III always use the
entire data set from the other domain). In
each round, two versions of step 3-5 will be
carried out:
(a) With unsupervised features.
(b) Without unsupervised features.
3. Use training data for determining C-value (by
n-fold cross-validation).
4. Use training data for training a model with
this C-value.
5. Evaluate the model on the held-out internal
medicine ICU data.
6 Open issues
What clustering technique to use has previously
been mentioned as one important open issue. The
following are examples of other open issues:
• Could the information obtained from random
indexing be used in some other way than as
transformed to cluster membership features?
Jonnalagadda et al. (2012) used the terms
closest in the semantic space as a feature.
Could this method be adapted in some way
to models constructed with a small amount
of training data? For instance by restricting
what terms are allowed to be used as such a
feature, and thereby limiting the number of
possible values this feature can take.
• Would it be better to use other approaches (or
compare different approaches) for obtaining
features from unlabelled data? A possibil-
ity could be to use a more standard cluster-
ing approach, such as Brown clustering used
in previous clinical NER studies (de Bruijn
et al., 2011). Another possibility could be to
keep the idea of creating clusters from vec-
tors in a word space model, but to use other
methods than random indexing for construct-
ing the word space; e.g. the previously men-
tioned latent semantic analysis (Landauer and
Dutnais, 1997), or a neural networks-based
word space implementation (Pyysalo et al.,
2014).
• Many relevant terms within the medical do-
main are multi-word terms (e.g. of the type
diabetes mellitus), and there are studies on
how to construct semantic spaces with such
multiword terms as the smallest semantic
unit (Henriksson et al., 2013). Should the
whitespace segmented token be treated as the
smallest semantic unit in the proposed study,
or should the use of larger semantic units be
considered?
