Abstract
This paper proposes to apply the contin-
uous vector representations of words for
discovering keywords from a financial sen-
timent lexicon. In order to capture more
keywords, we also incorporate syntactic
information into the Continuous Bag-of-
Words (CBOW) model. Experimental re-
sults on a task of financial risk prediction
using the discovered keywords demonstrate
that the proposed approach is good at pre-
dicting financial risk.
1 Introduction
In the present environment with a great deal of
information, how to discover useful insights for
decision making is becoming increasingly impor-
tant. In finance, there are typically two kinds of
information (Petersen, 2004): soft information usu-
ally refers to text, including opinions, ideas, and
market commentary, whereas hard information is
recorded as numbers, such as financial measures
and historical prices. Most financial studies related
to risk analysis are based on hard information, es-
pecially on time series modeling (Christoffersen
and Diebold, 2000; Lee and Tong, 2011; Wu et al.,
2014; Y¨uml¨u et al., 2005). Despite of using only
hard information, some literature incorporates soft
textual information to predict financial risk (Ko-
gan et al., 2009; Leidner and Schilder, 2010; Tsai
and Wang, 2013). Moreover, sentiment analysis, a
technique to make an assessment of the sentiments
expressed in various information, has also been
applied to analyze the soft textual information in
financial news, reports, and social media data (De-
vitt and Ahmad, 2007; Loughran and McDonald,
2011; Wang et al., 2013).
Continuous vector space models (Bengio et
al., 2003; Schwenk, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010)
are neural network language models, in which
words are represented as high dimensional real val-
ued vectors. These representations have recently
demonstrated promising results across variety of
tasks (Schwenk, 2007; Collobert and Weston, 2008;
Glorot et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2011; Weston et
al., 2011), because of their superiority of capturing
syntactic and semantic regularities in language. In
this paper, we apply the Continuous Bag-of-Words
(CBOW) model (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the soft
textual information in financial reports for discov-
ering keywords via financial sentiments. In spe-
cific, we use the continuous vector representations
of words to find out similar terms based on their
contexts. Additionally, we propose a straightfor-
ward approach to incorporate syntactic information
into the CBOW model for better locating similarly
meaningful or highly correlated words. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorpo-
rate more syntactic information by adding Part-Of-
Speech (POS) tags to the words before training the
CBOW model.
In our experiments, the corpora are the annual
SEC
1
-mandated financial reports, and there are
3,911 financial sentiment keywords for expansion.
In order to verify the effectiveness of the expanded
keywords, we then conduct two prediction tasks,
including regression and ranking. Observed from
our experimental results, for the regression and
ranking tasks, the models trained on the expanded
keywords are consistently better than those trained
the original sentiment keywords only. In addition,
for comparison, we conduct experiments with ran-
dom keyword expansion as baselines. According
to the experimental results, the expansion either
with or without syntactic information outperforms
the baselines. The results suggest that the CBOW
model is effective at expanding keywords for finan-
cial risk prediction.

2 Keyword Expansion via Financial
Sentiment Lexicon
2.1 Financial Sentiment Lexicon
A sentiment lexicon is the most important resource
for sentiment analysis. Loughran and McDon-
ald (2011) states that a general purpose sentiment
lexicon (e.g., the Harvard Psychosociological Dic-
tionary) might misclassify common words in fi-
nancial texts. Therefore, in this paper, we use a
finance-specific lexicon that consists of the 6 word
lists provided by (Loughran and McDonald, 2011)
as seeds to expand keywords. The six lists are nega-
tive (Fin-Neg), positive (Fin-Pos), uncertainty (Fin-
Unc), litigious (Fin-Lit), strong modal words (MW-
Strong), and weak modal words (MW-Weak).
2
2.2 Simple Keyword Expansion
With the financial sentiment lexicon, we first use a
collection of financial reports as the training texts
to learn continuous vector representations of words.
Then, each word in the sentiment lexicon is used as
a seed to obtain the words with the highest n cosine
distances (called the top-n words for the word) via
the learned word vector representations. Finally,
we construct an expanded keyword list from the
top-n words for each word.
2.3 Keyword Expansion with Syntactic
Information
For the expansion considering syntactic informa-
tion, we attach the POS tag to each word in the
training texts first. Then, the words in the senti-
ment lexicon with 4 major POS tags (i.e., JJ, NN,
VB, RB) are used as seeds to expand. The rest of
steps is similar to that in Section 2.2.
The reason of considering POS tags for expan-
sion is that, in general, a word with different POS
tags may result in different lists of top-n words. Ta-
ble 1 shows the top-5 words for the word “default”
with different POS tags (noun and adjective). Note
that none of the words in the two lists overlaps.
3 Financial Risk Prediction
3.1 The Risk Measure: Volatility
Volatility is a measure for variation of prices of a
stock over a period of time. Let S
t
be the price
of a stock at time t. Holding the stock from time
t? 1 to time t would lead to a simple return: R
t
=

Table 1: Top-5 Words for the word “default.”

? 1 (Tsay, 2005). The volatility of returns
for a stock from time t? n to t can thus be defined
as follows:
v
[t?n,t]
=
?
?
t
i=t?n

R)

, (1)
where
¯
R =

t
i=t?n
R
i
/(n + 1).
3.2 Regression Task
Given a collection of financial reports D =
{d
1
,d
2
, . . . ,d
n
}, in which each d
i
? R
p
and is
associated with a company c
i
, we aim to predict the
future risk of each company c
i
(which is character-
ized by its volatility v
i
). This prediction problem
can be defined as follows:
vˆ
i
= f(d
i
;w). (2)
The goal is to learn a p-dimensional vector w from
the training data T = {(d
i
, v
i
)|d
i
? R
p
, v
i
? R}.
In this paper, we adopt the Support Vector Regres-
sion (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) for training such
a regression model. More details about SVR can
be found in (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2001).
3.3 Ranking Task
Instead of predicting the volatility of each company
in the regression task, the ranking task aims to rank
companies according to their risk via the textual
information in their financial reports. We first split
the volatilities of company stock returns within a
year into different risk levels by the mechanism
provided in (Tsai and Wang, 2013). The risk levels
can be considered as the relative difference of risk
among the companies.
After obtaining the relative risk levels of the
companies, the ranking task can be defined as fol-
lows: Given a collection of financial reports D,
we aim to rank the companies via a ranking model
f : R
p
? R such that the rank order of the set of
companies is specified by the real value that the
1454
model f takes. Specifically, f(d
i
) > f(d
j
) means
that the model asserts that c
i
 c
j
, where c
i
 c
j
means that c
i
is ranked higher than c
j
; that is, the
company c
i
is more risky than c
j
. For this task, this
paper adopts Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2006).
4 Experiments
4.1 Dataset and Preprocessings
In the experiments, we use the 10-K corpus (Ko-
gan et al., 2009) to conduct our financial risk pre-
diction tasks. All documents and the 6 financial
sentiment word lists are stemmed by the Porter
stemmer (Porter, 1980), and some stop words are
also removed.
For financial risk prediction, the ground truth,
the twelve months after the report volatility for
each company, v
+(12)
, (which measures the future
risk for each company) can be calculated by Equa-
tion (1), where the stock prices can be obtained
from the Center for Research in Security Prices
(CRSP) US Stocks Database. In addition, to ob-
tain the relative risks among companies used in the
ranking task, we follow (Tsai and Wang, 2013) to
split the companies of each year into 5 risk levels.
4.2 Keyword Expansion
In our experiments, Section 7 (Management Dis-
cussion and Analysis) in 10-K corpus is used as
training texts for the tool (word2vec
3
) to learn the
continuous vector representations of words.
For the simple expansion (denoted as EXP-SIM
hereafter), we use the total 1,667 stemmed senti-
ment words as seeds to obtain the expanded key-
words via the learned word vector representations.
For the expansion considering syntactic informa-
tion (denoted as EXP-SYN), NLTK
4
is applied to
attach the POS tag
5
to each word in the training
texts; we attach the POS tag to a word with an un-
derscore notation (e.g., default VB). For simplicity,
we combine some POS tags to one tag via the tag
replacement; for example, the tags JJR (adjective,
comparative) and JJS (adjective, superlative) are
replaced to JJ (adjective). The detailed replace-
ment rules are tabulated in Table 2. Words from
the sentiment lexicon with the four types of POS
tags (i.e., JJ, NN, VB, RB) are consider as the seeds
to expand the keywords. For both EXP-SIM and

Table 3: Top-20 (Stemmed) Words for the Word
“default.”
EXP-SYN, we use the top-20 expanded words for
each word (e.g., Table 3) to construct expanded key-
word lists. In total, for EXP-SIM, the expanded
list contains 9,282 unique words and for EXP-SYN,
the list has 13,534 unique words.
4.3 Word Features
In the experiments, the bag-of-words model is
adopted and three word features are used to repre-
sent the 10-K reports in the experiments. Given a
document d, three word features (i.e., TF, TFIDF
and LOG1P) are calculated as follows:
• TF(t,d) = TC(t,d)/|d|,
• TFIDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) × IDF(t,d) =
TC(t,d)/|d| × log(|D|/|d ? D : t ? d|),
• LOG1P = log(1 + TC(t,d)),
where TC(t,d) denotes the term count of t in d,
|d| is the length of document d, and D denotes the
set of all documents in each year.
4.4 Experimental Results
Tables 4 and 5 tabulate the experimental results of
regression and ranking, respectively, in which the
training data is composed of the financial reports
in a five-year period, and the following year is the
test data. For example, the reports from year 1996
to 2000 constitute a training data, and the learned
model is tested on the reports of year 2001.

Table 4: Performance of Regression
In the tables, SEN denotes the experiments
trained on the words from the original financial sen-
timent lexicon. Despite of the experiments trained
on EXP-SIM and EXP-SYN, we also conduct ex-
periments with random keyword expansion (called
EXP-RAN); for the comparison purpose, we keep
the number of words in the randomly expanded
word list the same as that in EXP-SYN. Note that
the randomly expanded list contains all sentiment
words and the rest of words are randomly chosen
from the vocabulary of the dataset. The columns
with label EXP-RAN denote the results averaged
from 20 randomly expanded word lists. The bold
face numbers denote the best performance among
the four word lists.
As shown in Tables 4 and 5, for both regression
and ranking tasks, the models trained on expanded
keywords (i.e., EXP-
*
) are consistently better than
those trained on the original sentiment keywords
only.
6
Additionally, we treat the experiments with
randomly expanded word list (EXP-RAN) as the
baselines.
7
From the two tables, we observe that
the expansion either with or without syntactic in-
formation outperforms the baselines. Note that, for
the EXP-SIM, the number of words used for train-
6
Due to the page limits, only the results trained on features
LOGP for regression and TFIDF for ranking are reported, but
the performance for models trained on features TF, TFIFG,
and LOGP is very consistent.
7
The results for EXP-SYN are all significant better than
the baseline with p < 0.05.
ing the regression and ranking models is even less
than that of EXP-RAN. The results suggest that the
CBOW model is effective at expanding keywords
for financial risk prediction. Furthermore, incorpo-
rating syntactic information into the CBOW model
can even enhance the performance for the tasks of
financial risk prediction.
4.5 Discussions
Below we provide the original texts from 10-K re-
ports that contain the top 1 expanded word, “uncur”
(stemmed), for “default” in Table 3. Two pieces
of sentences are listed as follows (the company
Investment Technology Group, 1997):
· · · terminate the agreement upon cer-
tain events of bankruptcy or insolvency
or upon an uncured breach by the Com-
pany of certain covenants · · ·
· · · any termination of the license agree-
ment resulting from an uncured default
would have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s results of operations.
From the above examples, the expanded word “un-
cur” has similar meaning to “default,” which con-
firms the capability of our method of capturing
similarly meaningful or highly correlated words.
5 Conclusions
This paper applies the continuous bag-of-words
model on the textual information in financial re-
ports for expanding keywords from a financial sen-
timent lexicon. Additionally, we propose a simple
but novel approach to incorporate syntactic infor-
mation into the continuous bag-of-words model for
capturing more similarly meaningful or highly cor-
related keywords. The experimental results for the
risk prediction problem show that the expansion
either with or without syntactic information out-
performs the baselines. As a direction for further
1456
research, it is interesting and important to provide
more analysis on the expanded words via the con-
tinuous vector representations of words.
