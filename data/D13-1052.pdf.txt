Abstract
Machine translation benefits from system
combination. We propose flexible interaction
of hypergraphs as a novel technique combin-
ing different translation models within one de-
coder. We introduce features controlling the
interactions between the two systems and ex-
plore three interaction schemes of hiero and
forest-to-string models—specification, gener-
alization, and interchange. The experiments
are carried out on large training data with
strong baselines utilizing rich sets of dense
and sparse features. All three schemes signif-
icantly improve results of any single system
on four testsets. We find that specification—a
more constrained scheme that almost entirely
uses forest-to-string rules, but optionally uses
hiero rules for shorter spans—comes out as
the strongest, yielding improvement up to 0.9
(Ter-Bleu)/2 points. We also provide a de-
tailed experimental and qualitative analysis of
the results.
1 Introduction
Recent years have witnessed the success of var-
ious statistical machine translation (SMT) mod-
els using different levels of linguistic knowledge–
phrase (Koehn et al., 2003), hiero (Chiang, 2005),
and syntax-based (Liu et al., 2006; Galley et al.,
2006). System combination became a promising
way of building up synergy from different SMT sys-
tems and their specific merits.
Numerous efforts that have been proposed in this
field recently can be broadly divided into two cat-
?M. C? and H. M. contributed equally to this work.
egories: Offline system combination (Rosti et al.,
2007; He et al., 2008; Watanabe and Sumita, 2011;
Denero et al., 2010) aims at producing consensus
translations from the outputs of multiple individ-
ual systems. Those outputs usually contain k-best
lists of translations, which only explore a small por-
tion of the entire search space of each system. This
issue is well addressed in joint decoding (Liu et
al., 2009), or online system combination, showing
comparable improvements to the offline combina-
tion methods. Rather than finding consensus trans-
lations from the outputs of individual systems, joint
decoding works with different grammars at the de-
coding time. Although limited to individual systems
sharing the same search paradigm (e.g. left-to-right
or bottom-up), joint decoding offers many poten-
tial advatages: search through a larger space, bet-
ter efficiency, features designed once for all subsys-
tems, potential cross-system features, online sharing
of partial hypotheses, and many others.
Different approaches have different strengths in
general–hiero rules are believed to provide reliable
lexical coverage, while tree-to-string rules are good
at non-local reorderings. Different contexts present
different challenges–noun phrases usually follow
the adjacency principle, while verb phrases require
more challenging reorderings. In this work, we study
different schemes of interaction between translation
models, reflecting their specific strengths at differ-
ent (syntactic) contexts. We make five new contribu-
tions:
First, we propose a framework for joint decod-
ing by means of flexible combination of trans-
lation hypergraphs, allowing for detailed con-
545
trol of interactions between the different sys-
tems using soft constraints (Section 3).
Second, we study three interaction schemes–
special cases of joint decoding: generalization,
specification, and interchange (Section 3.3).
Third, instead of using a tree-to-string system,
we use a much stronger forest-to-string sys-
temwith fuzzy match of nonterminal categories
(Section 2.1).
Fourth, we train strong systems on a large-
scale data set, and test all methods on four test
sets. Experimental results (Section 6) show that
our new approach brings improvement of up to
0.9 points in terms of (Ter ? Bleu)/2 over the
best single system.
Fifth, we conduct a comprehensive experimen-
tal analysis, and find that joint decoding actu-
ally prefers tree-to-string rules in both shorter
and longer spans. (Section 6.3).
The paper is organized as follows: We briefly re-
view the individual models in Section 2, describe
the method of joint decoding using three alternative
interaction schemes in Section 3, describe the fea-
tures controlling the interactions and fuzzy match in
Section 4, review the related work in Section 5, and
finally, describe our experiments and give detailed
discussion of the results in Section 6.
2 Individual Models
Our individual models are two state-of-the-art sys-
tems: a hiero model (Chiang, 2005), and a forest-to-
string model (Mi et al., 2008; Mi and Huang, 2008).
We will use the following example from Chinese
to English to explain both individual and joint de-
coding algorithms throughout this paper.

Table 1 shows translation rules that can generate
all four translations. We will use those rules in the
following sections.
2.1 Forest-to-string
Forest-to-string translation (Mi et al., 2008) is a lin-
guistic syntax-based system, which significantly im-
proves the translation quality of the tree-to-string
model (Liu et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006) by using
a packed parse forest as the input instead of a single
parse tree.
Figure 1 shows a tree-to-string translation
rule (Huang et al., 2006), which is a tuple
?lhs(r), rhs(r), ?(r)?, where lhs(r) is the source-side
tree fragment, whose internal nodes are labeled by
nonterminal symbols (like NP and VP), and whose
frontier nodes are labeled by source-language words
(like “hu`i”) or variables from a set X = {x1, x2, . . .};
rhs(r) is the target-side string expressed in target-
language words (like “going”) and variables; and
?(r) is a mapping from X to nonterminals. Each

the 1-best parse. (b) The corresponding translation forest F t after applying the tree-to-string translation rule set Rt.
Target lexical content is not shown. Each translation hyperedge (e.g. e7) has the same index as the corresponding rule
(r7). Gray nodes (e.g. VP1,3) became inaccessible due to the insufficient rule coverage. (b?) The translation forest Fh
after applying the hierarchical rule set Rh to the input sentence. (c) The combined translation forest Hm obtained by
superimposing b and b?. The nodes within each solid box share the same span. See Figure 3 for an example of the
internal structure of a box. The forest-to-string system can produce the translation 1 (dashed derivation: r2, r4 and r7)
and 2 (solid derivation: r1, r3, r?4, r5, and r6). Hierarchical rules generate the translation 3 (r11 and r13). The translation
4 is available by using joint decoding at X1, 3 ? IP1, 3 with the derivation: r1, r6, r12, and r14.
variable xi ? X occurs exactly once in lhs(r) and
exactly once in rhs(r). Take the rule r7 in Figure 1
for example, we have:
lhs(r7) = IP(x1:NP VP(VV(hu`i) x2:VP)),
rhs(r7) = x2 is x1 going,
?(r7) = {x1 7? NP, x2 7? VP}.
Typically, a forest-to-string system performs
translation in two steps (shown in Figure 2): pars-
ing and decoding. In the parsing step, we convert the
source language input into a parse forest (a). In the
decoding step, we first convert the parse forest into a
translation forest Ft in (b) by using the fast pattern-
matching technique (Zhang et al., 2009). For exam-
ple, we pattern-match the rule r7 rooted at IP0, 3, in
such a way that x1 spans NP0, 1 and x2 spans VP2, 3,
and add a translation hyperedge e7 in (b). Then the
decoder searches for the best derivation on the trans-
lation forest and outputs the target string.
2.2 Hiero
Hiero (hierarchical phrase-based) model (Chiang,
2005) acquires rules of synchronous context-free
grammars (SCFGs) from word-aligned parallel data,
and uses plain sequences of words as the input, with-
out any syntactic information.

Figure 3: Three interaction schemes for joint decoding.
Details of the interaction supernode for span (1, 3) shown
in Figure 2 (c). Soft constraints control the transitions.
SCFG can be formalized as a set of tuples
?lhs(r), rhs(r), ?(r)?, where lhs(r) is the source-side
one-level CFG, whose root is X or S, and whose
frontier nodes are labeled by source-language words
(like “hu`i”) or variables from a set X = {x1, x2, . . .};
rhs(r) is the target-side string expressed in target-
language words (like “going”) and variables; and
?(r) is a mapping from X to nonterminals. Table 1
shows examples of hiero rules r11–r15.
Although different on source side, hiero decod-
ing can be formalized equally as forest-to-string de-
coding: First, pattern-match the input sentence into
a translation forest Fh. For example, since the rule
r11 matches “ze?nmeya`ng” such that x1 spans the first
two words, add a hyperedge e11 in Figure 2 (b?).
Then search for the best derivation over the trans-
lation forest.
3 Joint Decoding
The goal of joint decoding is to let different MT
models collaborate within the framework of a single
decoder. This can be done by combining translation
hypergraphs of the different models at the decod-
ing time, so that online sharing of partial hypotheses
overcomes weaknesses and boosts strengths of the
systems combined.
As both forest-to-string and hiero produce trans-
lation forests that share the same hypergraph struc-
ture, we first formalize the hypergraph, then we in-
troduce an algorithm to combine different hyper-
graphs, and finally we describe three joint decoding
schemes over the merged hypergraph.
3.1 Hypergraphs
More formally, a hypergraph H is a pair ?V, E?,
where V is the set of nodes, and E the set of hyper-
edges. For a given sentence w1:l = w1 . . .wl, each
node v ? V is in the form of Y i, j, where Y is a
nonterminal in the context-free grammar1 and i, j,
0 ? i < j ? l, are string positions in the sentence
w1:l, which denote the recognition of nonterminal
Y spanning the substring from positions i through j
(that is, wi+1 . . .w j). Each hyperedge e ? E is a tuple
?tails(e), head(e), target(e)?, where head(e) ? V is
the consequent node in the deductive step, tails(e) ?
V? is the list of antecedent nodes, and target(e) is
a list of rhs(r) for rules r such that each rule r has
the same lhs(r) pattern-matched at the node head(e).
For example, the hyperedge e7 in Figure 2 (b) is
e7 = ?(NP0, 1,VP2, 3), IP0, 3, (x2 is x1 going)?,
where we can infer the mapping to be
{x1 7? NP0, 1, x2 7? VP2, 3 }.
We also denote BS(v) to be the set of incoming
hyperedges of node v, which represent the different
ways of deriving v. For example, BS(IP0, 3) is a set
of e7 and e6.
There is also a distinguished root node TOP in
each hypergraph, denoting the goal item in transla-
tion, which is simply TOP0, l.
3.2 Combining Hypergraphs
We enable interaction between translation hyper-
graphs, such as hiero Fh = ?Vh, Eh? and forest-to-
string Ft = ?V t, Et?, on nodes covering the same
span (e.g. IP1, 3 and X1, 3 in Figure 2 (c) grouped in
a box). We call such groups interaction supernodes
and show a detailed example of a supernode for span
(1, 3) in Figure 3.
The combination runs in four steps:
1In this paper, nonterminal labels X and S denote hiero
derivations, other labels are tree-to-string labels.
548
1. For each node v = Y i, j, v ? Vh ? V t, we create
a new interaction node v? = Y ?i, j with empty
BS (v?). For example, we create two nodes,
IP?1, 3 and X?1, 3, at the top of Figure 3.
2. For each hyperedge e ? BS(v), v ? V t ? Vh,
we replace each v in tails(e) with v?. For exam-
ple, e7 becomes ?(NP?0, 1,VP?2, 3), IP0, 3, (x2 is
x1 going)?.
3. All the nodes and hyperedges form the merged
hypergraph Fm, such as in Figure 2 (c).
4. Insert interaction hyperedges connecting nodes
within each interaction supernode to make Fm
connected again.
In the following subsection we present details of in-
teractions and introduce three alternative schemes.
3.3 Three Schemes of Joint Decoding
Interaction hyperedges within each supernode allow
the decoder either to stay within the same system
(e.g. in hiero using X1, 3 ? X?1, 3 in Figure 3), or to
switch to the other (e.g. to forest-to-string using X1, 3
? IP?1, 3).
For example, translation 4 can be produced as
follows: The source string “ze?nmeya`ng” is trans-
lated by the phrase rule r12. The hiero hyperedge
e14 combines it with the translation of “hu`i”, reach-
ing the hiero node X1, 3. Using the interaction edge
X1, 3 ? IP?1, 3 will switch into the tree-to-string
model, so that the translation can be completed with
the tree-to-string edge e6 that connects it with a par-
tial tree-to string translation of “ta?olu`n” done by r1.
In order to achieve more precise control over the
interaction between tree-to-string and hiero deriva-
tions, we propose the following three basic inter-
action schemes: generalization, specification, in-
terchange. The schemes control the interaction be-
tween hiero and tree-to-string models by means of
soft constraints. Some schemes may even restrict
certain types of transitions. The schemes are de-
picted in Figure 3 and their details are discussed in
the following three subsections.
3.3.1 Specification
The specification decoding scheme reflects the in-
tuition of using hiero rules to translate shorter spans
and tree-to-string rules to reorder higher-level sen-
tence structures. In other words, the scheme allows
one-way switching from the hiero general nontermi-
nal into the more specific nonterminal of a tree-to-
string rule. Transitions in reverse directions are not
allowed. This is achieved by inserting specification
interaction hyperedges e leading from hiero nodes
Xi, j or Si, j into all tree-to-string interaction nodes
Y?i, j within the same supernode.
3.3.2 Generalization
In some translation domains, hiero outperforms
tree-to-string systems, as was shown in experiments
in Section 6. While local hiero or tree-to-string re-
orderings perform well, long distance reorderings
proposed by tree-to-string may be too risky (e.g. due
to parsing errors), so that monotone concatenation
of long sequences2 is the more reliable strategy. The
generalization decoding scheme, complementary to
the specification, is motivated by the idea of incorpo-
rating reliable tree-to-string translations for some se-
quences into a strong hiero translation system. This
is achieved by inserting generalization interaction
hyperedges e leading from tree-to-string nodes Yi, j
nodes into general hiero interaction nodes X?i, j and
S?i, j within the same supernode.
3.3.3 Interchange
The interchange decoding scheme is a union of
the two previous approaches. Any derivation can
freely combine hiero and tree-to-string productions.
Both specification and generalization interaction
hyperedges are inserted leading from all hiero and
tree-to-string nodes Xi, j, Si, j, and Yi, j into all inter-
action nodes X?i, j, S?i, j, and Y?i, j.
3.4 Fuzzy match
The translation rule set cannot usually cover all
hyperedges in the parse forest, thus some nodes
become inaccessible in the translation forest (e.g.
VP1, 3 in Figure 2). However, in the parse forest, as
opposed to a 1-best tree, we can find other nodes
spanning the same sequence wi: j (e.g. node IP1, 3).
In order to re-enable inaccessible nodes and to in-
crease the variability of the translation forest, we
allow reaching them from the other tree-to-string
2Monotone glue is the only possibility for very long spans
exceeding the hiero maxParse treshold.
549
nodes within the same interaction node. This can
be achieved by adding fuzzy hyperedges between
every tree-to-string state Y i, j and a differently la-
beled tree-to-string interaction state Z?i, j. For exam-
ple, in the span (0,1), we have a fuzzy hyperedge
VV0, 1 ? NP?0, 1.
While interaction hyperedges combine different
translation models, fuzzy hyperedges combine dif-
ferent derivations within the same (tree-to-string)
model.
4 Interaction Features
Our baseline systems use the log-linear framework
to estimate the probability P(D) of a derivation D
from features ?i and their weights ?i as P(D) ?
exp
(?
i ?i?i
)
. Similarly as Chiang et al. (2009), our
systems use tens of dense (e.g. language models,
translation probabilities) and thousands of sparse
(e.g. lexical, fertility) features.
The features related to the joint decoding experi-
ments are the costs for specification, generalization,
interchange, and the fuzzy match. Let Lt be the set
of the labels used by the source language parser and
Lh = {S,X} be the labels used by hiero.
The generalization feature
?Y?Z = |{e; e ? D,?i, j tails(e) = {Yi, j} (1)
?head(e) = Z?i, j}|
is the total number of generalization hyperedges in
D going from tree-to-string states Y ? Lt to hiero
states Z? ? Lh.
The specification feature
?Z?Y = |{e; e ? D,?i, j tails(e) = {Zi, j} (2)
?head(e) = Y?i, j}|
is the total number of specification hyperedges in D
going from hiero states Z ? Lh to tree-to-string states
Y ? ? Lt.
The interchange feature is implemented by en-
abling the generalization and specification features
at the same time for both tuning and testing.
The fuzzy match feature
?U?W = |{e; e ? D,?i, j tails(e) = {Ui, j} (3)
?head(e) = W?i, j}|
is the total number of fuzzy match hyperedges in D
going from tree-to-tree statesU ? Lt to tree-to-string
states W? ? Lt. 3
We use MIRA to obtain weights for the new fea-
tures by tuning on the development set. The num-
ber of new parameters to tune can be estimated as
|Lh| × |Lt| for generalization and specification, and
2 × |Lh| × |Lt| for interchange. For the fuzzy match
of tree-to-string nonterminals we have |Lt| × |Lt| pa-
rameters organized as a sparse matrix, since we only
consider combinations on nonterminal labels that
cooccur in the data.4
5 Related Work
From the previous explorations of online translation
model combination, we see the work of Liu et al.
(2009) proposing an unconstrained combination of
hiero and tree-to-string models as a special configu-
ration of our framework, and we also replicate it.
Denero et al. (2010) combine translation mod-
els even with different search paradigms. Their ap-
proach is different, since their component systems
do not interact at decoding time, instead, each of
them provides its weighted translation forest first,
the forests are then combined to infer a new com-
bination model.
6 Experiment
In this section we describe the setup, present results,
and analyze the experiments. Finally, we propose fu-
ture directions of research.
3Here we allow U = W, which can be viewed in such a way
that exact match is a special case of fuzzy match.
4We also carried out an alternative experiment with only
three fuzzy match features estimated from the training data
parse forest by Na?¨ve Bayes by observing all spans in the train-
ing data, accumulating counts Cs(U) and Cs(U,W) of nonter-
minals (or pairs of nonterminals) heading the same span s. The
first two features (one for each direction) are based on condi-
tional probabilities:
?(U |W) = ? log
(
?
s?spans Cs (U,W)
?
s?spans Cs(W)
)
. (4)
The third feature is based on joint probability:
?(U,W) = ? log
(
?
s?spans Cs(U,W)
?
s?spans,A,B?Lt Cs(A, B)
)
. (5)
The average performance drops by 0.1 (Ter-Bleu)/2 points,
compared to the interchange eperiment.

6.1 Setup
The training corpus consists of 16 million sen-
tence pairs available within the DARPA BOLT
Chinese-English task. The corpus includes a mix
of newswire, broadcast news, webblog and comes
from various sources such as LDC, HK Law, HK
Hansard and UN data. The Chinese text is seg-
mented with a segmenter trained on CTB data using
conditional random fields (CRF). Language models
are trained on the English side of the parallel cor-
pus, and on monolingual corpora, such as Gigaword
(LDC2011T07) and Google News, altogether com-
prising around 10 billion words.
We use a modified version of the Berkeley parser
(Petrov and Klein, 2007) to obtain a parse forest
for each training sentence, then we prune it with
the marginal probability-based inside-outside algo-
rithm to contain only 3n CFG nodes, where n is the
sentence length. Finally, we apply the forest-based
GHKM algorithm (Mi and Huang, 2008; Galley et
al., 2004) to extract tree-to-string translation rules
from forest-string pairs.
In the decoding step, we prune the input hyper-
graphs to 10n nodes before we use fast pattern-
matching (Zhang et al., 2009) to convert the parse
forest into the translation forest.
We tune on 1275 sentences, each with 4 refer-
ences, from the LDC2010E30 corpus, initially re-
leased under the DARPA GALE program.
All MT experiments are optimized with
MIRA (Crammer et al., 2006) to maximize
(Ter-Bleu)/2.
We test on four different test sets: GALE-web test
set from LDC2010E30 corpus (1239 sentences, 4
references), P1R6-web test set from LDC2012E124
corpus (1124 sentences, 1 reference), NIST MT08
newswire portion (691 sentences, 4 references), and
NIST MT08 web portion (666 sentences, 4 refer-
ences).
6.2 Results
Table 2 shows all results of single and joint decoding
systems. The Bleu score of the single hiero baseline
is 39.2 on MT08-news, showing that it is a strong
system. The single F2S baseline achieves compara-
ble scores on all four test sets.
Then, for reference, we present results of joint Hi-
ero and T2S decoding, which is, to our knowledge, a
strong and competitive reimplementaion of the work
described by Liu et al. (2009). Finally, we present re-
sults of joint decoding of hiero and F2S in three in-
teraction schemes: generalization, specification, and
interchange.
All three combination schemes significantly im-
prove results of any single system on all four test-
sets. On average and measured in (Ter-Bleu)/2,
our systems improve the best single system by 0.4
(generalization), 0.7 (specification), and 0.6 (inter-
change).
The specification comes out as the strongest inter-
action scheme, beating the second interchange on 2
testsets by 0.1 and 0.4 (Ter-Bleu)/2 points and on 3
testsets by 0.2 Bleu points.
6.3 Discussion of Results
Interpretations of model behavior with thousands of
parameters that may possibly overlap and interfere
should be always attempted with caution. In this sec-
tion we highlight some interesting observations, ac-

use them).
The most expensive interactions for the specifi-
cation belong to constituents (IP, VP) that usually
occur higher in a syntactic tree (see Figure 4 for av-
erage span lengths of selected syntactic labels), and
often require non-local reorderings. This indicates
that the decoder is discouraged from switching from
hiero into F2S derivation at these higher-level spans.

Figure 5: Rule distributions on GALE-web test set.
The third most expensive feature belongs to a
part-of-speech tag—the preterminal VV. We may
hypothesize that it shows the importance of lexical
information for the precision of reordering typically
carried out within (parent) VP nodes, and/or the im-
portance of POS information for succesful disam-
biguation of word senses in translation. Ideally, the
system can use a VP rule with a lexicalized VV. Less
preferably, the VV part has to be translated by an-
other T2S rule (losing the lexical constraint). In the
worst case, the system has to use a hiero hypothe-
sis to translate the VV part (losing the syntactic con-
straint), risking imprecise translation, since the hiero
rule is not constrained to senses corresponding to the
source POS VV. Again, the high penalty discourages
from using the hiero derivation in this context.
On the other hand, the bottom of the table shows
labels that encourage using hiero–DP, PP, DNP,
ADJP, etc.–shorter phrases that tend to be monotone
and less ambiguous.
Similar interpretations seem plausible when ex-
amining the generalization experiment. Expensive
features related to preterminals (NR, NN, CD) may
suggest two alternative principles: First, using F2S
rules for thes POS categories and then switching to
hiero is discouraged, since these contexts are more
reliably handled by hiero due to better lexical cover-
age and common adjacency in nominal categories.
Second, since there is only one attempt to switch
from F2S derivation to hiero, letting F2S complete
even larger spans (and maybe switching to hiero
later) is favorable.
The tail of generalization feature weights is more
difficult to interpret. The discount on VP encourages
decoder to use F2S for entire verb phrases before
switching to hiero, on the other hand, other verb-
related preterminals occupy the tail as well, hurrying
into early switching from F2S to hiero.
553
Finally, the feature weights tuned for the in-
terchange experiment are divided into two sub-
columns. Both generalization and specification
weights show similar trends as in the previous two
interaction schemes, although blurred (VP and IP
descending from the absolute top). Since transitions
in both ways are allowed, the search space is big-
ger and the system may behave differently. It is even
possible for a path in the hypergraph to zigzag be-
tween F2S and hiero nodes to collect interaction dis-
counts, “diluting” the syntactic homogeneity of the
hypothesis.
Figure 5 and Tables 4 and 5 show rule distribu-
tions, total rule counts, and numbers of interactions
of different types for the three interaction schemes
on the GALE-web test set. The scope of phrase rules
is limited to 6 words. The scope of hiero rules is lim-
ited to 20 words by the commonly used maxParse
parameter, leaving longer spans to the glue rule.
The trends of F2S and glue rules show the most
obvious difference. In the generalization, F2S rules
translate spans of up to 50 words. Glue rules pre-
vail on spans longer then 7 words. The specification
is reversed, pushing the longest scope of hiero and
glue rules down to 40 words, completing the longest
sentences entirely with F2S. The interchange comes
out as a mixture of the previous two trends.
All three schemes prefer using F2S rules at
shorter spans, to the contrary of our original assump-
tion of phrasal and hiero rules being stronger on lo-
cal contexts in general. Here we may refer again
to the specification feature weights for preterminals
VV, NR, CC and P in Table 3 and to our previously
stated hypothesis about the importance of preserving
lexical and syntactic context.
Hiero rules usage on longer spans drops fastest
for specification, slowest for generalization, and in
between for interchange.
It is also interesting to notice the trends on very
short spans (2–4 words) shown by rule distributions
and reflected in numbers of interaction types. While
specification often transitions from a single phrase
rule directly into F2S, the interchange has relatively
higher counts of hiero rules, another sign of the hiero
and F2S interaction.
Synthesizing from several sources of indications
is difficult, however, we arrive at the conclusion that
joint decoding of hiero and F2S significantly im-
proves the performance. While the single systems
show similar performance, their roles are not bal-
anced in joint decoding. It seems that the role of hi-
ero consists in enabling F2S in most contexts.
We have focused on three special cases of inter-
action. We see a great potential in further studies
of other schemes, allowing more flexible interaction
than simple specification, but still more constrained
than the interchange. It seems also promising to re-
fine the interaction modeling with features taking
into account more information than a single syntac-
tic label, and to explore additional ways of parame-
ter estimation.
7 Conclusion
We have proposed flexible interaction of hyper-
graphs as a novel technique combining hiero
and forest-to-string translation models within one
decoder. We have explored three basic interac-
tion schemes—specification, generalization, and
interchange—and described soft constraints control-
ling the interactions. We have carried out experi-
ments on large training data and with strong base-
lines. Of the three schemes, the specification shows
the highest gains, achieving improvements from 0.5
to 0.9 (Ter-Bleu)/2 points over the best single sys-
tem. We have conducted a detailed analysis of each
system output based on different indications of inter-
actions, discussed possible interpretations of results,
and finally offered our conclusion and proposed fu-
ture lines of research.
