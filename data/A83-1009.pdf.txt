ABSTRACT 
A major problem In automatically anaiy~dng the text  o f  
m~lltary messaq;les In m~lar to synthesize data b~le  e le-  
ments is separating fact  from opinion, I.e., Ident~n9 
factual statements versus evaluat ive commentary such 
4,; degree Of bel ief or confidence In the parameters o f  s 
particular event, comparative evaiual~ons of  entit les and 
events, predictions of  future events,  etc. This paper  
desmlbes a m~iel which accmmta for  the range of  fac -  
tual to evaluative Information In the message traff ic,  and 
dlocusses a means for repreaenUng such Ioformation In

1.0 EIACI~GFIOUND 
For several  years, with some Inl;erroptlone, a research 
end development e f for t  ha l  been In procmm In the 
Operating Systems Division of  Logicon (and its prede-  
came'  company, OpereUng Systems, Inc.) aimed at  the 
automated creation of  data base elements from the text  
~f  electronically transmitted military messages. 1 \[Kuhna 
and Montgomery 1973, Kuhns 1Q74, Kuhns ot  ai 1975, 
SIlva end Montgomery 1977, Silva et el 1979e, 19T9b, 
Owigglns and Silva 1981.\ ]  The object ive of this 
research has been to provide an automated capabil ity to 
supplement the presently largely manuel, isbor-intermive 
task of  meintainlng the currency of  data bases which 
derive their InformaUon elements from the text  of  mili- 
tary rues=ages. Although some ef for t  has been devoted 
to primarily Interactive approaches to the problem, and 
to mwmages which have highly predictable cniumnar 
summary formats, the majority of the research and 
development work has concentrated on the more diff icult 
task of analyzing unformatted narrative l:axt with user 
Interaction limited to occasional sssistmlca to the 
automated system. 
A teethed system called MATRES has been constructed 
In Prolog to run under the UNiX operating system on the 
POP 11/70.  MATRES Is a knowledge based system for 
undorotanding the natural language text  of event -  
oriented massages tn the domains of air activit ies and 
space/missile (S&M) activities. The knowledge struc-  
tures In MATRES, called "templates a, are essential ly 
frames or scripts describing entit ies and events, which 
answer the military u~er's bsolc questions about these

MlenmmmL as I l lustrated In the simplified view of an 
event  template pr lmentod In Figure 1. 
The templatee are hierarchically organized; lower level 
templates deal with ot)Jects or times, mid level with 
evarlts containing objects  and times, higher level with 
activit ies composed of  events. The slots in the tam- 
plates contadn procedures which operate upon the out- 
put o f  the Definite Clause Grammar (DCG) to Instantlata 
the templatlm. 
We are currently using a corpus of  spprcximstaF/ 125 
messages In the S&M domain s~ a basis for developing a 
scenario for evaluation of  the extended MATRES 
teatl~bed, ms well ms a teethed for a related knowledge 
baaed ayltem, the Act ive/ Introspect ive information Sys-  
tem \[desCribed In Montgomery and Ruapini 1981, and 
Ruapinl 1982\ ]  for  which MATRES serves  an a front end. 
The scanmlo Involves two simulated nations, the Delta 
Col~edaratton of  the Atlantic States and the Epsilon 
Repobllk:. Both netlone have space programs, and each 
Is interested in monitoring the technological progress of 
the other, using their own satai l l te and sensor resources 
mid those of  other fr iendly neUon8. The sot  of  fifes- 
sages to be analyzed by MATRES are mainly reports of  
space and satel l i te launches and orbital activit ies of the 
Delta Confederation, which are being monitored and 
evaluated by the Epsllon RepubUc. The text  o1' mes- 
sages used In the scenario has the structure and format 
of  actual messages reporting on S&M activities, although 
the lexicon is substantial ly di f ferent.  
All discumled In several  previous technical reports 
prepared under earlier contracts with RAOC (~Kuhns and 
Mantgamary 1973\] ,  \[Silva at  el 19790\] ,  \[Silva et sl 
1979b\]) ,  the subset ot' the English language on which 
the text  Of Intell igence messages 18 based Is essentisl ly 
a specialized language for reporting events. Intermixed 
with factual statements reporting on entit les and 
events, however, Is much evaluative commentary. More- 
over, proms announcements of the Oeita Confederation 
are Included In the reports, and evaluat ive comments are 
made both about the events  reported In the press 
announcements and the announcements themselves. In 
synthesizing data base elements from these messages, 
it is crucial to sort out these di f ferent  levels of informa- 
tion. 
This paper defines an approach to identifying and label- 
Ing those types of  Information so that they can be 
exploited In the context  of MATRES and the data base 
systems which It serves.

2.0 THE RESEARCH PROBLEM 
/Ul noted above, the subiengusge of  the message car-  
pore for  the air sotivitJes and S&M domains Is essential ly 
a vehicle for ~ n g  events.  Kuhns and Montgomery 
\ [1978\ ]  presented • detai led . :ethodology for  classifying 
the various types o f  events  described In the . :essages,  
which Is shown In Figure 2, and summmtzed below. 
Before describing the event  c lml f l ca t lon ,  however,  It Is 
enlightening to rev iew briefly soma example . :esaages In 
order to understand the motivation for  this rather com- 
p lex model 
Some mmsgas  w for  example, those encountered In 
our previotm research on the air act iv it ies domain - -  may 
report  only pr imit ive events.  However, as noted shove 
and IlluatTerted in Figure 3, s message may in fact  be a 
report of  • report - -  that Is, It may Include e report  o f  an 
event  by so.:e other source than the originator o f  the 
message. The "announcement m Is thus a row0rt of • 
• launch m event,  which Is the basic or prlmiUve event  
being reported. The mmnrmunoementm \],., an event,  but It 
Is c learly not on the same level as the primitive event.  
Rather, it is s report  about  the launch, s . :e ta -event  
that  Incidentally introduces s new Infatuation source of  
d i f ferent  credibil ity than the originator o f  the . :esaege. 
However, this dlsUnotJon alone Is not suf f ic ient  to 
account for the d i f ference between the Initial two sen-  
tencea of  the sxa. :p ia  message end the third sentence,  
whloh contains an evaluation of  the announce.cent, s ta t -  
Ing that  It wu  character ized by "rout ine" wording. It Is 
thus an evalueUve com.:entary on the press snrmunce- 
, :ant o f  the launch event  Since the announcement has 
been def ined am s . :e ta -event ,  the comment represents  
another mete- leveL In fact,  In reviewing additional 
example8 of  the .:emsege traf f ic  in this scenario, it Is 
clear that, In order to accurately distill and represent  
Information contained in the text  o f  these messages, the 
enalyl:lcal .:ethodo~ogy must Identify end uniquely label 
the following types  of  information:

a.o AMALYTICAL MLrrHoDQLOGY 
~mdyticaJ methodology IS baaed on • model of  the 
mW world situeth=n which underlies the scenmto. Part o f  
the modet derives from the event  c lmi f i caUon schema 
mentlmled shove, and Il lustrated in Figure 2, which was 
deveiooed to account for the levels of  content occurlng 
in the event-or iented message disooume, in this clan- 
slficetion, there are two major types  of  events, mete 
meats  and n~t -mete  event  I .  Of the letter, events may 
bo al~lorvartkNlei, Or prlmltive. An obaervetlonaJ evenf~ 
la a direct perception of  an event, which may be a visual 
percopUon (e.g., "observe",  "sightS), Or In Ute cane of  a 
sensor, an electronic measurement of  the emitted 
energy charanterizlng the event. A primlt|ve event  is 
thus a physical event  of  some kind which does not 
Involve an obaervaUon Or per~epUQn. Primitive evento 
may be at t r ibut ive Or relat loeai .  An attribuUve event  
doacriben a situation In which a particular entity hag • 
partiooiar attr ibute at a certain time or during a particu- 
lar time Interval (other than the attr ibute location, which 
Is coveted under relational events),  for example: WTer- 
rex 534 operates In the high density mode". A relational 
event Involves entit les which stand In an n-sty relation 
with oath  other st a certain Urea or during s f ixed time 
period. The Importance of the subclasses of world point 
and world point qualification event8 la in defining the 
world l i ra of sn entity, say the track cf s ship or subma- 
rine. Of these distinctions, the moat relevant for this 
discussion ere those Involving mete-events  and me-  
mete events,  and of  the latter, primiUve vef=us obaer -  
vetkmad events. 
In torero of the scenm'io described aDQve, a primitive 
ovwrt  many occur, say, • aatel l l te launch by tllo Delta 
Confederation, am Il lustrated In Figure 4. This event, like 
any other event,  Involves the emission o f  energy. Such 
in  omission 18 perceived by a sensing device of  the 
El~ilml RopubllG. The device genefetoe (down arrow) a 
report o f  the giv|m event, In terms of  the partlcuisr 
attr ibutes of  the event  It la designed to measure. This 
sefmer report  Is an obaervet lonaJ  event,  entailing an 
obaervetlml of  a primitive evonL An S&M analyst for the 
Repubilk: ancemles (up arrow) this report, which 
contains digitized Information generated by the sensor, 
I l t te f l l~to  this Information ~1 • launch event,  and Issues 
his own report  about that  event. 
HI8 re l~rt ,  which la an IntsrpretaUon of  the primitive 
event  baned on the obaervetionW event,  Is s zeroth 
m~lm. mete-event= the common denominator of  the rues- 
mlge traff ic.  At the same time, the Deltas may release 
an Internal report  about the launch, which would also 
(mnstltlxte s zeroth order mote-event.  Based on that 
apor t ,  the Delta pr im agency, NYT, may Issue an 
snnounomaent of  the primitive event,  the snnmmoemsnt 
thus e~nwUtutea s f ~ d e r  mete -event .  An Epsllon 
Republk: rq~rter  may then make an Interpretation of. 
that ennota~enent~ In the form of  a report, which 
being a report  of  4 f i rst -order mete-event  - -  Is there-  
fore m aecmtd ~ mete-event .  Corrections or other 
changes made by El=~lllon reporters to these messages 
constitute a th i rd mete level  o f  report ing event, since 
they may reference reports of  reports of events. 
The m(xlet thu l  fair accounts for  the event  reporting 
structure which undmtioa the Delta/Epsilon scenario, but 
we must slam acm~alt for  the repo~ar 's  comments about 
the event  - -  Le., his interpretation or evaluation of the 
event  - -  which can occur at any of these levels. 
The moortor~s goaJ Is to Identify and denoribe all the 
relevant parameters of  an event  (exemplif ied by the 
~ots  In the template for a launch event,  shown in the 
center of Figure 5) based on the observational report 
produced by the sensor and any other information he 
may h ive  (e.g., knowledge that a replacement of s non- 
functioning communications satel l i te is likely within a 
given time frame). However, if the reportor 's Information 
Is Incomplete or Imprecise, he cannot exactJy describe 
the parameters of  an event, but will give his best  
Interpretation of  the event  baaed on whet he knows. 
Thus he may report a launch of "an unidentified sate l -  
lite", "a probable television support satel l i te",  "s possi-  
ble CE satel l ite". In some cases, ho may have enough 
Information to make a comperaUve evaluation with launch 
events which have occurTed In the pest: "a new ESV", 
"the second CE satel l i te to be successful ly orbited by 
the Deitim this year".  SUil another type of mete Infer-

AT 1808Z ON 20 8avur.MBER 1988. THE BR02 LAUNCH SYSTEM WAS U8ED TO 
PLACI THE ~TELJJTE INTO A 3 DEGREE ORBIT. WSJ OBJECT NUMBER

However, when hi8 Informat~n Is Impremiao and hie 
Imowledge can add little to it, he must rmmrt to the 
qualified or mota-Gommented typos of  messages 
dlm(~rJbed above. 
In order to accommodate such qualif ied end mete- 
~mmectary  types of Informatkm, each event  templets 
may have emaciated with It one or more mote templates 
contA~ing Interpretive or evaluative Information. Thus, 
88 represented In Figure 5, an Imitantiated launch tent- 
plate produced frmn an obaervaUonal event  and a primi- 
t ive event  (a zeroth order reporting event,  ea i l lustrated 
in Figure 4) may have several  additional quallficetlorm 
(exemplif ied by, hut not Ilmlted to, the mete templates 
llh~streted In the figure). So, for  example, a meta 
evaltmttve template 2 mmoclated with • laundl  template 
exl=reales the Epalion reporterJs degree of  bel ief or 
m=nfidenco In the launch parameters he rep(x~a: the 
ob ject  in the event  template 18 belaeved by the Epalion 
reporter to be a CE (or Crop Enhancement) satel l i te from 
the Infometion presented In the observational re lx~ by 
the sensor,  end from hht owvl knowledge of  pest 
occurrences of  CE satel l i te launches, as wail as expea-  
teth:me of pG88iblc replacement ieunchee, etc., during 
p~rtlculer Use Intervals. All or none of  the listed 
psi 'easters for • launch event  may be qualified In this 
way. Thus, in Figure 5, the Epalk=n reporter bel ieves 
that, to the best of  hhl knowledge, the space object  
Involved In the major launch event  18 a "probable" CE or 
crop enhancement satell ite, and that the time of launch 
IS "approximate\[y" 113OZ. 
Each mete template ha8 field8 which Identify the source, 
am weft ms the Use and date of  the Interpretive Informa- 
t i l l .  As opposed to the "infosouroe= parameter of  these 
mote templates - -  which shows the ulUmate source of  
the Information contained in the Instantlatad templets --

this figure are Intended to be Il lustrative only: for 
example, the object,  date/t ime group, and deorbit 
information constitute embedded templates linked to 
the main "launch" event  template by pointers. In 
addition, there are several alternatives for more 
economical Internal representation of  mete template 
Ioformation, which are currently under review for the  
~'~uai design and Implementation o1' this information 
within MATRES and within the Actfvs/ Irrm~pective 
InformaUon System (a knowledge-based Intelligent

feeds. 
• Termx 584" )  Is NY'r, the new8 agency of  the Delta 
Corffederetiofl, Indicating that  this InformaUon came from 
in  NYT proml wmounoement quoted (and Interpreted) by 
an Epalion reporter. This distinguishes such Information 
frmu that relmremented by the "mmignn mete template, 
where the Epellon Republic reporting s ta f f  ~8algn an 
Identmcetlon number of  their own to the satel l i te pay-  
load far  fu twe referMme.  
Another signif icant analytical ~ of  the Epallon reporter  
In thio suemmlo 18 the ¢oem=eratlve valuation, XUuatrstod 
by the w~'omperQm mete template. These comparisons 
Involve overate which have takes place before, in thhs

An I ~  fINtOUolt of  mi te  templates Is to represent 
pimdkrtJve In/~N~tJons I.o., descriptk:m8 of events  
expe,~ed In the future, based on other events which 
have ocmHyed In the pe l t ,  or are currently In process. 
The "expect  e template in Figure 5 expresses  the 
presumable or expected  pMsJlrleters of  mission duration, 
and conaoqueRtly, the deorbit event  which 18 mltlclpated 
for (~tober  2~ 
To summarize, the function of  the mete templates Is to 
Identify and delimit evaluat ive commentary, which iso- 
lates the factual InformaUon presented In most zeroth 
order mote event  reports, and Identif ies Information per- 
taining to credibil ity o f  the event  occurrence, compere-

On the other hand, In addiUon to distinguishing the vsrl-  
o4J8 Iovehl o f  event  occuffenGe, observation, and report-  
Ing, the fonotJon of  the mete event  structure Il lustrated 
in Figures 2 and 4 Is to clearly demarcate the "Oetta 
versus Epallon" (in terms of  the scenario described 
above) aspects of  the messages. The reporters  o f  the 
Epailoll Republic "assign" "Specold" and "WSJ" IdeITtlfl-
