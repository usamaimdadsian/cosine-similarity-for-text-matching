As the acquisition problem of bilingual lists 
of terminological expressions i formidable, 
it is worthwhile to investigate methods to 
compile such lists as automatically as pos- 
sible. In this paper we discuss experimen- 
tal results for a number of methods, which 
operate on corpora of previously translated 
texts. 
Keywords :  parallel corpora, tagging, ter- 
minology acquisition. 
1 In t roduct ion  
In the past several years, many researchers have 
started looking at bilingual corpora, as they im- 
plicitly contain much information eeded for vari- 
ous purposes that would otherwise have to be com- 
piled manually. Some applications using information 
extracted from bilingual corpora are statistical MT 
(\[Brown et al., 1990\]), bilingual exicography (\[Cati- 
zone el al., 1989\]), word sense disambiguation (\[Gale 
et al., 1992\]), and multilingual information retrieval 
(\[Landauer and Littmann, 1990\]). 
The goal of the research discussed in this paper is 
to automate as much as possible the generation of 
bilingual term lists from previously translated texts. 
These lists are used by terminologists and transla- 
tors, e.g. in documentation departments. Manual 
compilation of bilingual term lists is an expensive 
and laborious effort, hence the relative rarity of spe- 
cialized, up-to-date, and manageable t rminological 
data collections. However, organizations interested 
in terminology and translation are likely to have 
archives of previously translated ocuments, which 
represent a considerable investment. Automatic or 
semi-automatic extraction of the information con- 
tained in these documents would then be an attrac- 
tive perspective. 
A bilingual term list is a list associating source 
language terms with a ranked list of target language 
terms. The methods to extract bilingual terminol- 
ogy from parallel texts were developed and evaluated 
experimentally using a bilingual, Dutch-English cor- 
pus. There are two phases in the process: 
1. Process the texts to extract terms. The defini- 
tion of the notion 'term' will be an important 
issue of this paper, as it is necessary to adopt a 
definition that facilitates comparison of terms in 
the source and target language. Section 4 will 
show some flaws of methods that define terms as 
words or nouns. Terminologists commonly use 
full noun phrases 1 as terms to express (domain- 
specific) concepts. The NP level is shown to be 
a better level to compare Dutch and English in 
sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
This phase acts as a linguistic front end to the 
second phase. The various techniques used to 
process the corpus are described in section 2. 
2. Apply statistic techniques to determine corres- 
pondences between source and target language. 
In section 3 we will introduce a simple algorithm 
to select and order potential translations for a 
given term. This method will subsequently be 
compared to two other methods discussed in the 
literature. 
The usual benefits of modularity apply because the 
two phases are highly independent. 
1To some extent, a particular domain will also have 
textual elements specific to the domain that are not NPs. 
We will ignore these, but essentially the same methods 
could be used to create bilingual ists of e.g. verbs.

This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 in- 
troduces the operations carried out on the evaluation 
corpus. Section 3 describes the translation selection 
method used. Section 4 discusses initial experiments 
which use words, resp. only nouns, as terms: Section 
5 contains an evaluation of a larger experiment in 
which NPs are used as terms. Related research isdis- 
cussed in \[Gaussier et al., 1992\], \[Gale and Church, 
1991a\] and \[Landauer and Littmann, 1990\]. Section 
6 compares our method with these approaches. Sec- 
tion 7 summarizes the paper, and compares our ap- 
proach to related research. 
2 Text  p reprocess ing  
A number of experiments were carried out on a sam- 
ple bilingual corpus, viz. Dutch and English ver- 
sions of the official announcement of he ESPRIT pro- 
gramme by the European Commission, the Dutch 
version of which contains ome 25,000 words. The 
texts have been preprocessed in several ways. 
Lexical Analysis Word and sentence boundaries 
were marked up in SGML. This involved taking into 
account issues like abbreviations, numerical expres- 
sions, character normalization. No morphological 
analysis (stemming or lemmatization) was applied. 
Al ignment The experiments were carried out on 
parallel texts aligned at the sentence level, i.e. the 
texts have been converted to corresponding segments 
of one, or a few, sentences. Reliable sentence align- 
ment algorithms are discussed in \[Brown et hi., 1991\] 
and \[Gale and Church, 1991b\]. For our experiments 
we used the Gale-Church method, which is imple- 
mented by Amy Winarske, ISSCO, Geneva. Figure 
1 is a display of two aligned segments.

Tagging In order to investigate the role of syn- 
tactic information, the texts have been tagged. A 
tagged version of the English text was supplied by 
Umist, Manchester. The Dutch version was tagged 
automatically using a tagger inspired on the En- 
glish tagger described in \[Church, 1988\]. This tag- 
ger uses as contextual information a trigram model 
constructed using a previously tagged corpus, viz. 
the "Eindhovense corpus". The system furthermore 
uses as lexical information a dictionary derived from 
a subset of the Celex lexical database, which con- 
tains information about the possible categories and 
relative frequencies of about 50,000 inflected Dutch 
word forms. 
Figure 2 shows the tagged aligned segments.

• Parsing On the basis of previous tagging, the texts 
are superficially parsed by simple pattern matching, 
where the objective is to extract a list of term noun 
phrases. The following grammer rule, where "w" is 
a marked up word, expresses that English term NPs 
consist of zero or more words tagged as adjectives 
followed by a one or more words tagged as nouns. 
* w + np --~ w a 
The grammar rule doesn't ake postnominal com- 
plements and modifiers into account, because the lex- 
icon lacks information to disambiguate PP attach- 
ment. We will later see (section 5.3) that this causes 
problems in relating Dutch and English NPs. Figure 
3 shows the result of parsing, with recognized NPs in 
bold face. Texts can be parsed in linear time using 
finite state techniques.

3 Trans la t ion  se lec t ion  
A number of variants of bilingual term acquisition 
algorithms have been implemented that operate on 
parallel texts. These methods use the output of 
the operations in section 2, then build a database 
of "translational co-occurrences", determine and or- 
der target language terms for each source language 
term, (optionally) apply filtering using threshold val- 
ues, and write a report. 
The selection and ordering technique used is simi- 
lar to another well-known ranking method, viz. mu- 
tual information. We will compare xperimental re- 
suits based on our method and on mutual informa- 
tion in section 6.1. 
Co-occur rence  In conducting our experiments, a 
simple statistic measure was used to rank the prob- 
ability that a target language term is the translation 
of a source language item. This measure is based on 
114 
the intuition that the translation of a term is likely 
to be more frequent in the subset of target 2 text seg- 
ments aligned to source text segments containing the 
source language term than in the entire target lan- 
guage text. 
The method consists in building a "global" fre- 
quency table for all target language terms. Further- 
more, for each source language term, a "sub-corpus" 
of target text segments aligned to source language 
segments containing that source language term is 
created. A separate, "local" frequency table of tar- 
get language terms is built for each source language 
term. Candidate translation terms l/for a source lan- 
guage term sl are ranked by dividing the "local" fre- 
quency by their "global" frequency, and select those 
pairs for which the result > 1. 
freqloeat (tllsl) 
freqalobat (tl) 
Thresho ld  An important drawback of this defini- 
tion is that very low-frequent target language terms, 
which just happen to occur in an aligned segment will 
get unrealistically high scores. To eliminate these, we 
imposed a threshold by removing from the list those 
target language terms whose local frequency was be- 
low a certain threshold. The threshold is defined in 
terms of the global frequency of the source language 
term. 
freqto,at (tllsl) > threshold 
freqalobat (sl) -- 
The default threshold used was 50%. However, 
this restriction does not improve results for those 
source language terms that are infrequent hem- 
selves. The effects of variation of this threshold 
on precision and recall are discussed in section 5.2, 
where it will be shown that the threshold, as a pa- 
rameter of the program, can be modified by the user 
to give a higher priority to precision or to recall. 
Similar filters could be established by defining a 
threshold in terms of the global frequency of the tar- 
get language term. One could also require minimal 
absolute values 3. 
Pos l t ion-sens i t iv i ty  An option to the selection 
method is to calculate the "expected" position of 
the translation of a term (using the size 4 of source 
and target fragments and the position of the source 
term in the source segment). For the target language 
terms, the score is decreased proportionally to the 
~It should be noted that we are comparing two trans- 
lationally related texts; there need not be an actual di- 
rectional source ---* target relation between the texts. 
3For example, \[Gaussier et al., 1992\] selected source 
language terms co-occurring more than six times with 
target language terms.

ber of words (or nouns, NPs) in the segments. 
distance from the expected position, normalized by 
the size of the target segment 5.
4 Word and noun-based methods 
4.1 Exper iment  
In the word and noun-based methods, a test suite 
of 100 Dutch words which were tagged as a noun 
was selected at random. In the word-based method, 
the frequencies being compared are the frequencies 
of the word forms. In the noun-based method, only 
frequencies of nouns are compared. Figure 4 shows 
the result of some experiments. The quality of the 
methods can be measured in recall -whether or not 
a translation of a term is found- and precision. We 
define precision as the ability of the program to as- 
sign the translation, given that this translation has 
been found, the highest relevance score. 
Figure 4: Word and noun-based methods 
\[ Term \[ Pos i t ion

noun yes 
Recal l  \[ P rec is ion  
52% 33% 
52% 77% 
48% 49% 
43% 77% 
The experiments demonstrate that position- 
sensitivity results in a major improvement of pre- 
cision. The size of the segments of the aligned pro- 
gram is still fairly large (on average, over 24 words 
per segment in the test corpus), therefore there will 
in general be a lot of candidate translations for a 
given term. Especially in the ease of a small corpus 
such as ours, this results in a tendency to return a 
number of terms as ex aequo highest scoring items. 
Apparently, there is little distortion in the order of 
terms in the corpus. 
Another conclusion that can be drawn from the 
examples is that use of categorial information alone 
does not improve precision, even though the num- 
ber of candidate translations is great ly reduced. 
Position-sensitivity is a much more effective way to 
achieve improved precision. One factor explaining 
this lack of succes is the error rate introduced by 
text tagging, which the word-based method does not 
suffer from. As expected, there is an inherent reduc- 
tion in recall because nouns do not always translate 
to nouns. 
Figure 5 shows an example of the output of the 
position-sensitive, word-based system. The word in- 
dustry occurs 88 times globally (fourth output col- 
umn) in the corpus, twice locally, in segments aligned

scores are no longer simple co-occurrence ounts, whereas 
global scores till are. This is partly responsible for lower 
recall in figures 4 and 9.

to segments containing industrietak. This local fre- 
quency is adapted to 1.8315.. (the third output col- 
umn), because of position-sensitivity.

4.2 Eva luat ion  
The real concern raised by the results of the four 
methods discussed is the very low recall. There are 
various categories of errors common to all methods, 
which will be discussed in more detail in the evalua- 
tion of a much larger experiment in section 5.3. 
However, a more fundamental problem specific to 
the word and noun-based methods is the inability 
to extract ranslational information between higher- 
level units such as noun phrases or compounds. The 
English compound programme management is re- 
lated to a single Dutch word, viz. programmabeheer, 
and even more complex sequences such as high speed 
data processing capability are translations of snelle 
gegevensverwerkingscapaciteit, where high speed is 
mapped to the adjective snel and data processing ca- 
pability to gegevensverwerkingscapaciteit. The com- 
pound problem alone represents 65% of the errors, 
and is a general problem which comes up in com- 
paring languages like German or Dutch to languages 
like French or English. 
Although the compound problem can also be ad- 
dressed by morphological decomposition of com- 
pounds, there are two other advantages to com- 
pare the languages at the phrasal rather than at the 
(tagged) lexical level. 
Sometimes, an ambiguous noun is disambiguated 
by an adjective, e.g. financial statement, where the 
adjective imposes a particular eading on the head 
noun. A phrasal method is then based on less am- 
biguous terms, and will therefore yield more refined 
translations. 
Furthermore, the method implicitly lexicalizes 
translation of collocational effects between adjectives 
and head nouns. 
5 Phrase-based  methods  
5.1 Eva luat ion  of  phase-based methods  
Initial experiments with a phrase-based method 
showed a small quality increase. However, in order to 
evaluate the performance of the phrase-based meth- 
ods in more detail, a much larger and representative 
collection of NPs was selected. This collection con- 
sisted of 1100 Dutch NPs, which is 17% of the total 
number of NPs in the Dutch text. 
A list associating these terms to their correct 
translations was compiled semi-automatically, b  us- 
ing some of the methods described in this paper and 
checking and correcting the results manually. 61 NPs 
were removed from the collection because the trans- 
lation of some occurrences of these terms turned out 
to be incorrect, very indirect, simply missing from 
the text, or because they suffered from low-level for- 
matting errors or typing errors. Also, a program to 
automate the evaluation process was implemented. 
The remaining set was divided in two groups. 
1. One group contained 706 pairs of NPs which 
the extraction algorithms should be able extract 
from the text, because they occur in correctly 
aligned segments, and are tagged and parsed 
correctly. 
2. The other group consists of 334 NPs which it 
would not be able to extract because of one or a 
combination of errors in one of the preprocessing 
steps. Section 5.3 contains a detailed analysis of 
these errors. 
It is important o note that due to these errors, 
the extraction algorithms will not be able to achieve 
recall beyond 68%. Nevertheless, the acquisition al- 
gorithms, when operating on NPs instead of words 
or nouns, perform markedly better, cf. figure 6. The 
recall of both methods is 64%, which is much better 
than word and noun-based methods. When only tak- 
ing into account he group of 706 items which didn't 
have any preprocessing errors, recall is even 94%. Fi- 
nally, precision again improves considerably by ap- 
plying position-sensitivity. Section 5.4 discusses at- 
tempts to further improve precision.

5.2 Tunab i l i ty  
The threshold is defined in terms of the source lan- 
guage term frequency. As can be expected, a high 
threshold results in relatively higher precision and 
relatively lower recall. Figure 7 shows some fig- 
ures of varying thresholds with the position-sensitive 
method. As in figure 6, the score in parentheses i  
the recall score when attention is restricted to the set 
of 706 NPs. The 50% threshold is the default for the 
experiments discussed in this paper, cf. the second 
row of table 6. 
The threshold value of our method is a parameter 
that can be changed, so that an appropriate thresh- 
old can be selected, depending on the desired priority 
of precision and recall.

5.3 Analys is  o f  e r rors  af fect ing recal l  
The errors can be classified and quantified as follows. 
There are four classes of technical problems caused 
by the various preprocessing phases, and two classes 
of fundamental counter-examples. These are the four 
classes of errors due to preprocessing. 
1. Incorrect alignment of text segments accounts 
for 6% of the errors. 
2. In 15% of the errors part of a term is tagged 
incorrectly. This is often due to lexicon errors. 
An incompatibility between lexical classification 
schemes accounts for another 7% of the errors. 
The Dutch tagger also has no facility to deal 
with occasional use of English in Dutch text 
(4%). 
3. The tagger (and its dictionary) currently doesn't 
recognize multi word units, hence e.g. with res- 
pect to wrongly yields the term respect (6%). 
4. In many cases the syntactic structures of the 
terms in the two languages do not match. This 
is the main source of errors (47%). The pattern 
matcher ignores postnominal PP arguments and 
modifiers in both languages. However, a Dutch 
postnominal PP argument often maps to the 
first part of an English noun-noun compound, 
as in the following example, where markt maps 
to market and versplintering to fragmentation. 
versplinteringn vanp ,--+ market,, 
ded marktn fragmentationn 
The majority of errors (85%) is therefore due to er- 
rors in text preprocessing, where there are still many 
possible improvements. The remaining two classes 
are fundamental counter-examples. 
1. In a number of cases (15%), NPs do not trans- 
late to NPs, e.g. the following Dutch sentence 
contains the equivalent of careful management. 
sneliea maaxe ~ needsv 
zorgvuldige~ leidingr, tOrn be~ rapida butt 
vraagt~ carefullyadv 
managed~ 
2. In two cases (1%), the solution of a genuine 
. ambiguity by the tagger did not correspond to 
the interpretation imposed by the translation. 
In the following example, the deverbal mean- 
ing of vervaardiging imposes the interpretation 
of manufacturing as a gerund. 
hoofdaccent,, opp ded ~ rnaina emphasis,~ onp 
vervaardigingn vanp manufacturingn/v: 
elementenn elementsn 
However, these two classes affect only 5% of all 
terms. The theoretically maximal recall, assuming 
that the alignment program, tagger and NP parser 
all perform fully correctly, is 95%. Since the parser is 
currently extremely simplistic, we expect hat major 
improvements can be readily achieved s.
5.4  Improv ing  prec is ion  
The results in figure 6 and 7 show an important im- 
provement in recall. One factor impeding better pre- 
cision is the small size of the corpus. In our corpus, 
71% of the Dutch NPs is unique in the corpus, and 
precision suffers from sparsity of data. Still, it is 
useful to investigate ways to improve precision. 
One obvious option we explored was to exploit 
compositionality in translation. The Dutch terms in 
figure 8 all contain the 'subterm' schakelingen, the 
English terms the subterm circuits. This evident 
regularity is not exploited by any of the discussed 
methods. We experimented with an approach where 
co-occurrence tables are built of terms as well as of 
heads of terms 7and where this information is used in 
the selection and ordering of translations. Surpris- 
ingly, this improved results for non-positional meth- 
ods, but not for positional methods. We do expect 
these regularities to emerge with much larger cor- 
pora. 
There are some other possibilities which could be 
explored. The terms could lemmatized, so that infor- 
mation about inflectional variants can be combined. 
There may also be a correlation in length of terms 
and their translations. Finally, the alignment pro- 
gram provides a measure of the quality of alignment, 
which is not yet used by the program. 
6 Re la ted  Research  
In this section we compare our work with two other 
methods reported on in the literature. In section 6.1 
we compare our work to work discussed in \[Gaussier 
et al., 1992\], which is based on mutual informa- 
tion. Section 6.2 discusses \[Gale and Church, 1991a\], 
which is based on the ¢2 statistic. 
°It is conceivable to partly automate the acquisition of 
the necessary lexical knowledge, viz. determining which 
nouns are likely to take PP complements, but our corpus 
is too small for this type of knowledge acquisition. 
7In fact, it turned out to be better to use final sub- 
strings (e.g. six or seven characters) of the head noun of 
the NP instead of the head itself to avoid the compound 
problem discussed in section 4.2.

A third method to extract bilingual terminology 
is the use of latent semantic indexing, cf. \[Landauer 
and Littmann, 1990\]. Latent semantic indexing is 
a vector model, where a term-document matrix is 
transformed toa space of much less dimensions using 
a technique called singular value decomposition. In
the resulting matrix, distributionally similar terms, 
such as synonyms, are represented by similar vec- 
tors. When applied to a collection of documents and 
their translations, terms will be represented by vec- 
tors similar to the representations of their transla- 
tions. We have not yet compared our method to this 
approach. 
6.1 Mutua l  in fo rmat ion  
The selection and ranking method is not based on 
the concept of mutual information (cf. \[Church and 
Hanks, 1989\]), though the technique is quite similar. 
The mutual information score compares the prob- 
ability of observing two items together (in aligned 
segments) to the product of their individual proba- 
bilities. 
P(st, t0 
I(sl, tl) = log 2 P(s l )P(t l )  
The difference is that in our method the global 
frequency of the source language term is only used 
in the threshold, and is not used for computing 
the translational relevance score. Mutual informa- 
tion is used for translation selection and ranking in 
\[Gaussier et al., 1992\]. For comparison, the evalu- 
ation was repeated using mutual information as se- 
lection and ordering criterium. The first two rows in 
figure 9 show mutual information achieves improved 
recall when compared to figure 6, but at the expense 
of reduced precision s. 
In \[Gaussier d al., 1992\] a filter is used which elim- 
inates all candidate target language terms that do 
not provide more information on any other source 
language term. The last two rows in figure 9 show 
results from our implementation f that technique. 
sit is possible to select only pairs with a mutual infor- 
mation score greater than some minimum value, which 
reduces recall and improves precision. However, reduc- 
ing recall to the level in figure 6 still leaves precision at 
a level much below the precision level given there. 
In both cases, the threshold results in a huge im- 
provement of precision, at the expense of recall. The 
position-sensitive r sult is comparable to the 90% 
row in table 7. '

6.2 The  ¢2 method 
In \[Gale and Church, 1991a\], another association 
measure is used, viz. ¢2, a X2-1ike statistic. In the 
following formula, assume a is the co-occurrence fre- 
quency of a source language term sl and a target 
language term tl, b the frequency of sl minus a, c the 
frequency of tl minus a, and d the number of regions 
containing neither sl, nor tl. 
¢2 = (ad - be) 2 
(a + b) (a + c) (b + d) (c + d) 
As in the other methods, the co-occurrence fre- 
quency can be modified to reflect position-sensitivity. 
We incorporated this measure into our system and 
evaluated the performance. This result is similar to 
the 25% threshold in figure 7.

7 Discussion 
In this paper a number of methods to extract bilin- 
gual terminology from aligned corpora were dis- 
cussed. The methods consist of a linguistic term 
extraction phase and a statistic translation selection 
phase. 
The best term extraction method (in terms of re- 
call) turned out to be a method that defines terms 
as NPs. NPs are extracted from text using part of 
speech tagging and pattern matching. Both tagging 
and NP-extraction can still be improved consider- 
ably. Precision is improved by preferring terms at 
'similar' positions in target language segments. 
The translation selection method selects and or- 
ders translations of a term by comparing lobal and 
118 
local frequencies of the target language terms, sub- 
ject to a threshold condition defined in terms of the 
frequency of the source language term. The thresh- 
old is a parameter which can be used to give priority 
to precision or recall. 
The re-implementation f the algorithms discussed 
in \[Gaussier el al., 1992\] and \[Gale and Church, 
1991a\] results in precision/recall figures comparable 
to our method. It should be noted that these studies 
establish correspondences between words rather than 
phrases. We have shown a phrasal approach yields 
improved recall in the Dutch-English language pair. 
These studies dealt with an English-French corpus. 
To some extent, the mismatch due to compounding 
may be less problematic for this language pair, but 
the example of the translation of the English expres- 
sion House of Commons to Chambre des Communes 9 
shows this language pair would also benefit from a 
phrasal approach. These are lexicalized phrases and 
are described as such in dictionaries 1°. 
Another difference is that position-sensitivity in 
ranking potential translations i not taken advantage 
of in the earlier proposals. Tables 9 and 10 show 
these methods also benefit from this extension. Both 
proposals also have no direct analog to our threshold 
parameter, which allows for prioritizing precision or 
recall (cf. section 5.2). 
One aspect not covered at all in our proposal is 
the technical problem of memory requirements which 
will emerge when using very large corpora. This is- 
sue is discussed in \[Gale and Church, 1991a\]. Future 
experiments should definitely concentrate on experi- 
ments with much larger corpora, because these would 
allow us to carry out realistic experiments with tech- 
niques such as mentioned in section 5.4. We also ex- 
pect precision to improve in larger corpora, because 
most NPs are unique in the small corpus we used so 
far.

NP-recognition, because the PP of Commons would not 
be attached to the NP by the NP rule in section 2.
