Abstract
With the exponential growth of scholarly
data during the past few years, effective
methods for topic classification are greatly
needed. Current approaches usually re-
quire large amounts of expensive labeled
data in order to make accurate predictions.
In this paper, we posit that, in addition to
a research article’s textual content, its ci-
tation network also contains valuable in-
formation. We describe a co-training ap-
proach that uses the text and citation infor-
mation of a research article as two differ-
ent views to predict the topic of an article.
We show that this method improves sig-
nificantly over the individual classifiers,
while also bringing a substantial reduction
in the amount of labeled data required for
training accurate classifiers.
1 Introduction
As science advances, scientists around the world
continue to produce a large number of research ar-
ticles, which provide the technological basis for
worldwide dissemination of scientific discoveries.
Online digital libraries such as Google Scholar,
CiteSeer
x
, and PubMed store and index millions
of such research articles and their metadata, and
make it easier for researchers to search for scien-
tific information. These libraries require effective
and efficient methods for topic classification of re-
search articles in order to facilitate the retrieval of
content that is tailored to the interests of specific
individuals or groups. Supervised approaches for
topic classification of research articles have been
developed, which generally use either the content
of the articles (Caragea et al., 2011), or take into
account the citation relation between research ar-
ticles (Lu and Getoor, 2003).
To be successful, these supervised approaches
assume the availability of large amounts of labeled
data, which require intensive human labeling ef-
fort. In this paper, we explore a semi-supervised
approach that can exploit large amounts of un-
labeled data together with small amounts of la-
beled data for accurate topic classification of re-
search articles, while minimizing the human ef-
fort required for data labeling. In the scholarly do-
main, research articles (or papers) are highly inter-
connected in giant citation networks, in which pa-
pers cite or are cited by other papers. We posit
that, in addition to a document’s textual content
and its local neighborhood in the citation network,
other information exists that has the potential to
improve topic classification. For example, in a
citation network, information flows from one pa-
per to another via the citation relation (Shi et al.,
2010). This information flow and the topical influ-
ence of one paper on another are specifically cap-
tured by means of citation contexts, i.e., short text
segments surrounding a citation’s mention.
These contexts are not arbitrary, but they of-
ten serve as brief summaries of a cited paper. We
therefore hypothesize that these micro-summaries
can be successfully used as an independent view
of a research article in a co-training framework to
reduce the amount of labeled data needed for the
task of topic classification.
The idea of using terms from citation contexts
stems from the analysis of hyperlinks and the
graph structure of the Web, which are instrumen-
tal in Web search (Manning et al., 2008). Many
search engines follow the intuition that the an-
chor text pointing to a page is a good descrip-
tor of its content, and thus anchor text terms are
used as additional index terms for a target web-
page. The use of links and anchor text was
thoroughly researched for information retrieval
(Koolen and Kamps, 2010), broadening a user’s
search (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), query refinement
(Kraft and Zien, 2004), and enriching document
representations (Metzler et al., 2009). Blum and
2357
Mitchell (1998) introduced the co-training algo-
rithm using hyperlinks and anchor text as a sec-
ond, independent view of the data for classifying
webpages, in addition to a webpage content.
Contributions and Organization. We present
a co-training approach to topic classification of re-
search papers that effectively incorporates infor-
mation from a citation network, in addition to the
information contained in each paper. The result of
this classification task will aid indexing of docu-
ments in digital libraries, and hence, will lead to
improved organization, search, retrieval, and rec-
ommendation of scientific documents. Our contri-
butions are as follows:
• We propose the use of citation contexts as
an additional view in a co-training approach,
which results in high accuracy classifiers. To
our knowledge, this has not been addressed
in the literature.
• We show experimentally that our co-training
classifiers significantly outperform: (1) su-
pervised classifiers trained using either con-
tent or citation contexts independently, for
the same fraction of labeled data; and (2) sev-
eral other semi-supervised classifiers, trained
on the same fractions of labeled and unla-
beled data as co-training.
• We also show that using the citation context
information available in citation networks,
the human effort involved in data labeling for
training accurate classifiers can be largely re-
duced. Our co-training classifiers trained on a
very small sample of labeled data and a large
sample of unlabeled data yield accurate topic
classification of research articles.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we discuss related work. Section 3
describes our data and its characteristics, followed
by the presentation of our proposed co-training ap-
proach in Section 4. We present experiments and
results in Section 5, and conclude the paper and
present future directions of our work in Section 6.
2 Related Work
We discuss here the most relevant works to our
study. A large variety of methods have been pro-
posed in the literature with regard to automatic
text classification and topic prediction. Differ-
ent classifiers have been applied on the Vector
Space Model (VSM), in which a document is rep-
resented as a vector of words or phrases asso-
ciated with their TF-IDF score, i.e. term fre-
quency - inverse document frequency (Zhang et al.,
2011; Kansheng et al., 2011). VSM is the most
used method due to its simple, efficient and easy
to understand implementation. Another widely
used model is the Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)
where co-occurrences are analyzed to find seman-
tic relationships between words or phrases (Zhang
et al., 2011; Ganiz et al., 2011). Moreover, a great
range of classifiers were used for this task, includ-
ing: Na¨?ve Bayes (Lewis and Ringuette, 1994), K-
nearest neighbors (Yang, 1999) and Support Vec-
tor Machines (Joachims, 1998). These techniques,
however, all require a large number of labeled doc-
uments in order to build accurate classifiers. In
contrast, we propose a co-training algorithm that
only requires a small amount of labeled data in or-
der to make accurate topic classification.
Semi-supervised methods essentially involve
different means of transferring labels from labeled
to unlabeled samples in the process of learning
a classifier that can generalize well on new un-
seen data. Co-training was originally introduced
in (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) where it was used
to classify web pages into academic course home
page or not. This approach has two views of the
data as follows: the content of a web page, and
the words found in the anchor text of the hyper-
links that point to the web page. Wan (2009)
used co-training for cross-lingual sentiment clas-
sification of product reviews, where English and
Chinese features were considered as two indepen-
dent views of the data. Furthermore, Gollapalli
et al. (2013) used co-training to identify authors’
homepages from the current-day university web-
sites. The paper presents novel features, extracted
from the URL of a page, that were used in con-
junction with content features, forming two com-
plementary views of the data.
Citation networks have been used before in
other problems. Caragea et al. (2014) used ci-
tation contexts to extract informative features for
keyphrase extraction. Lu and Getoor (2003) pro-
posed an approach for document classification that
used only citation links, without any textual data
from the citation contexts. Ritchie et al. (2006)
used a combination of terms from citation contexts
and existing index terms of a paper to improve in-
dexing of cited papers. Citation contexts were also
used to improve the performance of citation rec-
ommendation systems (Kataria et al., 2010) and
to study author influence in document networks
2358
(Kataria et al., 2011). Moreover, citation con-
texts were used for scientific paper summariza-
tion (Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011; Qazvinian et
al., 2010; Qazvinian and Radev, 2008; Mei and
Zhai, 2008; Lehnert et al., 1990) For example,
in Qazvinian et al. (2010), a set of important
keyphrases is extracted first from the citation con-
texts in which the paper to be summarized is cited
by other papers and then the “best” subset of sen-
tences that contain such keyphrases is returned as
the summary. Mei and Zhai (2008) used informa-
tion from citation contexts to determine what sen-
tences of a paper are of high impact (as measured
by the influence of a target paper on further stud-
ies of similar or related topics). These sentences
constitute the impact-based summary of the paper.
Despite the use of citation contexts and anchor
text in many information retrieval and natural lan-
guage processing tasks, to our knowledge, we are
the first to propose the incorporation of citation
context information available in citation networks
in a co-training framework for topic classification
of research papers.
3 Data
The dataset used in our experiments is a subset
sampled from the CiteSeer
x
digital library
1
and la-
beled by Dr. Lise Getoor’s research group at the
University of Maryland. This subset was previ-
ously used in several studies including (Lu and
Getoor, 2003) and (Kataria et al., 2010). The
dataset consists of 3186 labeled papers, with each
paper being categorized into one of six classes:
Agents, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information
Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) and Databases (DB).
For each paper, we acquire the citation contexts
directly from CiteSeer
x
. A citation context is de-
fined as a window of n words surrounding a cita-
tion mention. We differentiate between cited and
citing contexts for a paper as follows: let d be a
target paper and C be a citation network such that
d ? C. A cited context for d is a context in which
d is cited by some paper d
i
in C. A citing context
for d is a context in which d is citing some paper
d
j
in C. If a paper is cited in multiple contexts
within another paper, the contexts are aggregated
into a single context. For each paper in the dataset,
we have at least one cited or one citing context. A
summary of the dataset is provided in Table 1.

cccAvg. Cited Contexts Avg. Citing Contexts
45.59 20.77
Table 1: Dataset summary.
As expected, we have a higher number of cited
contexts than citing contexts. This is due to the
page restrictions often imposed to research articles
that can limit the number of papers each article can
cite. On the other hand, a good research paper can
accumulate hundreds of citations, and hence, cited
contexts over the years.
Context lengths. In CiteSeer
x
, citation con-
texts have about 50 words on each side of a ci-
tation mention. A previous study by Ritchie et al.
(2008) shows that a fixed window length of about
100 words around a citation mention is generally
effective for information retrieval tasks. For this
reason, we use the contexts provided by CiteSeer
x
directly. In future, it would be interesting to study
more sophisticated approaches to identifying the
text that is relevant to a target citation (Abu-Jbara
and Radev, 2012; Teufel, 1999) and study the in-
fluence of context lengths on our task.
For all experiments, our labeled dataset is split
in train, validation and test sets. The validation
and test sets have about 200 papers each. We sam-
pled another set of papers from the labeled dataset
in order to simulate the existence of unlabeled
data, with a fixed size of around 2000 papers. The
remaining 786 papers are used as labeled training
data. Each experiment was repeated 10 times with
10 different random seeds and the results were av-
eraged.
4 Co-Training for Topic Classification
Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed the co-
training algorithm in the context of webpage clas-
sification. In co-training, the idea is that two clas-
sifiers trained on two different views of the data
teach one another by re-training each classifier on
the data enriched with predicted examples that the
other classifier is most confident about. In Blum
and Mitchell (1998), webpages are represented us-
ing two different views: (1) using terms from web-
pages’ content and (2) using terms from the anchor
text of hyperlinks pointing to these pages.

In this paper, we study the applicability and ex-
tension of the co-training algorithm to the task of
topic classification of research papers, which are
embedded in large citation networks. Here, in ad-
dition to the information contained in a paper it-
self, citing and cited papers capture different as-
pects (e.g., topicality, domain of study, algorithms
used) about the target paper (Teufel et al., 2006),
with citation contexts playing an instrumental role.
We conjecture that citation contexts, which act as
brief summaries about a cited paper, provide im-
portant clues in predicting the topicality of a target
paper. These clues give rise to the design of our
co-training based model for topic classification of
research papers. In our model, we use the content
of a paper as one view and the citation contexts as
another view of our data. In particular, for the con-
tent of a paper, we use its title and abstract as it is
commonly used in the literature (Lu and Getoor,
2003); for the citation contexts, we use both the
cited and citing contexts, as described in the pre-
vious section.
Our co-training procedure is described in Algo-
rithm 1. L and U represent the labeled and un-
labeled datasets and contain instances from both
views. The fractions of the training set are ob-
tained from the 786 papers by selecting k% ran-
dom examples from each class. For a round of
co-training, we train classifiers C
1
and C
2
on the
two views. Next, s examples are sampled from
the unlabeled data into S, and C
1
, C
2
are used
to obtain predictions for these s examples. The
GetMostConfidentExamples method is a generic
placeholder that stands for a function that deter-
mines what examples from S are chosen to be
added into training. Finally, at the end of an it-
eration, the examples left into S are moved back
to U , and the algorithm iterates until there are no
more unlabeled examples in U . The final classi-
fier C is obtained by combining C
1
and C
2
using
the product of their class probability distributions.
The class with the highest posterior probability (of
the product of the two distributions) is chosen as
the predicted class.
Unlike the original co-training algorithm de-
scribed by Blum and Mitchell (1998), which tack-
led a binary classification task (course vs. non-
course page classification), we address a multi-
class classification problem, where each example
(i.e., research paper) is classified into one of six
different classes. Moreover, in Blum and Mitchell
(1998), the co-training algorithm moves p highest
confidence positive examples and n highest confi-
dence negative examples from S to L, where p : n
represents the class distribution in the original la-
beled training set (i.e., if there are 10 positive ex-
amples and 90 negative examples in the labeled
set L, then p = 1 positive and n = 9 negative
examples are moved to the labeled set at each it-
eration of co-training). Unlike, this approach that
preserves the class distribution of the original la-
beled training set, we move into L all examples
that are classified with a confidence above a cer-
tain threshold.
5 Results and Discussion
First, the proposed method is evaluated on the val-
idation set. We first compare it against various
supervised and semi-supervised baselines. Next,
we report the performance of our co-training algo-
rithm under different scenarios, where either cited
or citing contexts are used. We also show the most
informative words for each classifier. Finally, with
the best parameters obtained on the validation set,
we report the precision, recall and F1-score, ob-
tained by each method, on the test set.
In experiments, the sample size ‘s’ from Algo-
rithm 1 is set to 300, i.e. the number of documents
sampled from the unlabeled pool at each iteration;
the confidence threshold is set to 0.95, i.e. if both
classifiers agree on the class label and have a con-
fidence ? 0.95, the instance is labeled and moved
into the labeled training set. These parameters are
estimated on the validation set, but the results are
not shown due to space limitation.

Evaluation Measures. We report results aver-
aged over ten different runs with random splits.
For each random split, we return the weighted
average precision, recall and F1-score. In all
the experiments, we use the Na¨?ve Bayes Multi-
nomial classifier and its Weka implementation
2
,
with term-frequencies as feature values. We ex-
perimented with both TF and TF-IDF scores, us-
ing different classifiers (Support Vector Machine,
Na¨?ve Bayes Multinomial, and simple Na¨?ve
Bayes classifiers), but Naive Bayes Multinomial
with TF performed best.
5.1 Baseline Comparisons
How does co-training compare with supervised
learning techniques? In this experiment, we com-
pare our co-training method with two supervised
baselines: (1) when only document content is used
and (2) when only citation contexts are used.
Figure 1 shows the F1-scores achieved using
different initial training sizes. We can see that
overall, the citation contexts are better at predict-
ing the topic of a document compared with the
content, outperforming them in 9 out of 10 exper-
imental settings. The only exception to this trend
is when a small number (5%) of training instances
is available, in which case the supervised con-
tent view performs better, reaching an F1-score of
0.534. Regardless, the co-training method shows
significant improvement over both baselines, in all
experiments. Starting with an F1-score of 0.572, it
continues to improve its performance as the train-
ing percentage is increasing. The maximum F1-
score, i.e. 0.742, is reached when 30% of the la-
beled training set is used. Note that the difference
in performance between co-training and the two
supervised baselines is statistically significant for
2
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/
a p value of 0.05.
A fully supervised baseline that uses 100% of
the training set achieves an F1-score of 0.720 (us-
ing content) and 0.738 (using citation contexts).
In contrast, co-training requires only 15% of the
labeled training set to outperform the fully super-
vised content baseline and 30% of the training set
to outperform the fully supervised citation con-
texts baseline. Consequently, using a co-training
approach that includes citation contexts as well as
the document content can not only increase the
performance, but will also significantly reduce the
need of expensive labeled instances.
Figure 2 illustrates the confusion matrices of
three experiments: (a) supervised content view,
i.e. the title and abstract, (b) supervised citation
contexts view, and (c) co-training that uses both
views. These experiments use 10% of the training
set. Each of the matrices are represented by a heat
map, i.e. the redder the color, the higher the value
assigned to that position. An accuracy of 1 will
be represented by a matrix with red blocks on the
main diagonal and white blocks everywhere else.
This experiment was performed 10 times with 10
different seeds and the results have been averaged.
As can be seen, the matrix that uses only titles
and abstracts, i.e. left side, is showing the high-
est percentage of misclassified documents, classi-
fying correctly about 58.8% instances, on average.
Using only citation contexts in a supervised frame-
work, i.e. center matrix, we reach a higher ac-
curacy of 60.7%. The co-training method, which
uses the content of the paper and citations as two
independent views, significantly increases the av-
erage accuracy to 67.3%. This experiment shows
that citation contexts are better than titles and ab-
stracts at predicting the topic of a document. Fur-
thermore, our proposed approach, which uses the
content of the paper as well as citation contexts,
achieves higher results than each view used sepa-
rately. The difference in accuracy is statistically
significant across all three experiments for a p
value of 0.05.
Overall, the Agents class seem to be the easiest
to classify, reaching an accuracy value of 91.6%
when using co-training. On the other hand, the
AI class is the hardest to classify. One reason for
this is that the AI class contains the lowest num-
ber of instances in the dataset. Another can be that
the AI class is the most general among all classes
and therefore, classifying documents with this la-
2361

Left: using titles and abstracts; Center: using citation contexts; Right: using co-training.

bel can be a difficult task even for a human. Other
common misclassifications occur between classes
like HCI and Agents, ML and IR or AI and ML, due
to their similarity.
How does our co-training method compare
with other supervised approaches? In this exper-
iment, we compare the performance of co-training
against two other methods: early and late fusion.
In early fusion, the feature vectors of the two
views are concatenated, creating a single represen-
tation of the data. In contrast, late fusion trains
two separate classifiers and then combines them
by taking the label with the highest confidence.
Figure 3 shows this comparison over differ-
ent training sizes. The results show that the co-
training method is more accurate than all others,
performing best in all 10 experimental settings.
Late fusion has an overall lower performance com-
pared with co-training, but is in a tight correlation
with it. On the other hand, early fusion achieves
the lowest F1-score across the experiments. The
reported results are statistically significant at p
value of 0.05, when the training percentage is be-
tween 5 and 35. Therefore, we can say that train-

ing two separate classifiers, one of each view,
yields higher performance compared with train-
ing a single classifier that incorporates both views.
Moreover, using a co-training approach that incor-
porates information from unlabeled data into the
model, will help the two classifiers increase their
confidences and minimize the error rate.
How does co-training compare with semi-
supervised methods? Here, we present re-
sults comparing co-training with two other well-
known semi-supervised techniques: self-training
and Na¨?ve Bayes with Expectation Maximization.
Self-Training. First, we show results of the com-
parison of co-training with two variations of self-
training: (1) self-training using only document
content, and (2) self-training using only citation
contexts. Figure 4 shows the results of this exper-
iment. Self-training is similar to co-training, ex-
cept that it uses only one view of the data (Zhu,
2005). Self-training parameters, e.g., sample size
‘s’ or number of iterations, are estimated as in co-
training.
Although the document content version of self-
training outperforms co-training when using 5%
2362
Figure 5: Co-Training vs. EM.
of the training instances, we can see that overall,
there is a significant difference in terms of F1-
score values in the favor of co-training. In 9 out
of 10 experiments, our co-training approach is su-
perior to both self-training methods. The results
are statistically significant across all experimental
setups for a p value of 0.05.
Expectation Maximization. Figure 5 shows the
F1-score values obtained after running NBM with
EM with the same training, unlabeled and test sets.
The EM algorithm uses the same classifier, i.e.
NBM, and the weight for each unlabeled instance
is set to 1, as this setting achieved the highest re-
sults. Two different experiments were performed
using EM: (1) using only document content, and
(2) using only citation contexts. As can be seen in
the figure, overall, the co-training approach signif-
icantly outperforms both variations of EM. How-
ever, the co-training method falls short when using
5% of the training instances, where EM Content
and EM Citations methods are achieving higher
F1-score values. Nonetheless, both EM variations
tend to achieve an F1-score value below or equal
to 0.710, whereas co-training reaches performance
values of 0.74 or higher. Again, the comparison
results between co-training and both variations of
EM are statistically significant for training sizes
between 10% and 50%, for a p value of 0.05.
5.2 Using Different Citation Context Types
Which of the two types of citation contexts (cited
or citing) help the task of topic classification
more and how does co-training perform in the
absence of either one? The answer to this ques-
tion is important as there are cases in which cita-
tion contexts are not readily available. One fre-
quently encountered example includes newly pub-
lished research papers that have no cited contexts.
Figure 6: Performance when using only cited /
only citing / or both citation contexts.
In this case, it is important to know how our
method performs when we only have one type of
citation contexts. Figure 6 shows the difference in
performance when using: (1) only cited contexts,
(2) only citing contexts, and (3) both context types.
Note that the content view remains the same across
all three experiments.
The plot is showing that citing contexts are
bringing in a significantly higher margin of knowl-
edge compared with cited contexts. This is consis-
tent over different training set sizes, as shown in
the figure, with a more prominent impact when a
small training size is used, i.e. 5-30%. The fact
that the citing contexts achieve higher F1-score
than cited contexts is consistent with the intuition
that when citing a paper y, an author generally
summarizes the main ideas from y using impor-
tant words from a target paper x, making the citing
contexts to have higher overlap with words from x.
In turn, a paper z that cites x may use paraphras-
ing to summarize ideas from x with words more
similar to those from the content of z.
When the two types of contexts are used, co-
training achieves higher results compared with
cases when only one context type is used. This
experiment shows that our method can be applied
for both old and new research articles. Citing con-
texts will be available in the text of the target paper
and are independent of the existence of the cited
contexts.
5.3 Informative Features
What are the most informative words from each
view: document content and citation contexts?
Figure 7 shows the words from each view that are
most useful for our topic classification task. The
larger the word, the more informative is for our

task. To determine the informativeness of a word,
we used its Information Gain score. For these ex-
periments, we used training sets consisting of 30%
of the instances, setting in which we achieved the
best results on the validation and test sets using
our proposed co-training approach.
As can be seen, the two word clouds have a
high word overlap. Words such as agent, database
or query are almost equally important in the two
views, dominating both clouds. However, differ-
ences can be observed. For example, words like
learning, multi-agent or interface are more impor-
tant in the content view. On the other hand, words
such as document or text achieve a higher informa-
tion gain score for the citation contexts view.
5.4 Co-Training vs. All Other Approaches
Table 2 summarizes the results obtained by all the
baselines used so far, in comparison with our pro-
posed co-training method. For this experiment, we
show the training percentage used, the precision,
recall and F1-score for each method, in the set-
ting in which it returned the best results. All mea-
sures were averaged after 10 runs with 10 different
seeds.
The results in Table 2 show that the pro-
posed co-training method outperforms all com-
pared models, reaching the highest F1-score of
0.742, while using the smallest amount of la-
beled documents, i.e. 30%. Using only the cit-
ing contexts, the performance is similar to that
of co-training when both context types are used.
However, using only the cited contexts, the per-
formance decreases compared to that of the full
model that uses both context types. We see that
the citing contexts perform better, reaching an
F1-score value of 0.740 compared against 0.714
when only cited contexts are used. Moreover, the
method that uses only the citing contexts is using
10% less labeled data.
Self-training and EM show decreased perfor-
mance compared with co-training. Late Fusion
outperforms Early Fusion, i.e., 0.738 vs. 0.714,
both obtaining lower results than co-training,
while using significantly more labeled data.
2364
The last two lines of the table show the results
when all documents (except those in the valida-
tion and test), are used for training, in a supervised
framework. As can be seen, a supervised method
that uses only citations will achieve a higher per-
formance, compared against a method that uses
titles and abstracts. Nonetheless, co-training ob-
tains higher results than both fully supervised ap-
proaches, while using only 30% of the labeled
data.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we studied the problem of using ci-
tation contexts in order to predict more accurately
the topic of a research article. We showed that a
co-training technique, which uses the paper con-
tent and its citation contexts as two conditionally
independent and sufficient views of the data, can
effectively incorporate cheap, unlabeled data to
improve the classification performance and to re-
duce the need of labeled examples to only a frac-
tion. The results of the experiments showed that
the proposed approach performs better than other
semi-supervised and supervised methods.
This study also shows that citation contexts are
rich sources of information that can be success-
fully used in various IR and NLP tasks. We
showed that document content and citation con-
texts unified under the same algorithm can dra-
matically decrease the annotation costs as well.
In the future, we plan to extend co-training to in-
clude active learning for more robust classifica-
tion. Moreover, it would be interesting to extend
the co-training approach to multi-views that could
potentially handle more than two feature spaces,
e.g., it could include topics by Latent Dirichlet Al-
location (Blei et al., 2003) as an additional view.
