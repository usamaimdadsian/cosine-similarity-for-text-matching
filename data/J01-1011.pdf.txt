"MIT CogNet is an important new venture that brings together many 
different resources for the cognitive and brain sciences. By bringing 
information directly to researchers and students and allowing rapid 
dissemination of important new research directions, CogNet by- 
passes the slow and expensive efforts in the commercial publishing 
world. A new model for how scientific publishing will look in the 
twenty-first century is already being tested today in CogNet~'

While respecting its historical link with the field of MT, Machine 
Translation is changing and broadening its scope of interest to 
encompass all branches of Computational Linguistics and Lan- 
guage Engineering, wherever they incorporate a MULTILINGUAL 
aspect. We therefore welcome submissions to the journal on 
THEORETICAL, DESCRIPTIVE OR COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS 
of any of the following topics: 
+ machine translation and machine-aided translation + human 
translation theory and practise + multilingual text composition and 
generation + multilingual information retrieval + multilingual natural 
language interfaces + multilingual dialogue systems + multilingual 
message understanding systems + corpus-based and statistical 
language modelling + connectionist approaches to translation 
+ compilation and use of bi- and multilingual corpora + discourse 
phenomena and their treatment in (human or machine) translation 
+ knowledge engineering + contrastive linguistics + morphology, 
syntax, semantics, pragmatics + computer-aided language 
instruction and learning + software localization and 
internationalization +speech processing, especially for speech 
translation + phonetics, phonology + computational implications of 
non-Roman character sets + multilingual word-processing 
+ the multilingual information society (sociological and legal as well 
as linguistic aspects) + minority languages + history of machine 
translation. We would also welcome your suggestions about other 
features you would like to see in this journal, for example, special 
issues, squibs, topical comment.

Guidelines for Submissions 
Submissions may be made in any of the following categories: Papers (Short or Long), Letters to 
the Editor, Squibs and Discussions): 
Papers report significant new research results in computational linguistics. Each paper is re- 
viewed by at least two experts in the field. The submission of an article to CL for refereeing 
means that it has not been copyrighted, has not been published in or submitted for publication 
to another efereed archival publication, and has not appeared in any conference or workshop 
proceedings. The submitted manuscript must be available for peer review without restriction. 
If any version of the paper has appeared, or will appear, in any other publication,, the details of 
such publication must be made known to the Editor at the time of submission. The final version 
of a paper tentatively accepted for publication must be accompanied by a Copyright Transfer 
Agreement signed by all of the authors or, in the case of a "work for hire," by the employer. 
This written transfer is necessary under the 1978 U.S. Copyright law. 
Manuscripts for Computational Linguistics should be submitted on letter-size paper (8.5 by 
11 inches, or A4), double-spaced throughout, including footnotes and references. The paper 
should begin with an informative abstract of approximately 150-250 words. Manuscripts must 
be written in English. Guidelines for electronic submission and style files are available from 
http://www.aclweb.org/cl/. Submissions should be specified by the submitter as a submission 
to one of two categories, Short Papers or Long Papers, and must include word counts. Papers 
in these two categories will be reviewed by slightly different procedures: 
Short Papers, of no more than 15 journal pages (about 4000 words), will receive xpedited review 
by two reviewers. Such a paper might, for example, contain adescription of a single experiment, 
algorithm, or other technical result. Authors whose papers are accepted are expected to submit 
final versions within 8 weeks of notification. 
Long Papers, exceeding 15 journal pages, will receive standard review. Such a longer paper 
might, for example, describe the results of a large research project or dissertation. These sub- 
missions hould normally not exceed 30 journal pages (about 8000 words). 
All submissions, regardiess of length, will be held to the same standards of technical and pre- 
sentation quality. 
Letters to the Editor: This category includes statements of opinion on issues relevant o the 
readership. The Editor and the editorial board will evaluate the appropriateness of these con- 
tributions for inclusion. 
For hard copy submissions, five copies of papers or three copies of letters hould be sent to:

Founded in 1962, the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary scientific and 
professional society for natural language processing research and applications. A European chapter was 
established in 1982 and a North American chapter was established in 1999. Besides publishing 
Computational Linguistics, the ACL holds international meetings annually as well as sponsoring 
frequently-held European and North American chapter meetings where the state-of-the-art in natural 
language processing research and development is presented. Special interest groups on the Mathematics 
of Language, the Lexicon, Parsing, Generation, Computational Phonology, Multimedia Language 
Processing, Very Large Corpora, Natural Language Learning, and Dialogue Processing have been formed 
others are likely to be added.
