Student Research Workshop

Preface to the Student Research Workshop 
This was the inaugural year of the Student Research Workshop, which remodeled the traditional student session into a new 
format hat allows students to present their research to a panel of scientific advisors in addition to the audience of workshop 
attendees. Panelists have an opportunity to prepare questions and comments prior to the workshop, so we hope this format 
will provide student authors with more detailed feedback and suggestions for further development of their research than 
would be possible in the traditional setting. The new format also allows a longer time for presentations (25 minutes) and 
for discussion of each paper by the panelists and audience members (15 minutes). We received 18 submissions and 
accepted 8 (44%) for inclusion in the workshop. These papers describe original unpublished work in progress in which all 
authors are students.

Mary Harper, Purdue University (USA) 
Eduard Hovy, USC Information Sciences Institute (USA) 
James Lester, North Carolina State University (USA) 
Scott Miller, BBN Technologies (USA) 
Donia Scott, University of Brighton (UK)

We would like to acknowledge and thank Mary Harper, our Faculty Advisor and also the Principal Investigator n the NSF 
grant, for her considerable help and advice. We received much helpful guidance from the ACL Executive Board and the

the National Science Foundation for their generous upport of this workshop under grant number 0001350-IIS. 1 The NSF 
grant allowed students who might have had no other means of support o travel to the workshop and interact with the 
scientific ommunity.
