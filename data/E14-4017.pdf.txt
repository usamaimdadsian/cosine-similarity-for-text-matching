Abstract
We discuss data-driven morphological
segmentation, in which word forms are
segmented into morphs, that is the surface
forms of morphemes. We extend a re-
cent segmentation approach based on con-
ditional random fields from purely super-
vised to semi-supervised learning by ex-
ploiting available unsupervised segmenta-
tion techniques. We integrate the unsu-
pervised techniques into the conditional
random field model via feature set aug-
mentation. Experiments on three di-
verse languages show that this straight-
forward semi-supervised extension greatly
improves the segmentation accuracy of the
purely supervised CRFs in a computation-
ally efficient manner.
1 Introduction
We discuss data-driven morphological segmenta-
tion, in which word forms are segmented into
morphs, the surface forms of morphemes. This
type of morphological analysis can be useful for
alleviating language model sparsity inherent to
morphologically rich languages (Hirsimäki et al.,
2006; Creutz et al., 2007; Turunen and Kurimo,
2011; Luong et al., 2013). Particularly, we focus
on a low-resource learning setting, in which only
a small amount of annotated word forms are avail-
able for model training, while unannotated word
forms are available in abundance.
We study morphological segmentation using
conditional random fields (CRFs), a discrimina-
tive model for sequential tagging and segmenta-
tion (Lafferty et al., 2001). Recently, Ruoko-
lainen et al. (2013) showed that the CRFs can
yield competitive segmentation accuracy com-
pared to more complex, previous state-of-the-
art techniques. While CRFs yielded generally
the highest accuracy compared to their reference
methods (Poon et al., 2009; Kohonen et al., 2010),
on the smallest considered annotated data sets of
100 word forms, they were outperformed by the
semi-supervised Morfessor algorithm (Kohonen et
al., 2010). However, Ruokolainen et al. (2013)
trained the CRFs solely on the annotated data,
without any use of the available unannotated data.
In this work, we extend the CRF-based ap-
proach to leverage unannotated data in a straight-
forward and computationally efficient manner via
feature set augmentation, utilizing predictions of
unsupervised segmentation algorithms. Experi-
ments on three diverse languages show that the
semi-supervised extension substantially improves
the segmentation accuracy of the CRFs. The ex-
tension also provides higher accuracies on all the
considered data set sizes and languages compared
to the semi-supervised Morfessor (Kohonen et al.,
2010).
In addition to feature set augmentation, there
exists numerous approaches for semi-supervised
CRF model estimation, exemplified by minimum
entropy regularization (Jiao et al., 2006), gen-
eralized expectations criteria (Mann and McCal-
lum, 2008), and posterior regularization (He et al.,
2013). In this work, we employ the feature-based
approach due to its simplicity and the availabil-
ity of useful unsupervised segmentation methods.
Varying feature set augmentation approaches have
been successfully applied in several related tasks,
such as Chinese word segmentation (Wang et al.,
2011; Sun and Xu, 2011) and chunking (Turian et
al., 2010).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we describe the CRF-based morphological seg-
mentation approach following (Ruokolainen et al.,
2013), and then show how to extend this approach
to leverage unannotated data in an efficient man-
ner. Our experimental setup and results are dis-
cussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally,
84
we present conclusions on the work in Section 5.
2 Methods
2.1 Supervised Morphological Segmentation
using CRFs
We present the morphological segmentation task
as a sequential labeling problem by assigning each
character to one of three classes, namely {be-
ginning of a multi-character morph (B), middle
of a multi-character morph (M), single character
morph (S)}. We then perform the sequential label-
ing using linear-chain CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001).
Formally, the linear-chain CRF model distribu-
tion for label sequence y = (y
1
, y
2
, . . . , y
T
) and
a word form x = (x
1
, x
2
, . . . , x
T
) is written as a
conditional probability
p (y |x;w) ?
T
?
t=2
exp
(
w · ?(y
t?1
, y
t
, x, t)
)
,
(1)
where t indexes the character positions,w denotes
the model parameter vector, and ? the vector-
valued feature extracting function. The model pa-
rameters w are estimated discrimatively based on
a training set of exemplar input-output pairs (x, y)
using, for example, the averaged perceptron algo-
rithm (Collins, 2002). Subsequent to estimation,
the CRF model segments test word forms using
the Viterbi algorithm (Lafferty et al., 2001).
We next describe the feature set
{?
i
(y
t?1
, y
t
, x, t)}
|?|
i=1
by defining emission
and transition features. Denoting the label set {B,
M, S} as Y , the emission feature set is defined as
{?
m
(x, t)1(y
t
= y
?
t
) |m ? 1..M ,?y
?
t
? Y} ,
(2)
where the indicator function 1(y
t
= y
?
t
) returns
one if and only if y
t
= y
?
t
and zero otherwise, that
is
1(y
t
= y
?
t
) =
{
1 if y
t
= y
?
t
0 otherwise
, (3)
and {?
m
(x, t)}
M
m=1
is the set of functions describ-
ing the character position t. Following Ruoko-
lainen et al. (2013), we employ binary functions
that describe the position t of word x using all left
and right substrings up to a maximum length ?.
The maximum substring length ?
max
is considered
a hyper-parameter to be adjusted using a develop-
ment set. While the emission features associate
the input to labels, the transition feature set
{1(y
t?1
= y
?
t?1
)1(y
t
= y
?
t
) | y
?
t
, y
?
t?1
? Y} (4)
captures the dependencies between adjacent labels
as irrespective of the input x.
2.2 Leveraging Unannotated Data
In order to utilize unannotated data, we explore a
straightforward approach based on feature set aug-
mentation. We exploit predictions of unsupervised
segmentation algorithms by defining variants of
the features described in Section 2.1. The idea is
to compensate the weaknesses of the CRF model
trained on the small annotated data set using the
strengths of the unsupervised methods that learn
from large amounts of unannotated data.
For example, consider utilizing predictions of
the unsupervised Morfessor algorithm (Creutz and
Lagus, 2007) in the CRF model. In order to ac-
complish this, we first learn the Morfessor model
from the unannotated training data, and then ap-
ply the learned model on the word forms in the
annotated training set. Assuming the annotated
training data includes the English word drivers,
the Morfessor algorithm might, for instance, re-
turn a (partially correct) segmentation driv + ers.
We present this segmentation by defining a func-
tion ?(t), which returns 0 or 1, if the position t is
in the middle of a segment or in the beginning of a
segment, respectively, as in
t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
x
t
d r i v e r s
?(t) 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
Now, given a set of U functions {?
u
(t)}
U
u=1
, we
define variants of the emission features in (2) as
{?
u
(x, t)?
m
(x, t)1(y
t
= y
?
t
) |
?u ? 1..U ,?m ? 1..M ,?y
?
t
? Y} . (5)
By adding the expanded features of form (5), the
CRF model learns to associate the output of the
unsupervised algorithms in relation to the sur-
rounding substring context. Similarly, an ex-
panded transition feature is written as
{?
u
(x, t)1(y
t?1
= y
?
t?1
)1(y
t
= y
?
t
) |
?u ? 1..U ,?y
?
t
, y
?
t?1
? Y} . (6)
After defining the augmented feature set, the
CRF model parameters can be estimated in a stan-
dard manner on the small, annotated training data
set. Subsequent to CRF training, the Morfessor
model is applied on the test instances in order to
allow the feature set augmentation and standard
decoding with the estimated CRF model. We ex-
pect the Morfessor features to specifically improve
85
segmentation of compound words (for example,
brain+storm), which are modeled with high ac-
curacy by the unsupervised Morfessor algorithm
(Creutz and Lagus, 2007), but can not be learned
from the small number of annotated examples
available for the supervised CRF training.
As another example of a means to augment the
feature set, we make use of the fact that the output
of the unsupervised algorithms does not have to be
binary (zeros and ones). To this end, we employ
the classic letter successor variety (LSV) scores
presented originally by (Harris, 1955).
1
The LSV
scores utilize the insight that the predictability of
successive letters should be high within morph
segments, and low at the boundaries. Conse-
quently, a high variety of letters following a prefix
indicates a high probability of a boundary. We use
a variant of the LSV values presented by Çöltekin
(2010), in which we first normalize the scores by
the average score at each position t, and subse-
qently logarithmize the normalized value. While
LSV score tracks predictability given prefixes, the
same idea can be utilized for suffixes, providing
the letter predecessor variety (LPV). Subsequent
to augmenting the feature set using the functions
LSV (t) and LPV (t), the CRF model learns to
associate high successor and predecessor values
(low predictability) to high probability of a seg-
ment boundary. Appealingly, the Harris features
can be obtained in a computationally inexpensive
manner, as they merely require counting statistics
from the unannotated data.
The feature set augmentation approach de-
scribed above is computationally efficient, if the
computational overhead from the unsupervised
methods is small. This is because the CRF param-
eter estimation is still based on the small amount
of labeled examples as described in Section 2.1,
while the number of features incorporated in the
CRF model (equal to the number of parameters)
grows linearly in the number of exploited unsu-
pervised algorithms.
3 Experimental Setup
3.1 Data
We perform the experiments on the Morpho Chal-
lenge 2009/2010 data set (Kurimo et al., 2009; Ku-

We also experimented on modifying the output of the
Morfessor algorithm from binary to probabilistic, but these
soft cues provided no consistent advantage over the standard
binary output.

morphological segmentations in English, Finnish
and Turkish. We follow the experiment setup, in-
cluding data partitions and evaluation metrics, de-
scribed by Ruokolainen et al. (2013). Table 1
shows the total number of instances available for
model estimation and testing.
3.2 CRF Feature Extraction and Training
The substring features included in the CRF model
are described in Section 2.1. We include all sub-
strings which occur in the training data. The Mor-
fessor and Harris (successor and predecessor va-
riety) features employed by the semi-supervised
extension are described in Section 2.2. We ex-
perimented on two variants of the Morfessor al-
gorithm, namely, the Morfessor Baseline (Creutz
and Lagus, 2002) and Morfessor Categories-MAP
(Creutz and Lagus, 2005), CatMAP for short. The
Baseline models were trained on word types and
the perplexity thresholds of the CatMAP models
were set equivalently to the reference runs in Mor-
pho Challenge 2010 (English: 450, Finnish: 250,
Turkish: 100); otherwise the default parameters
were used. The Harris features do not require any
hyper-parameters.
The CRF model (supervised and semi-
supervised) is trained using the averaged
perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002). The num-
ber of passes over the training set made by the
perceptron algorithm, and the maximum length of
substring features are optimized on the held-out
development sets.
The experiments are run on a standard desktop
computer using a Python-based single-threaded
CRF implementation. For Morfessor Baseline, we
use the recently published implementation by Vir-
pioja et al. (2013). For Morfessor CatMAP, we
used the Perl implementation by Creutz and La-
gus (2005).

3.3 Reference Methods
We compare our method’s performance with
the fully supervised CRF model and the semi-
supervised Morfessor algorithm (Kohonen et al.,
2010). For semi-supervised Morfessor, we use the
Python implementation by Virpioja et al. (2013).
4 Results
Segmentation accuracies for all languages are pre-
sented in Table 2. The columns titled Train (ann.)
and Train (unann.) denote the number of anno-
tated and unannotated training instances utilized
by the method, respectively. To summarize, the
semi-supervised CRF extension greatly improved
the segmentation accuracy of the purely super-
vised CRFs, and also provided higher accuracies
compared to the semi-supervised Morfessor algo-
rithm
2
.
Appealingly, the semi-supervised CRF exten-
sion already provided consistent improvement
over the supervised CRFs, when utilizing the com-
putationally inexpensive Harris features. Addi-
tional gains were then obtained using the Morfes-
sor features. On all languages, highest accuracies
were obtained using a combination of Harris and
CatMAP features.
Running the CRF parameter estimation (includ-
ing hyper-parameters) consumed typically up to a
few minutes. Computing statistics for the Harris
features also took up roughly a few minutes on
all languages. Learning the unsupervised Mor-
fessor algorithm consumed 3, 47, and 20 min-
utes for English, Finnish, and Turkish, respec-
tively. Meanwhile, CatMAP model estimation
was considerably slower, consuming roughly 10,
50, and 7 hours for English, Finnish and Turkish,
respectively. Training and decoding with semi-
supervised Morfessor took 21, 111, and 47 hours
for English, Finnish and Turkish, respectively.
5 Conclusions
We extended a recent morphological segmenta-
tion approach based on CRFs from purely super-
vised to semi-supervised learning. We accom-
plished this in an efficient manner using feature set
augmentation and available unsupervised segmen-
tation techniques. Experiments on three diverse
