Abstract
We present an approach for extractive
single-document summarization. Our ap-
proach is based on a weighted graphical
representation of documents obtained by
topic modeling. We optimize importance,
coherence and non-redundancy simulta-
neously using ILP. We compare ROUGE
scores of our system with state-of-the-art
results on scientific articles from PLOS
Medicine and on DUC 2002 data. Hu-
man judges evaluate the coherence of sum-
maries generated by our system in com-
parision to two baselines. Our approach
obtains competitive performance.
1 Introduction
Summarization systems take a long document as
input and generate a concise document as out-
put. Several summarization variants exist such as
generic, query-based, multi-document and single
document, but the basic requirements for summa-
rization remain the same. Summaries should con-
tain salient information so that the reader will not
miss anything from the original document. Also,
the reader is not interested in repetitive informa-
tion, so summaries should not include redundant
information. Finally, summaries should be coher-
ent and of high readability.
We introduce a completely unsupervised graph-
based summarization using latent drichlet alloca-
tion (LDA, Blei and Lafferty (2009)). LDA is
a simple model for topic modeling where topic
probabilities are assigned words in documents.
The probabilities can be used to measure the se-
mantic relatedness between words and hence the
topical coherence of a document. We use topi-
cal coherence as a means to ensure the coherence
of extractive single-document summaries. Re-
mus and Biemann (2013) apply LDA to compute
lexical chains while Gorinski and Lapata (2015)
also develop a graph-based summarization system
which takes coherence into account.
Our work is based on the bipartite entity graph
introduced by Guinaudeau and Strube (2013).
However, in their graph one set of nodes corre-
sponds to entities whereas in our graph it corre-
sponds to topics. The entity graph has already
been used by Parveen and Strube (2015) for sum-
marization. Their graph is unweighted and sparse,
whereas our topical graph is weighted and dense.
We apply our topical graph on the dataset in-
troduced by Parveen and Strube (2015). This
dataset contains scientific articles from the jour-
nal PLOS Medicine
1
. Every PLOS Medicine ar-
ticle is accompanied by an editor’s summary and
an authors’ abstract. We use both as gold sum-
maries for evaluation. Results obtained on the
PLOS Medicine dataset using the topical graph are
as good as using the entity graph and significantly
better than several baselines and the graph-based
system TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). We
use the DUC 2002 dataset to compare our results
with state-of-the-art techniques. In contrast to the
PLOS Medicine data the DUC 2002 dataset con-
tains very small articles. Still, our technique gives
comparable results to the state-of-the-art. This
shows that our technique is flexible and scalable
despite being unsupervised.
2 Our Method
2.1 Document Representation
A graph-based representation has been used
by well known summarization systems such as
LexRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) and TextRank
(Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004). The graph used by
both is of one mode type where sentences are
nodes which are connected by weighted edges.
1
http://journals.plos.org/
plosmedicine/
1949
Weights express sentence similarity.
We use a bipartite graph representation of doc-
uments (Figure 1). The bipartite graph, G =
(V
s
, V
t
, E
t,s
), has two sets of nodes where V
s
rep-
resents sentences and V
t
topics. The two sets of
nodes are connected with edge E
t,s
, if a word in a
sentence s is present in a topic t. If multiple words
are present in topic t of sentence s, then the edge
weight is the logarithmic sum of probabilities of
words in topic t. We normalize the edge weight by
dividing them by the length of the sentence. Hence
long sentences will not benefit from their lengths.
We call the resulting graph topical graph.
2.2 Sentence Ranking
The final summary should contain only important
sentences. Therefore, we give a score to every
sentence in a document to obtain important sen-
tences. Following Parveen and Strube (2015) we
apply the HITS (Hyperlink Induced Topic Search)
(Kleinberg, 1999) algorithm for ranking sentences
by importance, since our graph is a bipartite graph.
It puts nodes of a graph in two sets: hub nodes and
authority nodes.
For the HITS algorithm the rank of nodes needs
to be initialized. We initialize the topic rank
Rank
t
i
= 1 and the sentence rank Rank
s
i
=
1+sim(s
i
, title). The title in the sentence rank is
the title of the article. sim(s
i
, title) is the cosine
similarity between the sentence s
i
and the title of
the article. After initialization of all nodes in the
weighted topical graph, the HITS algorithm is ap-
plied to obtain ranks of sentences.
2.3 Coherence Measure
Guinaudeau and Strube (2013) represent a docu-
ment by the entity graph, a bipartite graph consist-
ing of sentence and entity nodes. They perform
a one-mode projection on sentence nodes, com-
pute the coherence of a document on the basis of
the one-mode projections and use the coherence
measure for summary coherence rating. Building
upon this work, Parveen and Strube (2015) inte-
grate this coherence measure to directly generate
coherent summaries. Instead of the entity graph
we here use the topical graph to incorporate the co-
herence measure. Parveen and Strube (2015) use
an unweighted projection graph whereas we use
a weighted projection graph of a topical graph to
compute the coherence. The weighted one mode
projection of the topical graph is shown in Figure
1, bottom right.
weighted coh(s
i
, P ) = weighted Outdegree(s
i
, P )
(1)
norm weighted coh(s
i
, P ) =
weighted coh(s
i
, P )
?
weighted coh(s
i
, P )
(2)
Equation 1 calculates the outdegree of every sen-
tence from the weighted projection graph. How-
ever weighted coh(s
i
, P ) in Equation 1 is not
a normalized value. The normalized coherence
value is in Equation 2. Afterwards, we use this
coherence value in the optimization phase for the
selection of sentences.
2.4 Optimization
McDonald (2007) introduces summarization as an
optimization task which takes care of importance,
redundancy and coherence simultaneously. In this
paper, we also propose a model for single doc-
ument summarization which is based on integer
linear programming (ILP). We consider ranks ob-
tained by the HITS algorithm as sentence impor-
tance. The weighted coherence measure is cal-
culated using Equation 1 and Equation 2. PLOS
Medicine articles are very long and contain repeti-
tive information, so we have to deal with redun-
dancy even in single-document summarization.
Therefore we model non-redundancy as topic cov-
erage in the final summary: the more topics in a
summary, the less redundant the summary will be.
The ILP objective function is shown in Equation
3. f
i
(X) is the function which maximizes im-
portance, f
c
(X) maximizes coherence, and f
t
(Y )
maximizes topic coverage.
Objective function : max
X,Y
(f
i
(X) + f
c
(X) + f
t

(3)
X is a variable for sentences which contains
boolean variables x
i
, where 0 < i < n is the num-
ber of sentences. Y is a variable for topics which
contains boolean variables y
j
, where 0 < j < m
is the number of topics.

The final summary should be shorter than the
original text and it should also have a length limit
(Equation 5). The results on PLOS medicine data
(Section 3) are limited to 5 sentences. We have
also experimented with multiple lengths. Increas-
ing the summary length increases ROUGE scores.
DUC 2002 summaries are limited to 100 words.
Equation 6 shows that topics present in sen-
tence x
i
are selected, when sentence x
i
is selected.
Therefore, x
i
= 1 and T
i
= Topics
x
i
. The con-
straint holds, because
?
j?T
i
y
j
= |Topics
x
i
|. Fur-
thermore, if sentence x
i
= 0, i.e., it is not se-
lected, then there must be topics which are al-
ready present in selected sentences. Hence, the
constraint holds,
?
j?T
i
y
j
? 0.
Equation 7 constrains the selection of topics. If
topic y
j
= 1, then at least one sentence containing
this topic has been selected. Therefore
?
i?S
j
x
i
? 1,
and the constraint holds. If topic y
j
= 0, then
sentences containing this topic are not selected, so
?
i?S
j
x
i
= 0, and the constraint holds.
3 Experiments
Following Parveen and Strube (2015), we evaluate
on the science genre, i.e. PLOS Medicine articles,
and on the news genre, i.e. DUC 2002 data.
3.1 Datasets
PLOS Medicine articles are considerably longer
than DUC 2002 documents. The average num-
ber of sentences per document is 154 in PLOS
Medicine and 25 in DUC 2002. Benefits of using
PLOS Medicine articles for experiments are:
• They are accompanied by an authors’ abstract.
• They have a summary written by an editor.
• They are formatted in XML.
• They contain explicit full forms of abbrevia-
tions.
Editor’s summaries have a different perspective,
writing style and length than authors’ abstracts.
We use both as gold summaries for evaluation.
Following Parveen and Strube (2015) we re-
port the results using editor’s summaries and au-
thor’s abstracts independently. To compare with
the state-of-the-art in single-document summa-
rization, we also evaluate on DUC 2002 data.
1951
3.2 Experimental Setup
We use the XML version of PLOS Medicine ar-
ticles. We extract the contents excluding figures,
tables and references. Editor’s summary and au-
thors’ abstract are separated from the content for
evaluation. The PLOS Medicine XML provides
explicit full forms when abbreviations are intro-
duced. We replace abbreviations with their full
form in the summary. We then remove non-
alphabetical characters. After this we parse ar-
ticles using the Stanford parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003). We perform pronoun resolution using
the coreference resolution system by Martschat
(2013)
2
. We use gensim to generate the topics.
For generating topics we use a dataset contain-
ing scientific articles from biology, which con-
tains 221,385 documents and about 50 million
sentences
3
. We also use Wikipedia to compare
with topics from a general domain.
The HITS algorithm is applied on the bipar-
tite graph for computing sentence importance. We
calculate the coherence values of sentences on
weighted one-mode projection graphs. The impor-
tance and coherence of a sentence is used in the
optimization phase
4
which returns a binary value
for each sentence.
3.3 Results
Results on PLOS Medicine are shown in Tables
1 and 2. We evaluate using ROUGE-SU4 and
ROUGE-2 (Lin, 2004). We limit the length of
the summaries to five sentences and the number
of topics to 2000 in the topical graph. We also
experimented with varying numbers of topics, i.e.
500, 1000 and 2000, and varying summary length
limits. The results changed only marginally. The
general trends remained the same.
We compare our system with four different
baselines and two versions of the entity graph.
Lead selects the top five sentences, Random five
sentences randomly. MMR is an implementation
of maximal marginal relevance (Carbonell and
Goldstein, 1998). TextRank is the graph-based
system by Mihalcea and Tarau (2004)
5
. Egraph
is the entity graph based system by Parveen and
Strube (2015). Egraph + Coh. is their system

which includes a coherence measure, which is cal-
culated by using the unweighted projection graph.
Egraph + Coh. + Pos. combines the coherence
measure and positional information.
Our system outperforms all baselines substan-
tially, as shown in Tables 1 (editor’s summaries)
and 2 (authors’ abstracts). We observe improve-
ments in the results when including coherence in
the topical graph. We obtain best results with
Tgraph + Coh., where the number of topics is
2000. In Tgraph, penalizing coherence mea-
sures with positional information lowers ROUGE
scores. While including positional information
into the entity graph obtains the best results on
the PLOS Medicine dataset, positional informa-
tion does not appear to be beneficial for the topical
graph. Absolute ROUGE scores are higher when
using abstracts as gold summaries, because the ab-
stracts are shorter than editor’s summaries.
We compare results using biology journals (Ta-
ble 3) and Wikipedia (Table 4) to generate top-
ics. The topical graph is denser when using bi-
ology journals compared to the graph generated
from Wikipedia. Results using the in-domain bi-
ology journals as data to generate topics are better
than using general domain Wikipedia data. The
scores are highest with 2000 topics. For Bio topic
the differences are negligible, however.
We also compare results on DUC 2002 to
1952

check against the state-of-the-art on a well-known
dataset. Lead performs well on DUC 2002 as
shown in Table 5, because important information
appears in the initial lines of news articles. DUC
2002 Best is the result reported by the top perform-
ing system at DUC 2002. This system actually
obtains better results than TextRank (Mihalcea and
Tarau, 2004) and the more recent system Uniform-
Link (Wan and Xiao, 2010). Our system Tgraph
+ Coh. performs better than the well known best
systems on DUC 2002 and slightly better than
Egraph + Coh. However the difference between
the results of Tgraph and Egraph are not signifi-
cant. In contrast to the entity graph based system,
the coherence measure in our system is calculated
by using a topic-based weighted projection graph,
which is denser and hence more informative.
3.4 Human Coherence Judgements
In addition to ROUGE scores, we use human
judgements for evaluating the coherence of our
summaries. We asked four PhD students in natural
language processing to evaluate our summaries on
the basis of coherence. We randomly selected ten
summaries of scientific articles from three differ-
ent systems, TextRank, Lead and Tgraph + Coh.
We asked the human judges to rank the summaries
according to their coherence. So, the summary
Systems R-1 R-2 R-SU4
Lead 0.459 0.180 0.201
DUC 2002 Best 0.480 0.228
TextRank 0.470 0.195 0.217
UniformLink (k = 10) 0.471 0.201
Egraph + Coh. 0.479 0.238 0.230
Tgraph (n=2000) + Coh. 0.481 0.243 0.242
Table 5: DUC 2002, single-document summariza-
tion
which is best in coherence gets rank 1, second best
gets rank 2, and worst gets rank 3. We calculated
the Kendall concordance coefficient (W ) (Siegel
and Castellan, 1988) to measure the judges’ agree-
ment. We obtain W = 0.61, which indicates a
relatively high agreement.
To compare the three systems, we take the aver-
age over the ranks. The overall rank of TextRank
is 2.625, Lead is 1.675 and Tgraph + Coh. is 1.8.
Lead performs best, because it selects the top five
consecutive sentences, which are coherent as the
original authors intended them to be. However, the
overall ranks of Lead and Tgraph + Coh. are not
significantly different, whereas TextRank’s over-
all rank is significantly worse than both. Hence,
Tgraph + Coh. performs very well in our human
judgement coherence experiment.
4 Discussion
In this paper we introduced the topical graph
for single document summarization. We experi-
mented with multiple numbers of topics on the sci-
entific article dataset. Our system performs well
when including the weighted coherence measure
in the optimization phase. The results are compa-
rable with the entity graph. However, the entity
graph is less informative and very sparse as com-
pared to the topical graph. Our system does not
need annotated training data and, except for the
number of topics, no optimization of parameters.
Hence, we consider it unsupervised.
