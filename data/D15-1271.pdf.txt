Abstract
Domain adaptation is a challenge for super-
vised NLP systems because of expensive
and time-consuming manual annotated re-
sources. We present a novel method to
adapt a supervised coreference resolution
system trained on newswire to short narra-
tive stories without retraining the system.
The idea is to perform inference via an In-
teger Linear Programming (ILP) formula-
tion with the features of narratives adopted
as soft constraints. When testing on the
UMIREC
1
and N2
2
corpora with the-state-
of-the-art Berkeley coreference resolution
system trained on OntoNotes
3
, our infer-
ence substantially outperforms the original
inference on the CoNLL 2011 metric.
1 Introduction
Coreference resolution is the task of partitioning
the set of mentions of discourse referents in a text
into classes (or ‘chains’) corresponding to those
referents (Stede, 2011). To solve the problem, con-
textual and grammatical clues, as well as semantic
information and world knowledge are necessary for
either learning-based (Bengtson and Roth, 2008;
Stoyanov et al., 2010; Haghighi and Klein, 2010)
or rule-based (Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Lee et al.,
2011) coreference systems. These systems draw on
diverse information sources and complex heuristics
to resolve pronouns, model discourse, determine
anaphoricity, and identify semantically compati-
ble mentions. However, this leads to systems with
many hetorogenous parts that can be difficult to
interpret or modify.
Durrett and Klein (2013) propose a learning-
based, mention-synchronous coreference system to

tackle the various aspects of coreference by using
the simplest possible set of features. Its advantage
is that the system can both implicitly model impor-
tant linguistic effects and capture other patterns in
the data that are not easily teased out by hand. With
a simple set of features including head/first/last
words, preceding/following words, length, exact
string match, head match, sentence/mention dis-
tance, gender, number etc. and an efficient training
using conditional log-likelihood augmented with
a parameterized loss function optimization they
report state-of-the-art results on CoNLL 2011 data.
But while CoNLL 2011 training data
(OntoNotes) includes a few different source
domains (newswire, weblogs, etc.), we witness
significant drops in performance when systems
trained on CoNLL 2011 are applied to new target
domains such as narratives. Some linguistic effects
and patterns that are very important for the target
domain were never seen in the source domain on
which the model was trained. In such cases, when
adapting a coreference system to a new domain,
it is necessary to incorporate these more complex
linguistic features and patterns into the model.
We propose a novel method to adopt the tar-
get domain’s features to a supervised coreference
system without retraining the model. We present
a case of transferring the system of (Durrett and
Klein, 2013), which is trained on OntoNotes, to
short narrative stories. The idea is to perform infer-
ence via a linear programming formulation with the
features of narratives adopted as soft constraints.
Since the new features are incorporated only into
the linear program, there is no need to retrain the
original model. Our formulation models three phe-
nomena that are important for short narrative sto-
ries: local discourse coherence, which we model
via centering theory constraints, speaker-listener
relations, which we model via direct speech act con-
straints, and character-naming, which we model via
definite noun phrase and exact match constraints.

We also suggest a method to compute back pointers
(as defined in Durrett and Klein (2013)) globally.
2 Berkeley coreference system
Given N mentions m
1
, ...,m
N
from a document
x, each m
i
has an associated random variable a
i
taking values in the set of {1, ..., i ? 1, NEW}.
This variable specifies m
i
’s selected antecedent or
indicates that it begins a new coreference chain.
We call a
i
the back pointer of m
i
. A setting of
all the back pointers, denoted by a = (a
1
, ..., a
n
),
implies an unique set of coreference chains that
serve as the system output.
A log-linear model of the conditional distribu-
tion P (a|x) ? exp
?
n
i=1
f(i, a
i
, x) is used, where
f(i, a
i
, x) is a feature function that examines the
coreference decision a
i
for m
i
with document con-
text x. If a
i
= NEW , the features indicate the
suitability of the given mention to be anaphoric or
not; when a
i
= j for some j, the features express
aspects of the pairwise linkage, and examine rele-
vant attributes of the anaphor i or the antecedent
j. During training, the model is optimized with a
parameterized loss function. The inference is sim-
ple and efficient: because logP (a|x) decomposes
linearly over mentions, a
i
= argmax
a
i
P (a
i
|x)
(Durrett and Klein, 2013).
3 Computing back pointers globally
A drawback of computing each a
i
locally is that the
system does not take into account constraints from
mentions outside of the (mention, antecedent) pairs.
For example, given three mentions m
1
,m
2
,m
3
, if
the system predicts that a
2
= 1 and a
3
= 2 (i.e.,
that m
2
’s antecedent is m
1
and m
3
’s antecedent
is m
2
), then m
3
will be automatically inferred as
coreferent with m
1
. But if there is a clear clue that
m
1
and m
3
are not coreferent, leveraging this clue
could help avoid the error of linking m
3
to m
2
.
In this work, we perform inference via an ILP
formulation which allows new linguistic features
and patterns over mentions – not only (mention,
antecedent) pairs – that were not part of training
the original model to be adopted as constraints of
the ILP problem.
Let U be the set of binary indicator variables
corresponding to the values assigned to the back
pointers. Specifically, u
ij
= 1 iff a
i
= j and
u
ii
= 1 iff a
i
= NEW .
C is the set of K binary constraint indicator vari-
ables indicating if linguistic constraints are violated.
Specifically, c
k,i,j
= 1 iff the linguistic constraint
C
k
is violated for the back pointer u
ij
. Each C
k
is
associated with a penalty score ?
k
.
We aim to maximize the objective function:
N
?
i=1
i
?
j=1
u
ij
P (a
i
= j|x)?
K
?
k=1
?
k
c
k,i,j
(1)
Subject to:
?i :
i
?
j=1
u
ij
= 1
To incorporate coreference constraints, we intro-
duce V, a set of binary variables indicating if two
mentions are in the same coreference chain. For
each pair of j < i, a variable v
ij
is added to the
ILP model, where v
ij
= 1 iff m
i
and m
j
are in the
same chain. The definition of v
ij
in terms of u
ij
is
encoded as the following ILP constraints:
?j < i : u
ii
+ v
ij
? 1
?j < i : u
ij
? v
ij
? 0
?k < j < i : u
ij
+ v
jk
? v
ik
? 1
?k < j < i : u
ij
? v
jk
+ v
ik
? 1
?j < k < i : u
ij
+ v
kj
? v
ik
? 1
?j < k < i : u
ij
? v
kj
+ v
ik
? 1
For long texts, to reduce the complexity of the ILP
problem, we set a threshold, windows
v
, so that v
ij
is only available if i? windows
v
? j.
The framework of V variables allows corefer-
ence constraints to be adopted easily by any coref-
erence resolution system that provides scores for
each possible back pointer value. For example, con-
sider the Stanford exact string match sieve, which
“requires an exact string match between a mention
and its antecedent” (Lee et al., 2011). If we want to
encourage such matches, for each pair j < i where
the two nominal mentions m
i
and m
j
have an ex-
act string match, we would introduce a constraint
indicator variable c
exact,i,j
and add the constraint
v
ij
+ c
exact,i,j
= 1 to the ILP model. The result
would be that when the exact match constraint is
violated and some v
ij
= 0, ILP would force the cor-
responding c
exact,i,j
= 1 and the objective function
would be reduced by ?
exact
.
ILP has been used previously to enforce global
consistency in coreference resolution (Finkel and
Manning, 2008; Denis and Baldridge, 2007; Barzi-
lay and Lapata, 2006). These models were de-
signed for an all-pairs classification approach to
2263
coreference resolution, and are not directly appli-
cable to the back pointer approach of (Durrett and
Klein, 2013). But the back pointer approach allows
features to be expressed more naturally using local
context, rather than requiring, for example, judg-
ments of whether two pronouns separated by many
paragraphs are coreferent. Moreover, our ILP for-
mulation is the only one to consider the problem of
adapting to another domain and incorporating new
features without retraining the original model.
4 Centering theory constraints
Pronouns, in particular, have a huge effect on in-
formation flow across sentences. Since they are
almost void of meaning (only signal gender and
number of the antecedent), the discourse referent
to be picked up must be particularly salient, so that
it can be readily identified by the reader (Stede,
2011). The discourse center hypothesis (Hudson-
D’Zmura, 1988) states that at any point in discourse
understanding, there is one single entity that is the
most salient discourse referent at that point. This
referent is called the center. Centering theory is
a key element of the discourse center hypothesis
used in anaphora resolution (Grosz et al., 1995).
Beaver (2004) reformulates the centering theory in
terms of Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky,
2004). Six ranked constraints – Agree, Disjoint,
ProTop, FamDef, Cohere and Align – are used to
make anaphora decisions. We adopt four of these
constraints in our ILP model as follows:
Disjoint “Co-arguments of a predicate
4
are dis-
joint.” For each j < i such that m
i
and m
j
are
subject and object arguments of a non-reflexive
predicate, we introduce a constraint indicator vari-
able c
disjoint,i,j
, and add the ILP constraint v
ij
?
c
disjoint,i,j
= 0.
ProTop “The topic of a sentence which is the en-
tity referred to in both the current and the previous
sentence, is pronominalized.” If a sentence con-
tains pronouns then at least one of its pronouns is
coreferent with a mention in the previous sentence.
For each sentence t containing pronouns, we in-
troduce a constraint indicator variable c
protop,t,t?1
,
and add the ILP constraints:
?i ? P
t
, ?j ?M
t?1
: v
ij
+ c
protop,t,t?1
? 1
c
protop,t,t?1
+
?
i?P
t
?
j?M
t?1
v
ij
? 1
4
A word that evokes a semantic frame (event) in a sentence.
P
t
is the set of all pronouns in sentence t. M
t?1
is
the set of all mentions in sentence t? 1
5
.
FamDef “No new information about the refer-
ent is provided by the definite.” We consider only
pronouns here, though the original FamDef also
includes definite descriptions and proper names
(Beaver, 2004). For each pronoun m
i
, we intro-
duce a constraint indicator variable c
famdef,i,i
and
add the ILP constraint u
ii
? c
famdef,i,i
= 0.
Align “The topic is in subject position.” More
specifically, the topic of a sentence is pronominal-
ized and prefers the subject position over other
positions. For each sentence containing only one
pronoun m
i
, if the previous sentence has only one
verbal semantic frame and m
j
is its subject, we
introduce a constraint indicator variable c
align,i,j
,
and add the ILP constraint v
ij
+ c
align,i,j
= 1.
Note: The ProTop, FamDef and Align constraints
are not applied to sentences containing quotations.
5 Direct speech constraints
Direct speech acts (with quotation marks) are de-
tected and attached to the closest verbal commu-
nication semantic frames. For each direct speech
act q
t
, we call the mentions m
st
,m
ot
the speaker
and listener of q
t
if they play the subject and ob-
ject roles respectively in the semantic frame of
q
t
. We detect the set of subject pronouns
6
inside
the quote marks of q
t
and name it S
t
. The set
of all mentions that refer to the speaker of q
t
is
SPEAKER
t
= {m
st
} ? S
t
. For each (m
i
,m
j
) ?
SPEAKER
t
× SPEAKER
t
with i > j, we introduce
a constraint indicator variable c
subject,i,j
, and add
the ILP constraint v
ij
+ c
subject,i,j
= 1.
Similarly, O
t
is the set of object pronouns
7
in-
side the quote marks of q
t
. The set of all men-
tions that refer to the listener of q
t
is LISTENER
t
=
{m
ot
}?O
t
. For each pair of mentions (m
i
,m
j
) ?
LISTENER
t
×LISTENER
t
with i > j, we introduce
a constraint indicator variable c
object,i,j
, and add
the constraint v
ij
+ c
object,i,j
= 1.
If a conversation is detected (a sequence of
“question” and “answer” semantic frames), the sub-
ject of the “question” is coreferent with the object

We can relax the constraint by replacing M

with
M

and add the ILP constraint

+ c

= 1.
6 Definite noun phrase and exact match
constraints
In short narrative stories, characters are frequently
named via proper names, pronouns or definite noun
phrases (Toolan, 2009). Character names are re-
peated regularly over the whole stories. A character
is often first presented as an indefinite noun phrase
(such as “a woman”), then later as a definite noun
phrase (such as “the woman”). In this work we
introduce the definite noun phrase constraint: For
each pair j < i, if m
j
is the indefinite form and m
i
is the definite form of the same noun phrase, to en-
force that m
i
and m
j
are coreferent, we introduce
a constraint indicator variable c
name,i,j
, and add
the ILP constraint v
ij
+c
name,i,j
= 1. To boost the
identification of characters in the stories, the def-
inite noun phrase constraint is used together with
the exact match constraint (See Section 3) applied
to noun phrases and proper nouns.
7 Experiment
We test our model on 30 English folktales from the
UCM/MIT Indications, Referring Expressions, and
Coreference (UMIREC) Corpus v1.1 (Finlayson
and Hervs, 2010), and 64 text stories from the Ha-
dith section of the Narrative Networks (N2) Cor-
pus (Finlayson et al., 2014). The texts are prepro-
cessed using the Stanford sentence splitter (Man-
ning et al., 2014)
8
and the Berkeley coreference
system’s preprocessor. The Berkeley coreference
system is trained on OntoNotes (newswire, broad-

cast news/conversation, and web texts). We use
Gurobi
9
to solve our ILP problem, and the Lund
semantic role labeler (Bj¨orkelund et al., 2009) to
detect semantic frames. Note that in our imple-
mentation, “subject” and “object” used in Sec-
tion 4 and Section 5 refer to “subject role” and
“object role” of the semantic frames respectively.
We use a separate section of the N2 corpus, the
Inspire story texts, as the held-out validation set
used for parameter tuning, resulting in window

We compare our ILP inference (ILPI) to the
standard Berkeley coreference system (BER) with
both gold and predicted mentions. Table 1 shows
that our inference improves the MUC, BCUB and
CEAFE scores on both datasets, especially when
using gold mentions
10
. The average ILP running
times are 42.37s per UMIREC document and 22.7s
per N2 document on a Core I7 2.3 GHz quad-core
computer. Table 2 shows the effects of each con-
straint type when used alone. Surprisingly, the sim-
plest constraint type (definite & exact match con-
straints) gives us the best improvement especially
in terms of CEAFE score. This may be because
definite & exact match constraint links mentions
in the whole document, while the centering theory
and direct speech act constraints are more local.
And since short narrative stories often have a small
set of characters (usually represented by definite
noun phrases or proper nouns), when these charac-
ters are linked correctly, the coreference resolution
result is improved considerably.
8 Discussion
Our method provides a promising solution when
retraining a system is impossible or difficult. How-
ever, it may raise a question of the computing cost

Using gold mentions, our method also improves the score
on the CoNLL 2011 test set by +1.11% (AVG: 72.46).

for tuning penalty scores especially with the large
number of constraints. In such these cases, dividing
the constraints into different groups where all con-
straints in the same group have the same penalty
score may help to limit the number of scores that
need to be tuned. In our case study, the system
is not very sensitive to the values of the penalty
parameters. If we set all the penalty scores to 1,
the final AVG results on UMIREC and N2 corpus
are 66.05 and 66.68 respectively
11
. Those scores
are a bit less than the scores obtained after tuning
parameters but still higher than the results obtained
without ILP. Regardless, it’s true that the proposed
ILP approach is not necessarily less costly in some
settings, but it can be applied to any coreference
system that provides back pointers, not just the
Berkeley one.
Instead of adopting features of the target domain
as soft constraints as in our method, one may con-
sider to use them as linguistic features and retrain
the model. A simple domain adaptation approach
by augmenting the feature space (Daum´e et al.,
2010) based on a limited set of annotated data in
the target domain might be an alternative solution.
But note that our approach does not use any anno-
tated data of the target domain. Also, an unsuper-
vised system as (Lee et al., 2011) might encode the
target domain features (exact match noun phrases,
direct speech act) as sieves (hard), but with the
soft constraints, our system is more flexible when
making global decisions.
Our approach can be applied to another target do-
main, such as bio-medical domain where we have
entities and a list of acronyms in texts. Constrain-
ing the entities with their acronyms might help to
improve the coreference resolution for bio-medical
texts.
9 Conclusion
We have proposed a novel approach to adapt a su-
pervised coreference resolution system trained on
newswire domain to short narrative stories without
11
with gold mentions
retraining the system by modeling the inference
as an ILP problem with the features of narratives
adopted as soft constraints. Three phenomena that
are important for short narrative stories: local dis-
course coherence, speaker-listener relations, and
character-naming are modeled via centering theory,
direct speech act and definite noun phrase & ex-
act match constraints. We obtain promising results
when transferring the Berkeley coreference resolu-
tion trained on OntoNotes to UMIREC (Tales) and
N2 (Hadith). We find that the simplest constraints,
definite noun phrase & exact match constraints, are
the most effective in our case study assuming the
gold mentions. We also suggest an approach to
compute back pointers in coreference resolution
globally.
