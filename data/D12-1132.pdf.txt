Abstract
Most previous approaches to syntactic pars-
ing of Chinese rely on a preprocessing step
of word segmentation, thereby assuming there
was a clearly defined boundary between mor-
phology and syntax in Chinese. We show
how this assumption can fail badly, leading
to many out-of-vocabulary words and incom-
patible annotations. Hence in practice the
strict separation of morphology and syntax in
the Chinese language proves to be untenable.
We present a unified dependency parsing ap-
proach for Chinese which takes unsegmented
sentences as input and outputs both morpho-
logical and syntactic structures with a single
model and algorithm. By removing the inter-
mediate word segmentation, the unified parser
no longer needs separate notions for words
and phrases. Evaluation proves the effective-
ness of the unified model and algorithm in
parsing structures of words, phrases and sen-
tences simultaneously. 1
1 Introduction
The formulation of the concept of words has baf-
fled linguists from ancient to modern times (Hock-
ett, 1969). Things are even worse for Chinese, partly
due to the fact that its written form does not delimit
words explicitly. While we have no doubt that there
are linguistic units which are definitely words (or
phrases, for that matter), it’s a sad truth that in many
cases we cannot manage to draw such a clear bound-
ary between morphology and syntax, for which we
now give two arguments.
1Corresponding author is Guodong Zhou.
The first argument is that many sub-word linguis-
tic units (such as suffixes and prefixes) are so pro-
ductive that they can lead to a huge number of out-
of-vocabulary words for natural language process-
ing systems. This phenomenon brings us into an
awkward situation if we adhere to a rigid separa-
tion of morphology and syntax. Consider charac-
ter ? ‘someone’ as an example. On the one hand,
there is strong evidence that it’s not a word as it can
never be used alone. On the other hand, taking it as a
mere suffix leads to many out-of-vocabulary words
because of the productivity of such characters. For
instance, Penn Chinese Treebank (CTB6) contains
??? ‘one that fails’ as a word but not ???
‘one that succeeds’, even with the word ?? ‘suc-
ceed’ appearing 207 times. We call words like ?
?? ‘one that succeeds’ pseudo OOVs. By defini-
tion, pseudo OOVs are OOVs since they do not occur
in the training corpus, though their components are
frequently-seen words. Our estimation is that over
60% of OOVs in Chinese are of this kind (Section 2).
Of course, the way out of this dilemma is to parse
the internal structures of these words. That is to
say, we can still regard characters like ? as suf-
fixes, taking into account the fact that they cannot be
used alone. Meanwhile, pseudo OOVs can be largely
eliminated through analyzing their structures, thus
greatly facilitating syntactic and semantic analysis
of sentences. In fact, previous studies have revealed
other good reasons for parsing internal structures of
words (Zhao, 2009; Li, 2011).
The second argument is that in Chinese many lin-
guistic units can form both words and phrases with
exactly the same meaning and part-of-speech, which

causes lots of incompatible annotations in currently
available corpora. Take character? ‘law’ as an ex-
ample. It is head of both?? ‘criminal law’ and?
???? ‘environmental protection law’, but CTB
treat it as a suffix in the former (with the annotation
being ??_NN) and a word in the later (the anno-
tation is??_NN??_NN?_NN). These annota-
tions are incompatible since in both cases the char-
acter ? ‘law’ bears exactly the same meaning and
usage (e.g. part-of-speech). We examined several
widely used corpora and found that about 90% of
affixes were annotated incompatibly (Section 2). In-
compatibility can be avoided through parsing struc-
tures of both words and phrases. Figure 1 conveys
this idea. A further benefit of unified parsing is to
reduce data sparseness. As an example, in CTB6?
‘machine’ appears twice in phrases but 377 times in
words (e.g. ??? ‘accelerator’). Word structures
in Chinese can be excellent guide for parsing phrase
structures, and vice versa, due to their similarity.
The present paper makes two contributions in
light of these issues. Firstly, in order to get rid of
pseudo OOVs and incompatible annotations, we have
annotated structures of words in CTB6, after which
statistical models can learn structures of words as
well as phrases from the augmented treebank (Sec-
tion 4). Although previous authors have noticed
the importance of word-structure parsing (Li, 2011;
Zhao, 2009), no detailed description about annota-
tion of word structures has been provided in the liter-
ature. Secondly, we designed a unified dependency
parser whose input is unsegmented sentences and
its output incorporates both morphological and syn-
tactic structures with a single model and algorithm
(Section 5). By removing the intermediate step of
word segmentation, our unified parser no longer de-
pends on the unsound notion that there is a clear
boundary between words and phrases. Evaluation
(Section 6) shows that our unified parser achieves
satisfactory accuracies in parsing both morphologi-
cal and syntactic structures.

2 Pseudo OOVs and Incompatible
Annotations
In this section we show the surprisingly pervasive
nature of pseudo OOVs and incompatible annota-
tions through analysis of five segmented corpora,
which are CTB6 and corpus by MSR, PKU, AS
and CITYU provided in SIGHAN word segmentation
Bakeoffs 2.
First we use the standard split of training and test-
ing data and extract all OOVs for each corpus, then
count the number of pseudo OOVs. Table 1 gives the
result. It’s amazing that for every corpus, over 60%
of OOVs are pseudo, meaning they can be avoided if
their internal structures were parsed. Reduction of
OOVs at such a large scale can benefit greatly down-
stream natural language processing systems.
We then sample 200 word types containing a pro-
ductive affix from each corpus, and check whether
the affix also occurs somewhere else in a phrase,
i.e, the affix is annotated as a word in the phrase.
The results are in Table 2. It’s clear and somewhat
shocking that most affixes are annotated incompat-
ibly. We believe it is not the annotators to blame,
rather the root cause lies deeply in the unique char-
acteristics of the Chinese language. This becomes
obvious in comparison with English, where suffix
like ‘-ism’ in ‘capitalism’ cannot be used alone as a
word in phrases. 3 Incompatible annotations can
be removed only through unified parsing of word
and phrase structures, as mentioned earlier and il-
lustrated in Figure 1.

3Actually English allows examples like “pre- and post-war
imperialism” where a prefix like “pre” can appear on its own as
long as the hyphen is present and it is in a coordination struc-
ture. Note that such examples are much rarer than what we
discuss in this paper for Chinese. We thank the reviewer very
much for pointing this out and providing this example for us.

3 Unified Parsing Defined
Given an unsegmented sentence ???????
? ‘Gansu province attaches great importance to in-
surance industry’, the output of unified dependency
parser is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, this
output contains information about word (such as?
?_VV) as well as phrase structures (such as ?
?_VV ??_NN ?_NN), which is what we mean
by ‘unified’ parsing. Now, it’s no longer vital to dif-
ferentiate between morphology and syntax for Chi-
nese. People could regard??? ‘insurance indus-
try’ as a word or phrase, but either way, there will be
no disagreements about its internal structure. From
the perspective of the unified parser, linguistic units
are given the same labels as long as they function
similarly (e.g, they have the same parts-of-speech).
As a bonus, output of unified parsing incorpo-
rates Chinese word segmentation, part-of-speech
tagging and dependency parsing. To achieve these
goals, previous systems usually used a pipelined
approach by combining several statistical models,
which was further complicated by different decod-
ing algorithms for each of these models. The present
paper shows that a single model does all these jobs.
Besides being much simpler in engineering such a
parser, this approach is also a lot more plausible for
modeling human language understanding.
4 Annotation of Word Structures
Unified parsing requires a corpus annotated with
both morphological and syntactic structures. Such
a corpus can be built with the least effort if we be-
gin with an existing treebank such as CTB6 already
annotated with syntactic structures. It only remains
for us to annotate internal structures of words in this
treebank.
4.1 Scope of Annotation
In order to get rid of pseudo OOVs and incompati-
ble annotations, internal structures are annotated for
two kinds of words. The first kind contains words
with a productive component such as suffix or pre-
fix. One example is??? ‘speaker’ whose suffix
is the very productive? ‘person’ (e.g, in CTB6 there
are about 400 words having this suffix). The second
kind includes words with compositional semantics.
Examples are ??? ‘Monday’ and ??? ‘Sun-
day’. Though ?? ‘week’ is not very productive,
the meaning of words with this prefix is deducible
from semantics of their components.
Other compound words such as ?? ‘research’
have no productive components and are not a cause
of pseudo OOVs. They are universally consid-
ered as words instead of phrases due to their non-
compositional semantics. Hence their structures are
not annotated in the present research. Meanwhile,
for single-morpheme words with no structures what-
soever, like??? ‘Iraq’ and?? ‘bat’, annotation
of internal structures is of course unnecessary either.
Of all the 54, 214 word types in CTB6, 35% are
annotated, while the percentage is 24% for the 782,
901 word tokens. Around 80% of sentences contain
words whose structures need annotation. Our anno-
tations will be made publicly available for research
purposes.
4.2 From Part-of-speeches to Constituents
Of all 33 part-of-speech tags in CTB, annotation of
word structures is needed for nine tags: NN, VV, JJ,
CD, NT, NR, AD, VA and OD. Since part-of-speech
tags are preterminals and can only have one terminal
word as its child, POS tags of words become con-
stituent labels after annotation of word structures.
The mapping rules from POS tags to constituent la-
bels are listed in Table 3. Readers should note that

such mapping is not arbitrary. The constraint is that
in the treebank the POS tag must somewhere be the
unique child of the constituent label. Figure 3 de-
picts an example annotation, in which we also have
an example of NP having a tag NN as its only child.
4.3 Recursive Annotation
Some words in CTB have very complex structures.
Examples include ??????? ‘physicist ma-
joring in nuclear physics’, ????? ‘anti-trust
laws’ etc. Structures of these words are anno-
tated to their full possible depth. Existence of such
words are characteristic of the Chinese language,
since they are further demonstrations of the blurred
boundary between morphology and syntax. A full-
fledged parser is needed to analyze structures of
these words, which incidentally provides us with an-
other motivation for unified morphological and syn-
tactic parsing of Chinese.
5 Unified Dependency Parsing
All previous dependency parsers for Chinese take it
for granted that the input sentence is already seg-
mented into words (Li et al., 2011). Most systems
even require words to be tagged with their part-of-
speeches (Zhang and Nivre, 2011). Hence current
off-the-shelf algorithms are inadequate for parsing
unsegmented sentences. Instead, a new unified pars-
ing algorithm is given in this section.
5.1 Transitions
To map a raw sentence directly to output shown in
Figure 2, we define four transitions for the unified
dependency parser. They act on a stack containing
the incremental parsing results, and a queue holding
the incoming Chinese characters of the sentence:
SHIFT: the first character in the queue is shifted into
the stack as the start of a new word. The queue
should not be empty.
LEFT: the top two words of the stack are connected
with an arc, with the top one being the head. There
should be at least two elements on the stack.
RIGHT: the top two words of the stack are con-
nected, but with the top word being the child. The
precondition is the same as that of LEFT.
APPEND: the first character in the queue is appended
to the word at the top of the stack. There are two
preconditions. First, the queue should not be empty.
Second, the top of the stack must be a word with no
arcs connected to other words (i.e, up to now it has
got neither children nor parent).
We see that these transitions mimic the general arc-
standard dependency parsing models. The first three
of them were used, for example, by Yamada and
Matsumoto (2003) to parse English sentences. The
only novel addition is APPEND, which is necessary
because we are dealing with raw sentences. Its sole
purpose is to assemble characters into words with
no internal structures, such as ??? ‘Seattle’.
Thus this transition is the key for removing the need
of Chinese word segmentation and parsing unseg-
mented sentences directly.
To also output part-of-speech tags and depen-
dency labels, the transitions above can be aug-
mented accordingly. Hence we can change SHIFT to
SHIFT·X where X represents a certain POS tag. Also,
LEFT and RIGHT should be augmented with appro-
priate dependency relations, such as LEFT·SUBJ for
a dependency between verb and subject.
As a demonstration of the usage of these tran-
sitions, consider sentence ?????? “I love
Seattle”. Table 4 lists all steps of the parsing pro-
cess. Readers interested in implementing their own

unified dependency parsers are invited to study this
example carefully.
5.2 Model
Due to structural ambiguity, there might be quite a
lot of possibilities for parsing a given raw sentence.
Hence at each step in the parsing process, all four
transitions defined above may be applicable. To re-
solve ambiguities, each candidate parse is scored
with a global linear model defined as follows.
For an input sentence x, the parsing result F (x) is
the one with the highest score in all possible struc-
tures for this x:
F (x) = argmax
y?GEN(x)
Score(y) (1)
Here GEN(x) is a set of all possible parses for sen-
tence x, and Score(y) is a real-valued linear func-
tion:
Score(y) = ?(y) · ~w (2)
where ?(y) is a global feature vector extracted from
parsing result y, and ~w is a vector of weighting pa-
rameters. Because of its linearity, Score(y) can be
computed incrementally, following the transition of
each parsing step. Parameter vector ~w is trained
with the generalized perceptron algorithm of Collins
(2002). The early-update strategy of Collins and
Roark (2004) is used so as to improve accuracy and
speed up the training.
5.3 Feature Templates
For a particular parse y, we now describe the way
of computing its feature vector ?(y) in the linear

ing the partial results, and Q the queue storing the
incoming Chinese characters of a raw sentence, then
transition-based parsing features are extracted from

Although we employ transition-based parsing,
nothing prevents us from using graph-based fea-

dency parsers using both transition-based and graph-
based features tend to achieve higher accuracy than
parsers which only make use of one kind of features.
Table 6 gives the graph-based feature templates used
in our parser. All such templates are instantiated at
the earliest possible time, in order to reduce as much
as possible situations where correct parses fall out of
the beam during decoding.
5.4 Decoding Algorithm
We use beam-search to find the best parse for a given
raw sentence (Algorithm 1). This algorithm uses
double beams. The first beam contains unfinished
parsing results, while the second holds completed
parses. Double beams are necessary because the
number of transitions might well be different for dif-
ferent parses, and those parses that finished earlier
are not necessarily better parses. During the search-
ing process, correct parse could fall off the beams,
resulting in a search error. However, in practice
beam search decoding algorithm works quite well.
In addition, it’s not feasible to use dynamic program-
ming because of the complicated features used in the
model.
The B in Algorithm 1 is the width of the two
beams. In our experiments we set B to 64. This
value of B was determined empirically by using the
standard development set of the data, with the goal
of achieving the highest possible accuracy within
reasonable time. Note that in line 20 of the algo-
rithm, the beam for completed parsers are pruned at
each iteration of the parsing process. The purpose
of this action is to keep this beam from growing too
big, resulting in a waste of memory space.

6 Experiments and Evaluation
We describe the experiments carried out and our
method of evaluation of the unified dependency
parser. We used Penn2Malt 4 to convert constituent
trees of CTB to dependency relations. The head rules
for this conversion was given by Zhang and Clark
(2008). In all experiments, we followed the stan-

dard split of the data into training, testing and devel-
opment data (Zhang and Clark, 2011). Though we
annotated structures of words in CTB6, most previ-
ously results were on CTB5, a subset of the former
treebank. Hence we report our results of evaluation
on CTB5 for better comparability.
6.1 Dependency Parsing of Morphological and
Syntactic Structures
If we look back at the Figure 2, it’s clear that a
dependency relation is correctly parsed if and only
if three conditions are met: Firstly, words at both
ends of the dependency are correctly segmented.
Secondly, part-of-speech tags are correct for both
words. Thirdly, the direction of the dependency re-
lation are correct. Of course, if labeled precision and
recall is to be measured, the label of the dependency
relation should also be correctly recovered. Let nc
be the number of dependencies correctly parsed with
respect to these criterion, no be the total number of
dependencies in the output, and nr the number of
dependencies in the reference. Then precision is de-
fined to be p = nc/no and recall is defined to be
r = nc/nr.
6.1.1 Results on the Original CTB5
We first train our unified dependency parser with
the original treebank CTB5. In this case, all words
are considered to be flat, with no internal structures.
The result are shown in Table 7. Note that on ex-
actly the same testing data, i.e, the original CTB5,
unified parser performs much better than the result
of a pipelined approach reported by Zhang and Clark
(2011). There are about 30% of relative error reduc-
tion for the unlabeled dependency parsing results.
This is yet another evidence of the advantage of joint
modeling in natural language processing, details of
which will be discussed in Section 7.

6.1.2 Results on CTB with Structures of Words
Annotated
Then we train the parser with CTB5 augmented
with our annotations of internal structures of words.
For purpose of better comparability, we report re-
sults on both the original dependencies of CTB5 and
on the dependencies of CTB5 plus those of the in-
ternal structures of words. The results are shown
in Table 8. First, note that compared to another re-
sult by Zhang and Nivre (2011), whose input were
sentences with gold standard word segmentation and
POS tags, our F-score is only slightly lower even
with input of unsegmented sentences. This is un-
derstandable since gold-standard segmentation and
POS tags greatly reduced the uncertainty of parsing
results.
For the unified parser, the improvement of F-score
from 79.72% to 83.29% is attributed to the fact that
with internal structures of words annotated, parsing
of syntactic structures is also improved due to the
similarity of word and phrase structures mentioned
in Section 1, and also due to the fact that many
phrase level dependencies are now facing a much
less severe problem of data sparsity. The improve-
ment of F-score from 83.29% to 86.44% is attributed
to the annotation of word structures. Internal struc-
tures of words are be mostly local in comparison
with phrase and sentence structures. Therefore, with
the addition of word structures, the overall depen-
dency parsing accuracy naturally can be improved.
6.2 Chinese Word Segmentation
From the example in Figure 2, it is clear that output
of unified parser contains Chinese word segmenta-
tion information. Therefore, we can get results of
word segmentation for each sentence in the test sets,

and evaluate their accuracies. For maximal compa-
rability, we train the unified parser on the original
CTB5 data used by previous studies. The result is
in Table 9. Despite the fact that the performance
of our unified parser does not exceed the best re-
ported result so far, which probably might be caused
by some minute implementation specific details, it’s
fair to say that our parser performs at the level of
state-of-the-art in Chinese word segmentation.
6.3 Joint Word Segmentation and POS Tagging
From Figure 2 we see that besides word segmenta-
tion, output of the unified parser also includes part-
of-speech tags. Therefore, it’s natural that we evalu-
ate the accuracy of joint Chinese word segmentation
and part of speech tagging, as reported in previous
literature (Kruengkrai et al., 2009). The results are
in Table 10, in which for ease of comparison, again
we train the unified parser with the vanilla version
of CTB5. We can see that unified parser performs at
virtually the same level of accuracy compared with
previous best systems.
7 Related Work
Researchers have noticed the necessity of parsing
the internal structures of words in Chinese. Li
(2011) gave an method that could take raw sentences
as input and output phrase structures and internal
structures of words. This paper assumes that the in-
put are unsegmented, too, and our output also in-
cludes both word and phrase structures. There are

two key differences, though. The first is we output
dependency relations instead of constituent struc-
tures. Although dependencies can be extracted from
the constituent trees of Li (2011), the time complex-
ity of their algorithm is O(n5) while our parser runs
in linear time. Secondly, we specify the details of
annotating structures of words, with the annotations
being made publicly available.
Zhao (2009) presented a dependency parser which
regards each Chinese character as a word and then
analyzes the dependency relations between charac-
ters, using ordinary dependency parsing algorithms.
Our parser is different in two important ways. The
first is we output both part-of-speech tags and la-
beled dependency relations, both of which were ab-
sent in Zhao’s parser. More importantly, the AP-
PEND transition for handling flat words were unseen
in previous studies as far as we know. The difference
can best be described with an example: For the sen-
tence in Section 3, Zhao’s parser output the result in
Figure 4 while in contrast our output is Figure 2.
In recent years, considerable efforts have been
made in joint modeling and learning in natural lan-
guage processing (Lee et al., 2011; Sun, 2011; Li et
al., 2011; Finkel and Manning, 2009; Kruengkrai et
al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2008; Goldberg and Tsarfaty,
2008). Joint modeling can improve the performance
of NLP systems due to the obvious reason of being
able to make use of various levels of information si-
multaneously. However, the thesis of this paper, i.e,
unified parsing of Chinese word and phrase struc-
tures, bears a deeper meaning. As demonstrated in
Section 1 and by Li (2011), structures of words and
phrases usually have significant similarity, and the
distinction between them is very difficult to define,
even for expert linguists. But for real world applica-
tions, such subtle matters can safely be ignored if we
could analyzed morphological and syntactic struc-
tures in a unified framework. What applications re-
ally cares is structures instead of whether a linguistic
unit is a word or phrase.

Another notable line of research closely related
to the present work is to annotate and parse the flat
structures of noun phrases (NP) (Vadas and Curran,
2007; Vadas and Curran, 2011). This paper dif-
fers from those previous work on parsing NPs in at
least two significant ways. First, we aim to parse
all kinds of words (e.g, nouns, verbs, adverbs, ad-
jectives etc) whose structures are not annotated by
CTB, and whose presence could cause lots of pseudo
OOVs and incompatible annotations. Second, the
problem we are trying to solve is a crucial obser-
vation specific to Chinese language, that is, in lots
of cases forcing a separation of words and phrases
leads to awkward situations for NLP systems. Re-
member that in Section 2 we demonstrated that all
corpora we examined had the problem of pseudo
OOVs and incompatible annotations. In comparison,
the problem Vadas and Curran (2007) tried to solve
is a lack of annotation for structures of NPs in cur-
rently available treebanks, or to put it in another way,
a problem more closely related to treebanks rather
than certain languages.
8 Discussion and Conclusion
Chinese word segmentation is an indispensable step
for traditional approaches to syntactic parsing of
Chinese. The purpose of word segmentation is to
decide what goes to words, with the remaining pro-
cessing (e.g, parsing) left to higher level structures
of phrases and sentences. This paper shows that it
could be very difficult to make such a distinction
between words and phrases. This difficulty cannot
be left unheeded, as we have shown quantitatively
that in practice it causes lots of real troubles such as
too many OOVs and incompatible annotations. We
showed how these undesirable consequences can be
resolved by annotation of the internal structures of
words, and by unified parsing of morphological and
syntactic structures in Chinese.
Unified parsing of morphological and syntactic
structures of Chinese can also be implemented with
a pipelined approach, in which we first segment in-
put sentences into words or affixes (i.e, with the
finest possible granularity), and then we do part-
of-speech tagging followed by dependency (or con-
stituent) parsing. However, a unified parsing ap-
proach using a single model as presented in this
paper offers several advantages over pipelined ap-
proaches. The first one is that joint modeling tends
to result in higher accuracy and suffer less from er-
ror propagation than do pipelined methods. Sec-
ondly, both the unified model and the algorithm
are conceptually much more simpler than pipelined
approaches. We only need one implementation of
the model and algorithm, instead of several ones in
pipelined approaches. Thirdly, our model and al-
gorithm might comes closer to modeling the pro-
cess of human language understanding, because hu-
man brain is more likely a parallel machine in un-
derstanding languages than an alternative pipelined
processor. Hence this work, together with previ-
ous studies by other authors like Li (2011) and Zhao
(2009), open up a possibly new direction for future
research efforts in parsing the Chinese language.
