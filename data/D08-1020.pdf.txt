Abstract
We combine lexical, syntactic, and discourse
features to produce a highly predictive model
of human readers’ judgments of text readabil-
ity. This is the first study to take into ac-
count such a variety of linguistic factors and
the first to empirically demonstrate that dis-
course relations are strongly associated with
the perceived quality of text. We show that
various surface metrics generally expected to
be related to readability are not very good pre-
dictors of readability judgments in our Wall
Street Journal corpus. We also establish that
readability predictors behave differently de-
pending on the task: predicting text readabil-
ity or ranking the readability. Our experi-
ments indicate that discourse relations are the
one class of features that exhibits robustness
across these two tasks.
1 Introduction
The quest for a precise definition of text quality—
pinpointing the factors that make text flow and easy
to read—has a long history and tradition. Way back
in 1944 Robert Gunning Associates was set up, of-
fering newspapers, magazines and business firms
consultations on clear writing (Gunning, 1952).
In education, teaching good writing technique and
grading student writing has always been of key
importance (Spandel, 2004; Attali and Burstein,
2006). Linguists have also studied various aspects of
text flow, with cohesion-building devices in English
(Halliday and Hasan, 1976), rhetorical structure the-
ory (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and centering the-
ory (Grosz et al., 1995) among the most influential
contributions.
Still, we do not have unified computational mod-
els that capture the interplay between various as-
pects of readability. Most studies focus on a sin-
gle factor contributing to readability for a given in-
tended audience. The use of rare words or technical
terminology for example can make text difficult to
read for certain audience types (Collins-Thompson
and Callan, 2004; Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005;
Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007). Syntactic complexity
is associated with delayed processing time in un-
derstanding (Gibson, 1998) and is another factor
that can decrease readability. Text organization (dis-
course structure), topic development (entity coher-
ence) and the form of referring expressions also de-
termine readability. But we know little about the rel-
ative importance of each factor and how they com-
bine in determining perceived text quality.
In our work we use texts from the Wall Street
Journal intended for an educated adult audience
to analyze readability factors including vocabulary,
syntax, cohesion, entity coherence and discourse.
We study the association between these features and
reader assigned readability ratings, showing that dis-
course and vocabulary are the factors most strongly
linked to text quality. In the easier task of text qual-
ity ranking, entity coherence and syntax features
also become significant and the combination of fea-
tures allows for ranking prediction accuracy of 88%.
Our study is novel in the use of gold-standard dis-
course features for predicting readability and the si-
multaneous analysis of various readability factors.

2.1 Readability with respect to intended
readers
The definition of what one might consider to be
a well-written and readable text heavily depends
on the intended audience (Schriver, 1989). Obvi-
ously, even a superbly written scientific paper will
not be perceived as very readable by a lay person
and a great novel might not be appreciated by a
third grader. As a result, the vast majority of prior
work on readability deals with labeling texts with
the appropriate school grade level. A key observa-
tion in even the oldest work in this area is that the
vocabulary used in a text largely determines its read-
ability. More common words are easier, so some
metrics measured text readability by the percent-
age of words that were not among the N most fre-
quent in the language. It was also observed that fre-
quently occurring words are often short, so word
length was used to approximate readability more
robustly than using a predefined word frequency
list. Standard indices were developed based on the
link between word frequency/length and readabil-
ity, such as Flesch-Kincaid (Kincaid, 1975), Auto-
mated Readability Index (Kincaid, 1975), Gunning
Fog (Gunning, 1952), SMOG (McLaughlin, 1969),
and Coleman-Liau (Coleman and Liau, 1975). They
use only a few simple factors that are designed to
be easy to calculate and are rough approximations
to the linguistic factors that determine readability.
For example, Flesch-Kincaid uses the average num-
ber of syllables per word to approximate vocabulary
difficulty and the average number of words per sen-
tence to approximate syntactic difficulty.
In recent work, the idea of linking word frequency
and text readability has been explored for making
medical information more accessible to the general
public. (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007) classified words
in medical texts as familiar or unfamiliar to a gen-
eral audience based on their frequencies in corpora.
When a description of the unfamiliar terms was pro-
vided, the perceived readability of the texts almost
doubled.
A more general and principled approach to using
vocabulary information for readability decisions has
been the use of language models. For any given text,
it is easy to compute its likelihood under a given lan-
guage model, i.e. one for text meant for children,
or for text meant for adults, or for a given grade
level. (Si and Callan, 2001), (Collins-Thompson and
Callan, 2004), (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005), and
(Heilman et al., 2007) used language models to pre-
dict the suitability of texts for a given school grade
level. But even for this type of task other factors
besides vocabulary use are at play in determining
readability. Syntactic complexity is an obvious fac-
tor: indeed (Heilman et al., 2007) and (Schwarm and
Ostendorf, 2005) also used syntactic features, such
as parse tree height or the number of passive sen-
tences, to predict reading grade levels. For the task
of deciding whether a text is written for an adult or
child reader, (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) found that
adding entity coherence to (Schwarm and Ostendorf,
2005)’s list of features improves classification accu-
racy by 10%.
2.2 Readability as coherence for competent
language users
In linguistics and natural language processing, the
text properties rather than those of the reader are em-
phasized. Text coherence is defined as the ease with
which a person (tacitly assumed to be a competent
language user) understands a text. Coherent text is
characterized by various types of cohesive links that
facilitate text comprehension (Halliday and Hasan,
1976).
In recent work, considerable attention has been
devoted to entity coherence in text quality, espe-
cially in relation to information ordering. In many
applications such as text generation and summariza-
tion, systems need to decide the order in which se-
lected sentences or generated clauses should be pre-
sented to the user. Most models attempting to cap-
ture local coherence between sentences were based
on or inspired by centering theory (Grosz et al.,
1995), which postulated strong links between the
center of attention in comprehension of adjacent
sentences and syntactic position and form of refer-
ence. In a detailed study of information ordering
in three very different corpora, (Karamanis et al., to
appear) assessed the performance of various formu-
lations of centering. Their results were somewhat
unexpected, showing that while centering transition
preferences were useful, the most successful strat-
egy for information ordering was based on avoid-
187
ing rough shifts, that is, sequences of sentences that
share no entities in common. This supports previous
findings that such types of transitions are associated
with poorly written text and can be used to improve
the accuracy of automatic grading of essays based
on various non-discourse features (Miltsakaki and
Kukich, 2000). In a more powerful generalization
of centering, Barzilay and Lapata (2008) developed
a novel approach which doesn’t postulate a prefer-
ence for any type of transition but rather computes
a set of features that capture transitions of all kinds
in the text and their relative proportion. Their en-
tity coherence features prove to be very suitable for
various tasks, notably for information ordering and
reading difficulty level.
Form of reference is also important in well-
written text and appropriate choices lead to im-
proved readability. Use of pronouns for reference
to highly salient entities is perceived as more de-
sirable than the use of definite noun phrases (Gor-
don et al., 1993; Krahmer and Theune, 2002). The
syntactic forms of first mention—when an entity is
first introduced in a text—differ from those of subse-
quent mentions (Poesio and Vieira, 1998; Nenkova
and McKeown, 2003) and can be exploited for im-
proving and predicting text coherence (Siddharthan,
2003; Nenkova and McKeown, 2003; Elsner and
Charniak, 2008).
3 Data
The objective of our study is to analyze various
readability factors, including discourse relations, be-
cause few empirical studies exist that directly link
discourse structure with text quality. In the past,
subsections of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,
1994) have been annotated for discourse relations
(Carlson et al., 2001; Wolf and Gibson, 2005). For
our study we chose to work with the newly released
Penn Discourse Treebank which is the largest anno-
tated resource which focuses exclusively on implicit
local relations between adjacent sentences and ex-
plicit discourse connectives.
3.1 Discourse annotation
The Penn Discourse Treebank (Prasad et al., 2008)
is a new resource with annotations of discourse con-
nectives and their senses in the Wall Street Journal
portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994).
All explicit relations (those marked with a discourse
connective) are annotated. In addition, each adjacent
pair of sentences within a paragraph is annotated. If
there is a discourse relation, then it is marked im-
plicit and annotated with one or more connectives. If
there is a relation between the sentences but adding a
connective would be inappropriate, it is marked Al-
tLex. If the consecutive sentences are only related
by entity-based coherence (Knott et al., 2001) they
are annotated with EntRel. Otherwise, they are an-
notated with NoRel.
Besides labeling the connective, the PDTB also
annotates the sense of each relation. The relations
are organized into a hierarchy. The top level rela-
tions are Expansion, Comparison, Contingency, and
Temporal. Briefly, an expansion relation means that
the second clause continues the theme of the first
clause, a comparison relation indicates that some-
thing in the two clauses is being compared, contin-
gency means that there is a causal relation between
the clauses, and temporal means they occur either at
the same time or sequentially.
3.2 Readability ratings
We randomly selected thirty articles from the Wall
Street Journal corpus that was used in both the Penn
Treebank and the Penn Discourse Treebank.1 Each
article was read by at least three college students,
each of whom was given unlimited time to read the
texts and perform the ratings.2 Subjects were asked
the following questions:
• How well-written is this article?
• How well does the text fit together?
• How easy was it to understand?
• How interesting is this article?
For each question, they provided a rating between 1
and 5, with 5 being the best and 1 being the worst.
1One of the selected articles was missing from the Penn
Treebank. Thus, results that do not require syntactic informa-
tion (Tables 1, 2, 4, and 6) are over all thirty articles, while
Tables 3, 5, and 7 report results for the twenty-nine articles with
Treebank parse trees.
2(Lapata, 2006) found that human ratings are significantly
correlated with self-paced reading times, a more direct measure
of processing effort which we plan to explore in future work.
188
After collecting the data, it turned out that most of
the time subjects gave the same rating to all ques-
tions. For competent language users, we view text
readability and text coherence as equivalent prop-
erties, measuring the extent to which a text is well
written. Thus for all subsequent analysis, we will
use only the first question (“On a scale of 1 to 5,
how well written is this text?”). The score of an arti-
cle was then the average of all the ratings it received.
The article scores ranged from 1.5 to 4.33, with a
mean of 3.2008 and a standard deviation of .7242.
The median score was 3.286.
We define our task as predicting this average rat-
ing for each article. Note that this task may be
more difficult than predicting reading level, as each
of these articles appeared in the Wall Street Journal
and thus is aimed at the same target audience. We
suspected that in classifying adult text, more subtle
features might be necessary.
4 Identifying correlates of text quality
4.1 Baseline measures
We first computed the Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients between the simple metrics that most tradi-
tional readability formulas use and the average hu-
man ratings. These results are shown in Table 1. We
tested the average number of characters per word,
average number of words per sentence, maximum
number of words per sentence, and article length
(F7).3 Article length (F7) was the only significant
baseline factor, with correlation of -0.37. Longer ar-
ticles are perceived as less well-written and harder
to read than shorter ones. None of the other baseline
metrics were close to being significant predictors of
readability.
Average Characters/Word r = -.0859, p = .6519
Average Words/Sentence r = .1637, p = .3874
Max Words/Sentence r = .0866, p = .6489
F7 text length r = -.3713, p = .0434
Table 1: Baseline readability features
3For ease of reference, we number each non-baseline feature
in the text and tables.
4.2 Vocabulary
We use a unigram language model, where the prob-
ability of an article is:
?
w
P (w|M)C(w) (1)
P (w|M) is the probability of word-type w accord-
ing to a background corpus M , and C(w) is the
number of times w appears in the article.
The log likelihood of an article is then:
?
w
C(w) log(P (w|M)) (2)
Note that this model will be biased in favor of
shorter articles. Since each word has probability less
than 1, the log probability of each word is less than
0, and hence including additional words decreases
the log likelihood. We compensate for this by per-
forming linear regressions with the unigram log like-
lihood and with the number of words in the article as
an additional variable.
The question then arises as to what to use as a
background corpus. We chose to experiment with
two corpora: the entire Wall Street Journal corpus
and a collection of general AP news, which is gen-
erally more diverse than the financial news found in
the WSJ. We predicted that the NEWS vocabulary
would be more representative of the types of words
our readers would be familiar with. In both cases we
used Laplace smoothing over the word frequencies
and a stoplist.
The vocabulary features we used are article like-
lihood estimated from a language model from WSJ
(F5), and article likelihood according to a unigram
language model from NEWS (F6). We also combine
the two likelihood features with article length, in or-
der to get a better estimate of the language model’s
influence on readability independent of the length of
the article.
F5 Log likelihood, WSJ r = .3723, p = .0428
F6 Log likelihood, NEWS r= .4497, p = .0127
LL with length, WSJ r = .3732, p = .0422
LL with length, NEWS r = .6359, p = .0002
Table 2: Vocabulary features
Both vocabulary-based features (F5 and F6) are
significantly correlated with the readability judg-
ments, with p-values smaller than 0.05 (see Table 2).
189
The correlations are positive: the more probable an
article was based on its vocabulary, the higher it was
generally rated. As expected, the NEWS model that
included more general news stories had a higher cor-
relation with people’s judgments. When combined
with the length of the article, the unigram language
model from the NEWS corpus becomes very predic-
tive of readability, with the correlation between the
two as high as 0.63.
4.3 Syntactic features
Syntactic constructions affect processing difficulty
and so might also affect readability judgments.
We examined the four syntactic features used in
(Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005): average parse tree
height (F1), average number of noun phrases per
sentence (F2), average number of verb phrases per
sentence (F3), and average number of subordinate
clauses per sentence(SBARs in the Penn Treebank
tagset) (F4). The sentence “We’re talking about
years ago [SBAR before anyone heard of asbestos
having any questionable properties].” contains an
example of an SBAR clause.
Having multiple noun phrases (entities) in each
sentence requires the reader to remember more
items, but may make the article more interesting.
(Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) found that articles writ-
ten for adults tended to contain many more entities
than articles written for children. While including
more verb phrases in each sentence increases the
sentence complexity, adults might prefer to have re-
lated clauses explicitly grouped together.
F1 Average Parse Tree Height r = -.0634, p = .7439
F2 Average Noun Phrases r = .2189, p = .2539
F3 Average Verb Phrases r = .4213, p = .0228
F4 Average SBARs r = .3405, p = .0707
Table 3: Syntax-related features
The correlations between readability and syntac-
tic features is shown in Table 3. The strongest corre-
lation is that between readability and number of verb
phrases (0.42). This finding is in line with prescrip-
tive clear writing advice (Gunning, 1952; Spandel,
2004), but is to our knowledge novel in the compu-
tational linguistics literature. As (Bailin and Graf-
stein, 2001) point out, the sentences in (1) are eas-
ier to comprehend than the sentences in (2), even
though they are longer.
(1) It was late at night, but it was clear. The stars
were out and the moon was bright.
(2) It was late at night. It was clear. The stars were
out. The moon was bright.
Multiple verb phrases in one sentence may be in-
dicative of explicit discourse relations, which we
will discuss further in section 4.6.
Surprisingly, the use of clauses introduced
by a (possibly empty) subordinating conjunction
(SBAR), are actually positively correlated (and al-
most approaching significance) with readability. So
while for children or less educated adults these con-
structions might pose difficulties, they were favored
by our assessors. On the other hand, the average
parse tree height negatively correlated with readabil-
ity as expected, but surprisingly the correlation is
very weak (-0.06).
4.4 Elements of lexical cohesion
In their classic study of cohesion in English, (Hal-
liday and Hasan, 1976) discuss the various aspects
of well written discourse, including the use of cohe-
sive devices such as pronouns, definite descriptions
and topic continuity from sentence to sentence.4 To
measure the association between these features and
readability rankings, we compute the number of pro-
nouns per sentence (F11) and the number of defi-
nite articles per sentence (F12). In order to qual-
ify topic continuity from sentence to sentence in
the articles, we compute average cosine similarity
(F8), word overlap (F9) and word overlap over just
nouns and pronouns (F10) between pairs of adjacent
sentences5. Each sentence is turned into a vector
of word-types, where each type’s value is its tf-idf
(where document frequency is computed over all the
articles in the WSJ corpus). The cosine similarity
metric is then:
cos (s, t) =
s · t
|s| |t|
(3)
4Other cohesion building devises discussed by Halliday
and Hansan include lexical reiteration and discourse relations,
which we address next.
5Similar features have been used for automatic essay grad-
ing as well (Higgins et al., 2004).
190
F8 Avr. Cosine Overlap r = -.1012, p = .5947
F9 Avr. Word Overlap r = -.0531, p = .7806
F10 Avr. Noun+Pronoun Overlap r = .0905, p = .6345
F11 Avr. # Pronouns/Sent r = .2381, p = .2051
F12 Avr # Definite Articles r = .2309, p = .2196
Table 4: Superficial measures of topic continuity and pro-
noun and definite description use
None of these features correlate significantly with
readability as can be seen from the results in Ta-
ble 4. The overlap features are particularly bad
predictors of readability, with average word/cosine
overlap in fact being negatively correlated with read-
ability. The form of reference—use of pronouns
and definite descriptions—exhibit a higher correla-
tion with readability (0.23), but these values are not
significant for the size of our corpus.
4.5 Entity coherence
We use the Brown Coherence Toolkit6 to compute
entity grids (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008) for each ar-
ticle. In each sentence, an entity is identified as the
subject (S), object (O), other (X) (for example, part
of a prepositional phrase), or not present (N). The
probability of each transition type is computed. For
example, an S-O transition occurs when an entity
is the subject in one sentence then an object in the
next; X-N transition occurs when an entity appears
in non-subject or object position in one sentence and
not present in the next, etc.7 The entity coherence
features are the probability of each of these pairs of
transitions, for a total of 16 features (F17?32; see
complete results in Table 5).
None of the entity grid features are significantly
correlated with the readability ratings. One very in-
teresting result is that the proportion of S-S transi-
tions in which the same entity was mentioned in sub-
ject position in two adjacent sentences, is negatively
correlated with readability. In centering theory, this
is considered the most coherent type of transition,
keeping the same center of attention. Moreover, the
feature most strongly correlated with readability is
the S-N transition (0.31) in which the subject of one
sentence does not appear at all in the following sen-

7The Brown Coherence Toolkit identifies NPs as the same
entity if they have identical head nouns.
F17 Prob. of S-S transition r = -.1287, p = .5059
F18 Prob. of S-O transition r = -.0427, p = .8261
F19 Prob. of S-X transition r = -.1450, p = .4529
F20 Prob. of S-N transition r = .3116, p = .0999
F21 Prob. of O-S transition r = .1131, p = .5591
F22 Prob. of O-O transition r = .0825, p = .6706
F23 Prob. of O-X transition r = .0744, p = .7014
F24 Prob. of O-N transition r = .2590, p = .1749
F25 Prob. of X-S transition r = .1732, p = .3688
F26 Prob. of X-O transition r = .0098, p = .9598
F27 Prob. of X-X transition r = -.0655, p = .7357
F28 Prob. of X-N transition r = .1319, p = .4953
F29 Prob. of N-S transition r = .1898, p = .3242
F30 Prob. of N-O transition r = .2577, p = .1772
F31 Prob. of N-X transition r = .1854, p = .3355
F32 Prob. of N-N transition r = -.2349, p = .2200

ratings and entity coherence.
tence. Of course, it is difficult to interpret the en-
tity grid features one by one, since they are inter-
dependent and probably it is the interaction of fea-
tures (relative proportions of transitions) that capture
overall readability patterns.
4.6 Discourse relations
Discourse relations are believed to be a major factor
in text coherence. We computed another language
model which is over discourse relations instead of
words. We treat each text as a bag of relations rather
than a bag of words. Each relation is annotated
for both its sense and how it is realized (implicit
or explicit). For example, one text might contain
{Implicit Comparison, Explicit Temporal, NoRel}.
We computed the probability of each of our articles
according to a multinomial model, where the proba-
bility of a text with n relation tokens and k relation
types is:
P (n)
n!
x1!...xk!
px11 ...p
xk
k (4)
P (n) is the probability of an article having length
n, xi is the number of times relation i appeared, and
pi is the probability of relation i based on the Penn
Discourse Treebank. P (n) is the maximum likeli-
hood estimation of an article having n discourse re-
lations based on the entire Penn Discourse Treebank
(the number of articles with exactly n discourse re-
lations, divided by the total number of articles).
191
The log likelihood of an article based on its dis-
course relations (F13) feature is defined as:
log(P (n)) + log(n!) +
k?
i=1
(xi log(pi)? log(xi!))
(5)
The multinomial distribution is particularly suit-
able, because it directly incorporates length, which
significantly affects readability as we discussed ear-
lier. It also captures patterns of relative frequency of
relations, unlike the simpler unigram model. Note
also that this equation has an advantage over the un-
igram model that was not present for vocabulary.
While every article contains at least one word, some
articles do not contain any discourse relations. Since
the PDTB annotated all explicit relations and re-
lations between adjacent sentences in a paragraph,
an article with no discourse connectives and only
single sentence paragraphs would not contain any
annotated discourse relations. Under the unigram
model, these articles’ probabilities cannot be com-
puted. Under the multinomial model, the probabil-
ity of an article with zero relations is estimated as
Pr(N = 0), which can be calculated from the cor-
pus.
As in the case of vocabulary features, the presence
of more relations will lead to overall lower probabil-
ities so we also consider the number of discourse
relations (F14) and the log likelihood combined with
the number of relations as features. In order to iso-
late the effect of the type of discourse relation (ex-
plicitly expressed by a discourse connective such as
“because” or “however” versus implicitly expressed
by adjacency), we also compute multinomial model
features for the explicit discourse relations (F15) and
over just the implicit discourse relations (F16).
F13 LogL of discourse rels r = .4835, p = .0068
F14 # of discourse relations r = -.2729, p = .1445
LogL of rels with # of rels r = .5409, p = .0020
# of relations with # of words r = .3819, p = .0373
F15 Explicit relations only r = .1528, p = .4203
F16 Implicit relations only r = .2403, p = .2009
Table 6: Discourse features
The likelihood of discourse relations in the text
under a multinomial model is very highly and sig-
nificantly correlated with readability ratings, espe-
cially after text length is taken into account. Cor-
relations are 0.48 and 0.54 respectively. The prob-
ability of the explicit relations alone is not a suffi-
ciently strong indicator of readability. This fact is
disappointing as the explicit relations can be iden-
tified much more easily in unannotated text (Pitler
et al., 2008). Note that the sequence of just the im-
plicit relations is also not sufficient. This observa-
tion implies that the proportion of explicit and im-
plicit relations may be meaningful but we leave the
exploration of this issue for later work.
4.7 Summary of findings
So far, we introduced six classes of factors that have
been discussed in the literature as readability cor-
relates. Through statistical tests of associations we
identified the individual factors significantly corre-
lated with readability ratings. These are, in decreas-
ing order of association strength:
LogL of Discourse Relations (r = .4835)
LogL, NEWS (r= .4497)
Average Verb Phrases (.4213)
LogL, WSJ (r = .3723)
Number of words (r = -.3713)
Vocabulary and discourse relations are the
strongest predictors of readability, followed by aver-
age number of verb phrases and length of the text.
This empirical confirmation of the significance of
discourse relations as a readability factor is novel for
the computational linguistics literature. Note though
that for our work we use oracle discourse annota-
tions directly from the PDTB and no robust systems
for automatic discourse annotation exist today.
The significance of the average number of verb
phrases as a readability predictor is somewhat sur-
prising but intriguing. It would lead to reexamina-
tion of the role of verbs/predicates in written text,
which we also plan to address in future work. None
of the other factors showed significant association
with readability ratings, even though some correla-
tions had relatively large positive values.
5 Combining readability factors
In this section, we turn to the question of how the
combination of various factors improves the predic-
tion of readability. We use the leaps package in R
to find the best subset of features for linear regres-
sion, for subsets of size one to eight. We use the
192
squared multiple correlation coefficient (R2) to as-
sess the effectiveness of predictions. R2 is the pro-
portion of variance in readability ratings explained
by the model. If the model predicts readability per-
fectly, R2 = 1, and if the model has no predictive
capability, R2 = 0.
F13, R2 = 0.2662
F6 + F7, R2 = 0.4351
F6 + F7 + F13, R2 = 0.5029
F6 + F7 + F13 + F14, R2 = 0.6308
F1 + F6 + F7 + F10 + F13, R2 = 0.6939
F1 + F6 + F7 + F10 + F13 + F23, R2 = 0.7316
F1 + F6 + F7 + F10 + F13 + F22 + F23, R2 = 0.7557
F1+F6+F7+F10+F11+F13+F19+F30, R2 = 0.776.
The linear regression results confirm the expec-
tation that the combination of different factors is a
rather complex issue. As expected, discourse, vo-
cabulary and length which were the significant in-
dividual factors appear in the best model for each
feature set size. Their combination gives the best
result for regression with three predictors, and they
explain half of the variance in readability ratings,
R2 = 0.5029.
But the other individually significant feature, av-
erage number of verb phrases per sentence (F3)
never appears in the best models. Instead, F1—the
depth of the parse tree—appears in the best model
with more than four features.
Also unexpectedly, two of the superficial cohe-
sion features appear in the larger models: F10 is
the average word overlap over nouns and pronouns
and F11 is the average number of pronouns per sen-
tence. Entity grid features also make their way into
the best models when more features are used for pre-
diction: S-X, O-O, O-X, N-O transitions (F19, F22,
F23, F30).
6 Readability as ranking
In this section we consider the problem of pairwise
ranking of text readability. That is, rather than try-
ing to predict the readability of a single document,
we consider pairs of documents and predict which
one is better. This task may in fact be the more natu-
ral one, since in most applications the main concern
is with the relative quality of articles rather than their
absolute scores. This setting is also beneficial in
terms of data use, because each pair of articles with
different average readability scores now becomes a
data point for the classification task.
We thus create a classification problem: given two
articles, is article 1 more readable than article 2?
For each pair of texts whose readability ratings on
the 1 to 5 scale differed by at least 0.5, we form
one data point for the ranking problem, resulting in
243 examples. The predictors are the differences be-
tween the two articles’ features. For classification,
we used WEKA’s linear support vector implemen-
tation (SMO) and performance was evaluated using
10-fold cross-validation.
Features Accuracy
None (Majority Class) 50.21%

Table 7: SVM prediction accuracy, linear kernel
The classification results are shown in Table 7.
When all features are used for prediction, the ac-
curacy is high, 88.88%. The length of the article
can serve as a baseline feature—longer articles are
ranked lower by the assessors, so this feature can
be taken as baseline indicator of readability. Only
six features used by themselves lead to accuracies
higher than the length baseline. These results indi-
cate that the most important individual factors in the
readability ranking task, in decreasing order of im-
portance, are log likelihood of discourse relations,
number of discourse relations, N-O transitions, O-N
193
transitions, average number of VPs per sentence and
text probability under a general language model.
In terms of classes of features, the 16 entity
grid features perform the best, leading to an accu-
racy of 79.41%, followed by the combination of
the four discourse features (77.36%), and syntax
features (74.07%). This is evidence for the fact
that there is a complex interplay between readabil-
ity factors: the entity grid factors which individ-
ually have very weak correlation with readability
combine well, while adding the three additional dis-
course features to the likelihood of discourses rela-
tions actually worsens performance slightly. Simi-
lar indication for interplay between features is pro-
vided by the class ablation classification results, in
which classes of features are removed. Surprisingly,
removing syntactic features causes the biggest dete-
rioration in performance, a drop in accuracy from
88.88% to 82.71%. The removal of vocabulary,
length, or discourse features has a minimal negative
impact on performance, while removing the cohe-
sion features actually boosts performance.
7 Conclusion
We have investigated which linguistic features cor-
relate best with readability judgments. While sur-
face measures such as the average number of words
per sentence or the average number of characters
per word are not good predictors, there exist syn-
tactic, semantic, and discourse features that do cor-
relate highly. The average number of verb phrases
in each sentence, the number of words in the article,
the likelihood of the vocabulary, and the likelihood
of the discourse relations all are highly correlated
with humans’ judgments of how well an article is
written.
While using any one out of syntactic, lexical, co-
herence, or discourse features is substantally better
than the baseline surface features on the discrim-
ination task, using a combination of entity coher-
ence and discourse relations produces the best per-
formance.
