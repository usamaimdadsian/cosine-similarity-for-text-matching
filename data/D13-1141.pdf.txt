Abstract
We introduce bilingual word embeddings: se-
mantic embeddings associated across two lan-
guages in the context of neural language mod-
els. We propose a method to learn bilingual
embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus,
while utilizing MT word alignments to con-
strain translational equivalence. The new em-
beddings significantly out-perform baselines
in word semantic similarity. A single semantic
similarity feature induced with bilingual em-
beddings adds near half a BLEU point to the
results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine
translation task.
1 Introduction
It is difficult to recognize and quantify semantic sim-
ilarities across languages. The Fr-En phrase-pair
{‘un cas de force majeure’, ‘case of absolute neces-
sity’}, Zh-En phrase pair {‘????’,‘persist in a
stubborn manner’} are similar in semantics. If co-
occurrences of exact word combinations are rare in
the training parallel text, it can be difficult for classi-
cal statistical MT methods to identify this similarity,
or produce a reasonable translation given the source
phrase.
We introduce an unsupervised neural model
to learn bilingual semantic embedding for words
across two languages. As an extension to their
monolingual counter-part (Turian et al., 2010;
Huang et al., 2012; Bengio et al., 2003), bilin-
gual embeddings capture not only semantic infor-
mation of monolingual words, but also semantic re-
lationships across different languages. This prop-
erty allows them to define semantic similarity met-
rics across phrase-pairs, making them perfect fea-
tures for machine translation.
To learn bilingual embeddings, we use a new ob-
jective function which embodies both monolingual
semantics and bilingual translation equivalence. The
latter utilizes word alignments, a natural sub-task
in the machine translation pipeline. Through large-
scale curriculum training (Bengio et al., 2009), we
obtain bilingual distributed representations which
lie in the same feature space. Embeddings of di-
rect translations overlap, and semantic relationships
across bilingual embeddings were further improved
through unsupervised learning on a large unlabeled
corpus.
Consequently, we produce for the research com-
munity a first set of Mandarin Chinese word embed-
dings with 100,000 words trained on the Chinese
Gigaword corpus. We evaluate these embedding
on Chinese word semantic similarity from SemEval-
2012 (Jin and Wu, 2012). The embeddings sig-
nificantly out-perform prior work and pruned tf-idf
base-lines. In addition, the learned embeddings
give rise to 0.11 F1 improvement in Named Entity
Recognition on the OntoNotes dataset (Hovy et al.,
2006) with a neural network model.
We apply the bilingual embeddings in an end-to-
end phrase-based MT system by computing seman-
tic similarities between phrase pairs. On NIST08
Chinese-English translation task, we obtain an im-
provement of 0.48 BLEU from a competitive base-
line (30.01 BLEU to 30.49 BLEU) with the Stanford
Phrasal MT system.

2 Review of prior work
Distributed word representations are useful in NLP
applications such as information retrieval (Pas¸ca et
al., 2006; Manning et al., 2008), search query ex-
pansions (Jones et al., 2006), or representing se-
mantics of words (Reisinger et al., 2010). A num-
ber of methods have been explored to train and ap-
ply word embeddings using continuous models for
language. Collobert et al. (2008) learn embed-
dings in an unsupervised manner through a con-
trastive estimation technique. Mnih and Hinton (
2008), Morin and Bengio ( 2005) proposed efficient
hierarchical continuous-space models. To system-
atically compare embeddings, Turian et al. (2010)
evaluated improvements they bring to state-of-the-
art NLP benchmarks. Huang et al. (2012) intro-
duced global document context and multiple word
prototypes. Recently, morphology is explored to
learn better word representations through Recursive
Neural Networks (Luong et al., 2013).
Bilingual word representations have been ex-
plored with hand-designed vector space mod-
els (Peirsman and Pado´ , 2010; Sumita, 2000),
and with unsupervised algorithms such as LDA and
LSA (Boyd-Graber and Resnik, 2010; Tam et al.,
2007; Zhao and Xing, 2006). Only recently have
continuous space models been applied to machine
translation (Le et al., 2012). Despite growing in-
terest in these models, little work has been done
along the same lines to train bilingual distributioned
word represenations to improve machine translation.
In this paper, we learn bilingual word embeddings
which achieve competitive performance on seman-
tic word similarity, and apply them in a practical
phrase-based MT system.
3 Algorithm and methods
3.1 Unsupervised training with global context
Our method starts with embedding learning formu-
lations in Collobert et al. (2008). Given a context
window c in a document d, the optimization mini-
mizes the following Context Objective for a word w
in the vocabulary:
J (c,d)CO =
?
wr?VR
max(0, 1? f(cw, d) + f(cwr , d))
(1)
Here f is a function defined by a neural network.
wr is a word chosen in a random subset VR of the
vocabulary, and cwr is the context window contain-
ing word wr. This unsupervised objective func-
tion contrasts the score between when the correct
word is placed in context with when a random word
is placed in the same context. We incorporate the
global context information as in Huang et al. (2012),
shown to improve performance of word embed-
dings.
3.2 Bilingual initialization and training
In the joint semantic space of words across two lan-
guages, the Chinese word ‘??’ is expected to be
close to its English translation ‘government’. At the
same time, when two words are not direct transla-
tions, e.g. ‘lake’ and the Chinese word ‘?’ (deep
pond), their semantic proximity could be correctly
quantified.
We describe in the next sub-sections the methods
to intialize and train bilingual embeddings. These
methods ensure that bilingual embeddings retain
their translational equivalence while their distribu-
tional semantics are improved during online training
with a monolingual corpus.
3.2.1 Initialization by MT alignments
First, we use MT Alignment counts as weighting
to initialize Chinese word embeddings. In our ex-
periments, we use MT word alignments extracted
with the Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al., 2006) 1.
Specifically, we use the following equation to com-
pute starting word embeddings:
Wt-init =
S
?
s=1
Cts + 1
Ct + S
Ws (2)
In this equation, S is the number of possible tar-
get language words that are aligned with the source
word. Cts denotes the number of times when word t
in the target and word s in the source are aligned in
the training parallel text; Ct denotes the total num-
ber of counts of word t that appeared in the target
language. Finally, Laplace smoothing is applied to
this weighting function.

evaluation in the past 5 years
1394
Single-prototype English embeddings by Huang
et al. (2012) are used to initialize Chinese em-
beddings. The initialization readily provides a set
(Align-Init) of benchmark embeddings in experi-
ments (Section 4), and ensures translation equiva-
lence in the embeddings at start of training.
3.2.2 Bilingual training
Using the alignment counts, we form alignment
matrices Aen?zh and Azh?en. For Aen?zh, each
row corresponds to a Chinese word, and each col-
umn an English word. An element aij is first as-
signed the counts of when the ith Chinese word is
aligned with the jth English word in parallel text.
After assignments, each row is normalized such that
it sums to one. The matrix Azh?en is defined sim-
ilarly. Denote the set of Chinese word embeddings
as Vzh, with each row a word embedding, and the
set of English word embeddings as Ven. With the
two alignment matrices, we define the Translation
Equivalence Objective:
JTEO-en?zh = ?Vzh ?Aen?zhVen?2 (3)
JTEO-zh?en = ?Ven ?Azh?enVzh?2 (4)
We optimize for a combined objective during train-
ing. For the Chinese embeddings we optimize for:
JCO-zh + ?JTEO-en?zh (5)
For the English embeddings we optimize for:
JCO-en + ?JTEO-zh?en (6)
During bilingual training, we chose the value of ?
such that convergence is achieved for both JCO and
JTEO. A small validation set of word similarities
from (Jin and Wu, 2012) is used to ensure the em-
beddings have reasonable semantics. 2
In the next sections, ‘bilingual trained’ embed-
dings refer to those initialized with MT alignments
and trained with the objective defined by Equa-
tion 5. ‘Monolingual trained’ embeddings refer to
those intialized by alignment but trained without
JTEO-en?zh.
2In our experiments, ? = 50.
3.3 Curriculum training
We train 100k-vocabulary word embeddings using
curriculum training (Turian et al., 2010) with Equa-
tion 5. For each curriculum, we sort the vocabu-
lary by frequency and segment the vocabulary by a
band-size taken from {5k, 10k, 25k, 50k}. Separate
bands of the vocabulary are trained in parallel using
minibatch L-BFGS on the Chinese Gigaword cor-
pus 3. We train 100,000 iterations for each curricu-
lum, and the entire 100k vocabulary is trained for
500,000 iterations. The process takes approximately
19 days on a eight-core machine. We show visual-
ization of learned embeddings overlaid with English
in Figure 1. The two-dimensional vectors for this vi-
sualization is obtained with t-SNE (van der Maaten
and Hinton, 2008). To make the figure comprehen-
sible, subsets of Chinese words are provided with
reference translations in boxes with green borders.
Words across the two languages are positioned by
the semantic relationships implied by their embed-
dings.
Figure 1: Overlaid bilingual embeddings: English words
are plotted in yellow boxes, and Chinese words in green;
reference translations to English are provided in boxes
with green borders directly below the original word.
4 Experiments
4.1 Semantic Similarity
We evaluate the Mandarin Chinese embeddings with
the semantic similarity test-set provided by the or-
3Fifth Edition. LDC catelog number LDC2011T13. We only
exclude cna cmn, the Traditional Chinese segment of the cor-
pus.

The results for semantic similarity are shown in
Table 1. We show two evaluation metrics: Spear-
man Correlation and Kendall’s Tau. For both, bilin-
gual embeddings trained with the combined objec-
tive defined by Equation 5 perform best. For pruned
tf-idf, we follow Reisinger et al. (2010; Huang et
al. (2012) and count word co-occurrences in a 10-
word window. We use the best results from a
range of pruning and feature thresholds to compare
against our method. The bilingual and monolingual
trained embeddings4 out-perform pruned tf-idf by
14.1 and 12.6 Spearman Correlation (×100), respec-
tively. Further, they out-perform embeddings initial-
ized from alignment by 7.9 and 6.4. Both our tf-idf
implementation and the word embeddings have sig-
nificantly higher Kendall’s Tau value compared to
Prior work (Jin and Wu, 2012). We verified Tau cal-
culations with original submissions provided by the
authors.
4.2 Named Entity Recognition
We perform NER experiments on OntoNotes (v4.0)
(Hovy et al., 2006) to validate the quality of the
Chinese word embeddings. Our experimental set-
up is the same as Wang et al. (2013). With em-
beddings, we build a naive feed-forward neural net-
work (Collobert et al., 2008) with 2000 hidden neu-
rons and a sliding window of five words. This naive
setting, without sequence modeling or sophisticated
4Due to variations caused by online minibatch L-BFGS, we
take embeddings from five random points out of last 105 mini-
batch iterations, and average their semantic similarity results.

join optimization, is not competitive with state-of-
the-art (Wang et al., 2013). Table 2 shows that the
bilingual embeddings obtains 0.11 F1 improvement,
lagging monolingual, but significantly better than
Align-Init (as in Section3.2.1) on the NER task.
4.3 Vector matching alignment
Translation equivalence of the bilingual embeddings
is evaluated by naive word alignment to match word
embeddings by cosine distance.5 The Alignment Er-
ror Rates (AER) reported in Table 3 suggest that
bilingual training using Equation 5 produces embed-
dings with better translation equivalence compared
to those produced by monolingual training.
4.4 Phrase-based machine translation
Our experiments are performed using the Stan-
ford Phrasal phrase-based machine translation sys-
tem (Cer et al., 2010). In addition to NIST08 train-
ing data, we perform phrase extraction, filtering
and phrase table learning with additional data from
GALE MT evaluations in the past 5 years. In turn,
our baseline is established at 30.01 BLEU and rea-
sonably competitive relative to NIST08 results. We
use Minimum Error Rate Training (MERT) (Och,
2003) to tune the decoder.
In the phrase-based MT system, we add one fea-
ture to bilingual phrase-pairs. For each phrase, the
word embeddings are averaged to obtain a feature
vector. If a word is not found in the vocabulary, we
disregard and assume it is not in the phrase; if no
word is found in a phrase, a zero vector is assigned
5This is evaluated on 10,000 randomly selected sentence
pairs from the MT training set.

to it. We then compute the cosine distance between
the feature vectors of a phrase pair to form a seman-
tic similarity feature for the decoder.
Results on NIST08 Chinese-English translation
task are reported in Table 46. An increase of
0.48 BLEU is obtained with semantic similarity
with bilingual embeddings. The increase is modest,
just surpassing a reference standard deviation 0.29
BLEU Cer et al. (2010)7 evaluated on a similar sys-
tem. We intend to publish further analysis on statis-
tical significance of this result as an appendix. From
these suggestive evidence in the MT results, random
initialized monolingual trained embeddings add lit-
tle gains to the baseline. Bilingual initialization and
training seem to be offering relatively more consis-
tent gains by introducing translational equivalence.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce bilingual word embed-
dings through initialization and optimization con-
straint using MT alignments The embeddings are
learned through curriculum training on the Chinese
Gigaword corpus. We show good performance on
Chinese semantic similarity with bilingual trained
embeddings. When used to compute semantic simi-
larity of phrase pairs, bilingual embeddings improve
NIST08 end-to-end machine translation results by
just below half a BLEU point. This implies that se-
mantic embeddings are useful features for improv-
ing MT systems. Further, our results offer sugges-
tive evidence that bilingual word embeddings act as
high-quality semantic features and embody bilingual
translation equivalence across languages.
