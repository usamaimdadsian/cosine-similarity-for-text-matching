Abstract
Social media is a rich source of rumours
and corresponding community reactions.
Rumours reflect different characteristics,
some shared and some individual. We for-
mulate the problem of classifying tweet
level judgements of rumours as a super-
vised learning task. Both supervised and
unsupervised domain adaptation are con-
sidered, in which tweets from a rumour are
classified on the basis of other annotated
rumours. We demonstrate how multi-task
learning helps achieve good results on ru-
mours from the 2011 England riots.
1 Introduction
There is an increasing need to interpret and act
upon rumours spreading quickly through social
media, especially in circumstances where their ve-
racity is hard to establish. For instance, during an
earthquake in Chile rumours spread through Twit-
ter that a volcano had become active and that there
was a tsunami warning in Valparaiso (Mendoza et
al., 2010). Other examples, from the riots in Eng-
land in 2011, were that rioters were going to attack
Birmingham’s children hospital and that animals
had escaped from the zoo (Procter et al., 2013).
Social scientists (Procter et al., 2013) analysed
manually a sample of tweets expressing different
judgements towards rumours and categorised them
manually in supporting, denying or questioning.
The goal here is to carry out tweet-level judge-
ment classification automatically, in order to assist
in (near) real-time rumour monitoring by journal-
ists and authorities (Procter et al., 2013). In ad-
dition, information about tweet-level judgements
has been used as a first step for early rumour de-
tection by (Zhao et al., 2015).
The focus here is on tweet-level judgement clas-
sification on unseen rumours, based on a training
text position

set of other already annotated rumours. Previous
work on this problem either considered unrealis-
tic settings ignoring temporal ordering and rumour
identities (Qazvinian et al., 2011) or proposed reg-
ular expressions as a solution (Zhao et al., 2015).
We expect posts expressing similar opinions to ex-
hibit many similar characteristics across different
rumours. Based on the assumption of a common
underlying linguistic signal, we build a transfer
learning system that labels newly emerging ru-
mours for which we have little or no annotated
data. Results demonstrate that Gaussian Process-
based multi task learning allows for significantly
improved performance.
The novel contributions of this paper are:
1. Formulating the problem of classifying judge-
ments of rumours in both supervised and unsuper-
vised domain adaptation settings. 2. Showing how
a multi-task learning approach outperforms single-
task methods.
2 Related work
In the context of rumour spread in social media,
researchers have studied differences in informa-
2590
tion flows between content of varying credibility.
For instance, Procter et al. (2013) grouped source
tweets and re-tweets into information flows (Lotan
et al., 2011), then ranked these by flow size, as
a proxy of significance. Information flows were
then categorised manually. Along similar vein,
Mendoza et al. (2010) found that users deal with
true and false rumours differently: the former are
affirmed more than 90% of the time, whereas the
latter are challenged (questioned or denied) 50%
of the time. Friggeri et al. (2014) analyzed a set
rumours from the Snopes.com website that have
been matched to Facebook public conversations.
They concluded that false rumours are more likely
to receive a comment with link to Snopes.com
website. However, none of the above attempted
to automatically classify rumours.
With respect to automatic methods for detect-
ing misinformation and disinformation in social
media, Ratkiewicz et al. (2011) detect political
abuse (a kind of disinformation) spread through
Twitter. The task is defined in purely information
diffusion settings and is not necessarily related
with the truthfulness of the piece of information.
Castillo et al. (2013) proposed methods for identi-
fying newsworthy information cascades on Twitter
and then classifying these cascades as credible and
not credible. The main difference from our task is
that credibility classification is carried out over the
entire information cascade, classified objects are
not necessarily rumours and no explicit judgement
classification was performed in their approach.
Early rumour identification is the focus of Zhao
et al. (2015), where regular expressions are used
for finding questioning and denying tweets as a
key pre-requisite step for rumour detection. Un-
fortunately, when we applied these regular expres-
sions on our dataset, they yielded only 16% recall
for questioning and 14% recall for denying tweets.
Consequently, this motivated us to seek a better
approach to tweet-level classification.
The work most relevant to ours is due
to Qazvinian et al. (2011). Their method first
carries out rumour retrieval, whereby tweets are
classified into rumour related and non-rumour re-
lated. Next, rumour-related tweets are classified
into supporting and not-supporting. The classi-
fier is trained by ignoring rumour identities, i.e.,
pooling together tweets from all rumours, and ig-
noring the temporal dependencies between tweets.
In contrast, we formulate the rumour classifica-

tion problem as transfer learning, where unseen
rumours (or rumours with few initial tweets ob-
served) are classified using already known ru-
mours – a much harder and more practical setting.
Moreover, unlike Qazvinian et al. (2011), we con-
sider the multi-class classification problem and do
not collaps questioning and denying tweets into a
single class, since they differ significantly.
3 Data
We evaluate our work on several rumours circu-
lating on Twitter during the England riots in 2011
(see Table 2). The dataset was analysed and an-
notated manually as supporting, questioning, or
denying a rumour, by a team of social scientists
studying the role of social media during the riots
(Procter et al., 2013). The original dataset also
included commenting tweets, but these have been
removed from our experiments due to their small
number (they constituted only 5% of the corpus).
As can be seen from the dataset overview in
Table 2, different rumours exhibit varying pro-
portions of supporting, denying and questioning
tweets, which was also observed in other studies of
rumours (Mendoza et al., 2010; Qazvinian et al.,
2011). These variations in majority classes across
rumours underscores the modeling challenge in
tweet-level classification of rumour attitudes.
With respect to veracity, one rumour has been
confirmed as true (Miss Selfridge’s being on fire),
one is unsubstantiated (police beat girl), and the
remaining five are known to be false. Note, how-
ever, that the focus here is not on classifying truth-
fulness, but instead on identifying the attitude ex-
pressed in each tweet towards the rumour.

4 Problem formulation
Let R be a set of rumours, each of which consists
of tweets discussing it, ?
r?R
T
r
= {t
r
1
, · · · , t
r
r
n
}.
T = ?
r?R
T
r
is the complete set of tweets from all
rumours. Each tweet is classified as supporting,
denying or questioning with respect to its rumour:
y(t) ? {0, 1, 2}, where 0 denotes supporting, 1
means denying and 2 denotes questioning.
First, we consider the Leave One Out (LOO)
setting, which means that for each rumour r ? R,
we construct the test set equal to T
r
and the train-
ing set equal to T \ T
r
. Therefore this is a very
challenging and realistic scenario, where the test
set contains an entirely unseen rumour, from those
in the training set.
The second setting is Leave Part Out (LPO).
In this formulation, a very small number of ini-
tial tweets from the target rumour is added to the
training set {t
r
1
, · · · , t
r
r
k
}. This scenario becomes
applicable typically soon after a rumour breaks
out and journalists have started monitoring and
analysing the related tweet stream. The experi-
ments section investigates how the number of ini-
tial training tweets influences classification perfor-
mance on a fixed test set, namely: {t
r
r
l
, · · · , t
r
r
n
},
l > k.
The tweet-level classification problem here as-
sumes that tweets from the training set are already
labelled with the rumour discussed and the atti-
tude expressed towards that. This information can
be acquired either via manual annotation as part
of expert analysis, as is the case with our dataset,
or automatically, e.g. using pattern-based rumour
detection (Zhao et al., 2015). Afterwards, our
method can be used to classify the attitudes ex-
pressed in each new tweet from outside the train-
ing set.
5 Gaussian Processes for Classification
Gaussian Processes are a Bayesian non-parametric
machine learning framework that has been shown
to work well for a range of NLP problems, of-
ten beating other state-of-the-art methods (Cohn
and Specia, 2013; Lampos et al., 2014; Beck et
al., 2014; Preotiuc-Pietro et al., 2015). We use
Gaussian Processes as this probabilistic kernelised
framework avoids the need for expensive cross-
validation for hyperparameter selection.
1
1
There exist frequentist kernel methods, like SVMs,
which additionally require extensive heldout parameter tun-
ing.
The central concept of Gaussian Process
Classification (GPC; (Rasmussen and Williams,
2005)) is a latent function f over inputs
x: f(x) ? GP(m(x), k(x,x
?
)), where m is the
mean function, assumed to be 0 and k is the kernel
function, specifying the degree to which the out-
puts covary as a function of the inputs. We use a
linear kernel, k(x,x
?
) = ?
2
x
>
x
?
. The latent func-
tion is then mapped by the probit function ?(f)
into the range [0, 1], such that the resulting value
can be interpreted as p(y = 1|x).
The GPC posterior is calculated as
p(f
?
|X,y,x
?
) =
?
p(f
?
|X,x
?
, f)
p(y|f)p(f)
p(y|X)
df ,
where p(y|f) =
n
?
j=1
?(f
j
)
y
j
(1??(f
j
))
1?y
j
is the
Bernoulli likelihood of class y. After calculating
the above posterior from the training data, this is
used in prediction, i.e.,
p(y
?
=1|X,y,x
?
)=
?
? (f
?
) p (f
?
|X,y,x
?
) df
?
.
The above integrals are intractable and approx-
imation techniques are required to solve them.
There exist various methods to deal with calculat-
ing the posterior; here we use Expectation Prop-
agation (EP; (Minka and Lafferty, 2002)). In EP,
the posterior is approximated by a fully factorised
distribution, where each component is assumed to
be an unnormalised Gaussian.
In order to conduct multi-class classification,
we perform a one-vs-all classification for each la-
bel and then assign the one with the highest like-
lihood, amongst the three (supporting, denying,
questioning). We choose this method due to inter-
pretability of results, similar to recent work on oc-
cupational class classification (Preotiuc-Pietro et
al., 2015).
Intrinsic Coregionalization Model In the LPO
setting initial labelled tweets from the target ru-
mour are observed as well. In this case, we pro-
pose to weight the importance of tweets from the
reference rumours depending on how similar their
characteristics are to the tweets from the target ru-
mour available for training. To handle this with
GPC, we use a multiple output model based on the
Intrinsic Coregionalisation Model (ICM; (
´
Alvarez
et al., 2012)). It has already been applied suc-
cessfully to NLP regression problems (Beck et al.,
2014) and it can also be applied to classification
2592
ones. ICM parametrizes the kernel by a matrix
which represents the extent of covariance between
pairs of tasks. The complete kernel takes form of
k((x, d), (x
?
, d
?
)) = k
data
(x,x
?
)B
d,d
?
,
where B is a square coregionalization matrix, d
and d
?
denote the tasks of the two inputs and k
data
is a kernel for comparing inputs x and x
?
(here, lin-
ear). We parametrize the coregionalization matrix
B = ?I + vv
T
, where v specifies the correlation
between tasks and the vector ? controls extent of
task independence.
Hyperparameter selection We tune hyperpa-
rameters v, ? and ?
2
by maximizing evidence of
the model p(y|X), thus having no need for a vali-
dation set.
Methods We consider GPs in three different set-
tings, varying in what data the model is trained on
and what kernel it uses. The first setting (denoted
GP) considers only target rumour data for train-
ing. The second (GPPooled) additionally consid-
ers tweets from reference rumours (i.e. other than
the target rumour). The third setting is GPICM,
where an ICM kernel is used to weight influence
from tweets from reference rumours.
6 Features
We conducted a series of preprocessing steps in or-
der to address data sparsity. All words were low-
ercased; stopwords removed; all emoticons were
replaced with words
2
; and stemming was per-
formed. In addition, multiple occurrences of a
character were replaced with a double occurrence
(Agarwal et al., 2011), to correct for misspellings
and lengthenings, e.g., looool. All punctuation
was also removed, except for ., ! and ?, which we
hypothesize to be important for expressing emo-
tion. Lastly, usernames were removed as they tend
to be rumour-specific, i.e., very few users com-
ment on more than one rumour.
After preprocessing the text data, we use either
the resulting bag of words (BOW) feature repre-
sentation or replace all words with their Brown
cluster ids (Brown), using 1000 clusters acquired
from a large scale Twitter corpus (Owoputi et al.,
2013). In all cases, simple re-tweets are removed
from the training set to prevent bias (Llewellyn et
al., 2014).

LOO setting.
7 Experiments and Discussion
Table 3 shows the mean accuracy in the LOO
scenario following the GPPooled method, which
pools all reference rumours together ignoring their
task identities. ICM can not use correlations to tar-
get rumour in this case and so can not be used. The
majority baseline simply assigns the most frequent
class from the training set.
We can observe that methods perform on a level
similar to majority vote, outperforming it only
slightly. This indicates how difficult the LOO task
is, when no annotated target rumour tweets are
available.
Figure 1 shows accuracy for a range of methods
as the number of tweets about the target rumour
used for training increases. Most notably, perfor-
mance increases from 70% to around 80%, after
only 10 annotated tweets from the target rumour
become available, as compared to the results on
unseen rumours from Table 3. However, as the
amount of target rumour increases, performance
does not increase further, which suggests that even
only 10 human-annotated tweets are enough to
achieve significant performance benefits. Note
also how the use of reference rumours is very im-
portant, as methods using only the target rumour
obtain accuracy similar to the Majority vote clas-
sifier (GP Brown and GP BOW).
The top performing methods are GPCIM and
GPPooled, where use of Brown clusters consis-
tently improves results for both methods over
BOW, irrespective of the number of tweets about
the target rumour annotated for training. More-
over, GPICM is better than GPPooled both with
Brown and BOW features and GPCIM with
Brown is ultimately the best performing of all.
In order to analyse the importance of Brown
clusters, Automatic Relevance Determination
(ARD) is used (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005)
for the best performing GPICM Brown in the LPO
scenario. Only the case where the first 10 tweets
are used for training is considered, since it already

performs very well. Using ARD, we learn a sepa-
rate length-scale for each feature, thus establishing
their importance. The weights learnt for differ-
ent clusters are averaged over the 7 rumours and
the top 5 Brown clusters for each label are shown
in Table 4. We can see that clusters around the
words fake and bullshit turn out to be important
for the denying class, and true for both supporting
and questioning classes. This reinforces our hy-
pothesis that common linguistic cues can be found
across multiple rumours. Note how punctuation
proves important as well, since clusters ? and !
are also very prominent.
8 Conclusions
This paper investigated the problem of classifying
judgements expressed in tweets about rumours.
First, we considered a setting where no training
data from target rumour is available (LOO). With-
out access to annotated examples of the target ru-
mour the learning problem becomes very difficult.
We showed that in the supervised domain adapta-
tion setting (LPO) even annotating a small number
of tweets helps to achieve better results. More-
over, we demonstrated the benefits of a multi task
learning approach, as well as that Brown cluster
features are more useful for the task than simple
bag of words.
Judgement estimation is undoubtedly of great
value e.g. for marketing, politics and journalism,
helping to target widely believed topics. Although
the focus here is on classifying community reac-
tions, Castillo et al. (2013) showed that commu-
nity reaction is correlated with actual rumour ve-
racity. Consequently our classification methods
may prove useful in the broader and more chal-
lenging task of annotating veracity.
An interesting direction for future work would
be adding non-textual features. For example, the
rumour diffusion pattern (Lukasik et al., 2015)
may be a useful cue for judgement classification.
