Abstract 
We present an operable definition of focus 
which is argued to be of a cognito-pragmatic 
nature and explore how it is determined in 
discourse in a formalized manner. For this 
purpose, a file card model of discourse model 
and knowledge store is introduced enabling the 
decomposition a d formal representation f its 
determination process as a programmable 
algorithm (FDA). Interdisciplinary evidence 
from social and cognitive psychology is cited 
and the prospect of the integration of focus via 
FDA as a discourse-level construct into speech 
synthesis systems, in particular, concept-to- 
speech systems, is also briefly discussed. 
1. Introduction 
The present paper aims to propose a working 
definition of focus and thereupon explore how focus 
is determined in discourse; in doing so, it hopes to 
contribute to the potential integration of a focus 
module into speech synthesis ystems, in particular, 
concept-to-speech ones. The motivation largely 
derives from the observation that focus, though 
recognized as 'the meeting point of linguistics and 
artificial intelligence' (Hajicova, 1987) carrying 
significant discourse information closely related to 
prosody generation, has nonetheless appeared evasive 
and intractable to formalization. Most current speech 
synthesis ystems imply take focus as the point of 
departure in an a priori manner whilst few have 
looked into the issue of how focus occurs as it is, 
namely, how focus is determined (by the speaker 
presumably) in the discourse. We aim to redress this 
inadequacy by first defining focus as a cognito- 
pragmatic ategory, which then enables a formal and 
procedural characterization of focus determination 
process in discourse, captured as focus determination 
algorithm (FDA). The FDA to be proposed is largely 
based on human-human dialogue (though space 
consideration precludes the full presentation of data), 
but is believed to be applicable to human-computer 
interaction as well. The study is characterized by its 
interdisciplinary approach, combining insights and 
inputs from linguistics, neuroscience and social 
psychology. 
2. Defining focus: a eognito-pragmatie 
category 
The term focus has been used in various senses, at 
least six of which can be identified, i.e., phonological 
(Pierrehumbert, 1980; Ladd, 1996), semantic 
(Jackendoff, 1972; Prince, 1985), syntactic 
(Rochemont, 1986), cognitive (Sanford & Garrod, 
1981; Musseler et al., 1995), pragmatic (Halliday, 
1967), and AI-focus (Grosz & Sidner, 1986) ~. We 
argue that, first, these multiple uses of focus, though 
resulting in conceptual confusion, hint at the central 
status of the notion in core as well as peripheral 
linguistics. Second, focus as occurs in discourse is 
best captured by referring to both the interlocutors' 
cognitive computation and constant interaction, in 
accordance with the dual (i.e., cognitive and 
pragmatic) nature of discourse per se (Nuyts, 1992). 
Of the six above-mentioned senses, the cognitive and 
pragmatic ones serve as the basis for the present 
definition, although the caveat is immediately made 
that the two aspects are to be fully integrated rather 
than merely added together. Moreover, neither is to be 
adopted blindly given certain shortcomings of 
previous accounts of each, such as a general 
vagueness militating against their effective 
application in speech technology. 
In this connection, we define focus as a cognito- 
pragmatic ategory, calling for the introduction of the 
cognitive construct of discourse model in relation to 
knowledge store. Presumably, every typical adult 
communicator has at his/her disposal a vast and 
extensive knowledge store relating to the scenes and 
events occurring in the world he/she is in. The 
contents of the store are acquired via direct perception 
of the environment and, less directly, communication 
with others or reflection upon past acquisitions. 
Discourse ntails the employment and deployment of 
the knowledge store, but in a specific discourse only a 
subset of it deemed relevant to the on-going discourse 
is incurred, given the economy principle of human 
cognitive system (Wilkes, 1997). We refer to this 
subset of knowledge store (KS) in operation for and in 
a given discourse as discourse model (DM) and hold 
it as bearing directly on focus. Following Levelt 
(1989:114), DM is 'a speaker's record of what he 
believes to be shared knowledge about he content of 
the discourse as it evolved' (my italics). Thus, it is a 
cognitive construct incorporating an interactive 
dimension of speaker-hearer mutual assessment; i  is 
also an ongoing, dynamic one being constantly 
Though it needs to be cautioned that such a division into these six 
senses is more an analytic expedient than implying there is clear-cut 
boundaries between them.

updated as discourse progresses. Similarly, the DM 
and the KS are related in a dynamic way allowing for 
potentially constant, on-line interaction during the 
discourse which we refer to as 'dynamic inclusion'. 
This implies that when 'off-l ine' (i.e., when no 
discourse is actively going on), DM is included in KS, 
as indicated in Figure 1 below. By comparison, when 
'on-line' (i.e., when participants are engaged in a 
discourse), the dynamic dimension becomes evident 
in both their inter-relation and the internal structuring 
of  DM, as illustrated in Figure 2.

IAZ 
Figure 2 deserves more explanation as the on- 
line state of and potential operations on the DM serve 
as the basis for focus determination in actual 
discourse. We argue that DM is crucially structured 
internally and for its representation we adopt the file 
card model based on the file metaphor in Heim (1983) 
(cf. also Reinhart, 1981; Vallduvi, 1992; Erteschik- 
Shir, 1997). A DM consists of a stack of  file cards, 
and each card contains (maximally) three categories 
of  items, viz., discourse referent (serving as index to 
and address of the card), attribute(s) and link(s), the 
first being obligatory whilst the latter two optional. 
Moreover, a card has one and only one referent but 
may have none, one or more attributes and links. 
Borrowing the notion of activation from Chafe (1987), 
we distinguish three zones, i.e., activated zone (AZ), 
semi-activated zone (SAZ) and inactivated zone (IAZ), 
within the DM 2. Similar to the case of the DM-KS 
relation, the boundaries between the three zones are 
fluid rather than fixed, as is evident in Figure 2. 
Armed with these machinery, we thus define 
focus as 'whatever is in the activated zone (AZ)',  or, 
more precisely, whatever is at th e top of the stack in 
AZ of the (speaker's version of the hearer's) DM as a 
result of immediately recent operations such as 
retrieval and updating at a given moment in the 
discourse (Zuo, 1999). 
3. Focus determination algorithm (FDA) 
Apparently, this definition of focus also renders the 
process of focus determination fairly transparent. The 
postulation of  DM and KS enables the decomposition 
and characterization of the focus determination 
process in an explicit and formalized manner. 
Discourse is thereby reducible, to a considerable 
extent, to the operations on the file cards, most 
crucially, adding, updating, locating and relocating of  
the cards across the three zones. In this vein, a card 
that is newly added to AZ (note not what is in AZ), or 
an item that is newly entered onto a card already in 
AZ at a specific moment is assigned focus-hood, / f  
and only ~fthe time interval between current moment 
and the moment for the addition/entry is shorter than a 
time threshold set on independent cognitive grounds 
(see below for more discussion). This process of focus 
determination can be represented as the following 
algorithm.

Several notes are called for 3. First, what can be 
2 Again here we are aware of  the argument that activation is a 
continous rather than a discrete concept. 
Due to space limit we only discuss afew major points here; for an 
elaborate account of the algorithm, ret~r to Zuo (1999), 
258 
Proceedings of EACL '99 
assigned focus-hood? Obviously a slick (and vague) 
'idea or thought' misses the point here. A look at the 
internal organization of the DM again suggests the 
answer. Corresponding tothe content of the file card, 
four cases can be identified as to what can become the 
focus: (1) the discourse referent, (2) the attribute, (3) 
the link, and (4) the card as a whole. Note that this 
breakdown analysis meshes well with findings in 
psycholinguistic researches, for example, the possible 
candidates for acquiring 'conceptual prominence' 
distinguished in Levelt (1989:151). The file card 
model offers a more rigorous and operable way to 
account for such cases: Lines 16-18 and 20-23 
respectively capture the above-mentioned cases (1) 
and (4) (though the former is apparently also a special 
type of case (4)) whilst Lines 29-31 and 36-38 
respectively represent cases (2) and (3). Note that 
lines 16-18 and 20-23 show that a card may be added 
to Az (and hence assigned focus-hood) either ad 
externo r by retrieving from SAZ or IAZ of the current 
DM. 
Second, a crucial assumption of this algorithm is 
that speech planning consists of conceptual planning 
and linguistic planning proceeding in a sequential 
fashion; this is a well-established argument in psycho- 
linguistics (Garrett, 1980), and the former proceeds in 
a unit-by-unit fashion (though the picture is more 
complicated for the latter) (Taylor & Taylor, 1990). 
Hence, the 'message unit' used in this algorithm (see 
Lines 2, 6, and 9) refers to such planning unit and can 
be roughly understood as 'chunk of meaning'; as such 
it consists minimally of a referent and an attribute 
while the link is optional; The 'ender' in Line 2 refers 
to the message unit intended by the speaker to 
terminate his/her current contribution. Obviously, 
here the speaker's intention plays a vital role. Note 
that the ender is also a conceptual unit in nature, and 
we leave open the question whether such enders 
constitute a closed, limited set with a relatively small 
number ofprototypical units. 
Third, the formula Ci = R i (+A i) (+L i) in Line 11 
indicates the make-up of the card, with the brackets 
standing for optionality (see Section 2). Also in this 
line, the function COMPARE (a, b) is defined as 
COMPARE a AGAINST b. {CAz}(and {CsAz}, {C~z} in the 
remainder of the algorithm) stands for the set 
comprised by the file cards already in AZ (or SAZ and 
IAZ, for that matter) at the current moment. 
Fourth, Ta (LI7), T, (Ls 22, 36) and To (L39) refer to a 
point in time, in comparison with Y t (L38) which is an 
interval of time. They serve as input to the Card 
Manager sub-program which keeps track of the 
'transportation', i.e., retrieval and deposition, of the 
cards. Thus, the RECORD (time) function (Ls 17, 22, 30, 
and 37), together with the Card Manager, takes care of 
the on-line shuffling and reshuffling of the file cards 
and is mainly responsible for the dynamism of DM. 
Regarding the choice of the threshold time Tt (L39), 
we argue that it is presumably the critical time 
conditioned by the capacity of the working memory; 
but we leave open its specific value and on what 
terms, absolute or relative, it should be defined (for 
different views, cf. Carpenter, 1988; Liebert, 1997; 
Givon, 1983; Barbosa & Bailly, 1994). At present, 
the commonly-employed practice (which is also that 
adopted here) is to set a time threshold in terms of the 
length of some independently delimited discourse 
segments (e.g. those in Rhetoric Structure Theory 
(Hirscheberg, 1993)). We admit this inadequacy and 
wish to address it fully with inputs from 
interdisciplinary researches in the future. 
Finally, the ~Z, SAZ and IaZ in the algorithm 
refer to the heater's DM as assessed by the speaker in 
discourse, i.e., the speaker's version of the hearer's 
DM, as the bearer's true DM is only accessible to s/he 
her/himself. 
4. Evidence from social and cognitive 
psychology 
Crucially, the validity of FDA is contingent on (i) to 
what extent it is possible for the speaker to 
conceptualize the heater's DM and (ii) on what 
independent grounds is the tripartite division of the 
DM justified? For the former question we invoke the 
notion of intersubjectivity from social psychology and 
for the latter, research findings in cognitive 
psychology are cited. 
Stemming initially f~om the observation i social 
psychology that discourse participants have to 
constantly 'put themselves in each other's shoes' in 
order to achieve communicative goals (cf. 
Rommetveit, 1974; Clark, 1985), intersubjectivity is 
primarily concerned with perspective-taking, or, 
perspectivization (Sanders & Spooren 1997). It 
implies that discourse is a negotiating process and that 
understanding in discourse has to be sufficiently 
intersubjective. Hence, it is both necessary and 
possible for the speaker to assess the hearer's DM, and 
this is achieved through intersubjectivity. Admittedly, 
this process is not infallible, given Linell's (1995) 
observation regarding misunderstanding i  discourse; 
nonetheless, it can be carried out with relative 
sufficiency which primarily depends on the 
participants' communicative competence and their 
expectation ofthe discourse. 
A theory of discourse processing must also be a 
theory of cognition and memory; this is especially 
true for focus, given its attested relevance to memory. 
Researches on knowledge storage and processing in 
human memory in cognitive psychology have favored 
a dual memory system, i.e. working memory (WM) 
and long-term memory (LTM) (Baddeley, 1990) and a 
tripartite taxonomy of LTM into procedural, semantic, 
and episodic storage systems (Tulving, 1985). More- 
over, WM serves as a portal to early episodic memory, 
and both are characterized by a limited capacity and 
rapid decay: the content in WM is periodically emptied 
into first, early episodic memory, then long-term 
episodic memory system, and thereafter semantic 
memory system. (e.g. Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). 
259 
Proceedings of EACL '99 
This representation dovetails nicely with our present 
account of focus and FDA. Specifically, a rough 
parallel may be drawn between, first, WM and AZ, 
second, early episodic memory and s~ & IAz, third, 
long-term episodic memory & semantic memory and 
IAz & KS, and fourth, the dynamic working of 
knowledge processing and that of FDA, in particular 
the Card Manager which takes charge of the make-up 
of DM by constantly monitoring the timing and 
subsequently shuffling and reshuffling cards. 
5. Integration of a focus module into speech 
synthesis ystems 
FDA, presented here on the basis of an operable 
definition of focus, enables the integration of a focus 
module into speech synthesis ystem; specifically, the 
output of FDA, i.e., the focus pattern of the message 
conveyed by the utterance, may be fed into a 
subsequent accent assignment module, one in the 
spirit of the Focus-Accent Theory of Dirksen (1992) 
and Dirksen & Quene (1993). 
In this way, FDA entertains a great potential for 
the integration of discourse-level information into 
prosody generation system, and thereby the 
production of more discourse-felicitous prosody. 
Moreover, given that FDA starts with conceptual 
planning of message, its integration is particularly 
suitable for Concept-to-speech systems. As a final 
note, we suggest hat its fundamental rationale is 
arguably also highly pertinent to Text-to-speech 
systems, which, however, cannot be elaborated here.
