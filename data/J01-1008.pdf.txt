The main asset of categorial grammar has traditionally been the close association 
between syntactic description on the one hand and a transparent and well-founded 
semantics on the other. Consequently, categorial grammar has primarily been favored 
by semantically oriented theorists and has arguably played an important role in the 
development of formal semantics for natural anguages (see, for example, Lewis \[1970\] 
and Montague \[1973\]). From the point of view of grammatical theory, however, frame- 
works based on categorial grammar have usually been problematic either by being too 
restricted in their expressive power or by not being restricted enough. Thus, classical 
categorial grammar, where the only permissible operation is functional application, 
is equivalent in expressive power to context-free phrase structure grammar and is 
therefore considered by most researchers as too restrictive. By contrast, the various 
extensions ometimes grouped under the heading of "flexible categorial grammar," 
which allow operations uch as functional composition and type raising, have been 
criticized for being too permissive. In the most extreme case, these extensions may 
result in permutation-completeness, meaning that any grammar will generate the per- 
mutation closure of the context-free language defined by the lexicon (van Benthem 
1986; Moortgat 1989). But even if this can be avoided, it is normally the case in these 
frameworks that one and the same string has multiple derivations resulting in the 
same semantic representation, a phenomenon which is often referred to as "spurious 
ambiguity." 
Mark Steedman, in his book The Syntactic Process, presents the framework of com- 
binatory categorial grammar (CCG), which attempts to steer a steady course between 
the Scylla of context-freeness and the Charybdis of permutation-completeness, using 
a suitably constrained set of operators. Moreover, Steedman argues that the alterna- 
tive derivations, far from being spurious, are needed to capture aspects of linguistic 
structure that have traditionally been neglected in grammatical theory, notably coordi- 
nation, parentheticals and, last but not least, intonation structure. This leads to a new 
conception of syntactic structure, which is no longer seen as an independent level 
of representation but rather as a trace of the process by which an interpretation is
derived. The claim is that different derivations of the same predicate-argument struc- 
ture actually correspond to different ways of structuring a content, something that is 
often reflected in the intonation structure of utterances. Steedman therefore proposes 
the term information structure for this notion of syntactic structure, which is claimed 
to unify the separate notions of surface structure and intonation structure postulated 
in other theories of grammar (see, for example, Selkirk \[1984\]). Another advantage 
of this unorthodox notion of constituent structure, according to the author, is that it 
directly supports incremental processing in such a way that every processing step cor-

responds to the construction of a complete constituent with a well-defined semantic 
interpretation. 
The book consists of 10 chapters, with Chapters 2-9 grouped into three parts and 
Chapter 1 as a general introduction. Part I (Chapters 2-5) is entitled "Grammar and 
Information Structure" and serves as a general introduction to CCG while at the same 
time developing the idea of syntactic structure as information structure. Chapter 2 
situates the approach within the broader tradition of generative grammar. Chapter 3 
introduces the technical machinery of CCG with motivating linguistic examples, and 
Chapter 4 defines the space of possible CCGs more exactly. These three chapters lead 
up to Chapter 5, where the argument is made in favor of an unorthodox derivation- 
based notion of syntactic structure capturing both information structure and intona- 
tion structure. Part II, "Coordination and Word Order," consists of two connected 
case studies, the first dealing with the notorious cross-serial dependencies in Dutch 
(Chapter 6), and the second dealing with gapping in English and Dutch (Chapter 7). 
Part IlI, "Computation and Performance," is devoted tO the processing of CCG and 
mainly deals with computational issues, although human linguistic performance is
also touched upon. Chapter 8 examines questions of expressive power, while Chap- 
ter 9 outlines a specific parsing architecture and makes the argument that CCGs, unlike 
most other competence grammars, can be used directly in semantically incremental 
parsing. Chapter 10, finally, summarizes the architecture of the theory as a whole and 
briefly discusses its role in acquisition and performance. 
This book will be of interest o theoretical and computational linguists alike, al- 
though its strength lies clearly on the theoretical side. It is true that most of Part III is 
devoted to the computational processing of CCG, but despite many interesting ideas, 
this part of the book remains somewhat inconclusive. For example, we are told that 
CCGs can be parsed in polynomial time with a worst-case complexity of O(n6), but 
this depends on results for linear indexed grammars by Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1990, 
1994) and an assumed equivalence between CCG and linear indexed grammars, which 
in turn depends on a certain way of interpreting the rule schemata for type raising in 
CCG. Similarly, the proposed parsing architecture involving a breadth-first incremen- 
tal parser combined with contextual disambiguation i order to reduce the amount 
of nondeterminism is interesting but still rather sketchy. And Part II, as pointed out 
by the author himself, is a self-contained and purely linguistic monograph, which 
is probably of less interest o most computationally oriented readers. I nevertheless 
claim that this is a book that deserves erious attention from both computational nd 
theoretical linguists, mainly on account of the material in Part I. As noted earlier, these 
four chapters erve a dual purpose. On the one hand, they form the introduction to 
CCG that, at least according to one of the quotes on the dust jacket, the community has 
been waiting for. On the other hand, they contain a very interesting theoretical pro- 
posal concerning the nature of syntactic structure, a proposal that not only integrates 
phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics but also takes computational spects 
into account. In this way, Steedman's book demonstrates very clearly that categorial 
grammar in general and CCG in particular is one of the most promising approaches 
available, both in the field of grammatical theory and in the domain of grammar-based 
natural anguage processing.
