Preface 
This volume contains the papers prepared for the Seventh Conference of the European Chapter of the 
Association for Computational Linguistics, held 27-31 March 1993 in Dublin, Ireland. 
The conference programme f atures invited talks, tutorials and submitted papers in the main session and 
in the student session. 
The Programme Committee for the main session received a large number of submissions from all over 
the world. The general quality of the submissions was high. Out of a total of 153 submissions for the 
main session, 36 were accepted. Almost without exception, each paper was reviewed by three referees. 
We trust that the resulting programme offers an inspiring and representative sample of current research 
in both the theoretical nd the applied aspects of the field. 
Due to the volume of submissions, the reviewing process was both time-consuming and difficult. We 
would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the program committee for taking on an 
average of 27 reviews and, in many cases, for contributing their own travel funds to attend the meeting 
of the program committee held at the University of Tfibingen:

We would also like to thank those colleagues who helped with the reviewing process at the request of 
members of the program committee. 
Many people contributed to the preparations of this meeting, and we are extremely grateful to them: 
Patrick Hanks, Stuart Shieber and Wolfgang Wahlster for the invited talks; Martin Kay, Shalom Lappin, 
and Alan Smeaton for giving tutorials; John Nerbonne for organising the tutorials; all ACL and EACL 
officials, for replying promptly to our frequent appeals for advice; Paul Jacobs and Steven Krauwer for 
providing reusable resources from previous ACL-affiliated meetings; Thorsten Brants for organising the 
student sessions. The student session is described in more detail in a separate preface (p. iv). 
Special thanks are due to Allan Ramsay and his assistants in Dublin for the preparation of these pro- 
ceedings and for handling the local organisation of the meeting. 
Local help in Tfibingen with preparing the papers for the committee and with mailings came from Iris 
Haberbosch, Katerina Magdou and Stephanie Schwarz. 
The meeting in Dublin is the first (E)ACL conference which offers support for students from the Don and 
Betty Walker International Student Fund to help defray costs for attending the meeting. We would like 
to take this opportunity to thank all contributors to the fund for their generous help. Your contributions 
are a tribute to the inspiration that the field of computational linguistics has received from the many 
years of dedication by Betty Walker and the late Don Walker. 
We dedicate these Proceedings to Betty and Don Walker.

Student Session 
Preface 
For the second time the European Conference of the ACL includes a student session. This part of the 
conference differs fl'om the main conference in its emphasis on promising work in progress and provides 
an opportunity for student researchers to receive valuable feedback on their work from other members of 
the computational linguistics community. 
We received 37 submissions for this student session, eight of which were accepted; one submission was 
accepted as a reserve paper. We allowed electronic submissions for the student session, and most of the 
authors (35 of 37) submitted electronically. Except for some minor formatting problems the committee 
had very good experiences with electronic reviewing and electronic-discussion. Wewould like to thank the 
authors for their submissions. An equally important contribution was made by the student programme 
committee. Every paper was read by at least hree of the 20 committee members. Thanks to their efforts, 
we were able to make a well-informed decision about which papers to select. 
Also we would like to thank the organizers of the main conference, who supported us with their advice 
throughout the preparations of the session. We welcome their decision to enlarge the student part from 
six to eight papers, which still left a strong competition between the authors.

Theory  and Implementat ion  of  F in i te -S ta te  Phono logy  
This two-part utorial presents a set of mathematical nd computational tools for manipulat- 
ing and reasoning about regular languages and regular elations and argues that they provide 
a solid basis for computational phonology. It shows in detail how this framework applies to 
ordered sets of context-sensitive rewriting rules and also to grammars in Koskenniemi's two- 
level formalism. This analysis provides a common representation f phonological constraints 
that supports efficient generation and recognition by a single interpreter.

Phonological Rule Systems," Computational Linguistics 20(3), 1994, 331-378.

Natura l  Language Process ing  and Information Retrieval 
The tutorial is aimed at an NLP audience v~ho want to find about a possible application area 
for NLP resources and techniques ... information retrieval. 
What is information retrieval ... functionality, including document retrieval, filtering, 
and routing ... application areas, present and perceived. Conventional approaches to IR 
... it is essential to see what other techniques have been used in IR to appreciate where 
NLP can/cannot be of use .... indexing techniques, boolean retrieval, vector space model, 
probabilistic modelling, term weighting and relevance feedback, query expansion, ranking. 
Storage structures ... this will be very short, just touching on the engineering problems of 
managing igabytes of text. 
Three sections cover the guts of the NLP-IR intersection and will be peppered with illus- 
trative examples. 
• Lexical resources/morphology in indexing by word senses, base forms, grammatical cat- 
egories, stemming. 
• Syntax in indexing and matching, phrase identification and extraction, phrase normali- 
sation and matching 
• Semantics in indexing and matching ... KR formalisms, examples of systems/prototypes 
which use higher-order NLP 
Issues of scale ... examples and illustrations of NLP-based IR (IR using NLP tools, techniques 
or resources) working on large scale collections, examples from TREC. 
Research issues and trends ... this section will be a discussion, led by me, on what I 
perceive as the directions in which the IR-NLP intersection will head.

Computational Approaches to Ellipsis 
The sentences in 1 illustrate three types of incomplete structures. 
la. John read the paper before Bill did. 
b. Max gave flowers to Lucy, and chocolates too. 
c. No student arrived, except John. 
la is an instance of VP ellipsis, lb is a case of "bare argument ellipsis"; and lc contains an 
exception phrase fragment. I will consider two possible approaches to developing a unified 
procedure for interpreting these distinct kinds of incomplete constituents. The first involves 
generating the semantic representation f an appropriate property or relation for the elided 
constituent fragment. The second attempts to reconstruct a syntactic representation f a VP 
or sentence containing the fragment. I will consider each approach in some detail, and argue 
that neither the semantic nor the syntactic view can handle all three types of incomplete 
constituent. 
I will provide motivation for the claim that VP ellipsis requires yntactic reconstruction, 
and that it is, in fact, a species of pseudo-gapping illustrated in 2. 
2. John gave flowers to Lucy before he did chocolates to Rosa. 
On this view, reconstruction is a relation between an elided VP and an equivalence class of 
lexically anchored syntactic structures which correspond to an antecedent VP. All elements of 
the equivalence lass exhibit he same syntactic structure, but variation among corresponding 
lexical anchors with respect o a restricted set of specified features i  possible. The syntactic 
structure of a (perhaps partially) elided VP is reconstructed byidentifying its elided head with 
the head of an antecedent VP, and then specifying a correspondence among the arguments 
and adjuncts of the antecedent head on one hand and those of the elided head on the other. I 
discuss the algorithm for VP ellipsis resolution presented in Lappin and McCord (1990) and 
extended in McCord et at. as an implementation f this analysis. 
I argue that, contrary to VP ellipsis, bare argument ellipsis must be resolved by means of 
a semantic procedure for predicate generation. I consider the higher-order unification analysis 
proposed in Dalrymple t al. (1991) as a possible account of this procedure. 
Finally, I present arguments for treating an exception phrase fragment not as an instance 
of ellipsis, but as a displaced NP modifier. NP storage (Cooper (1993), Pereira (1990), and 
Pereira and Pollock (1991)) provides a suitable device for expressing the connection between 
a displaced exceptior~ phrase and the NP which it modifies. 
The study of these three types of incomplete constituents indicates that the interpretation 
of ellipsis and constituent fragments i not a unified process. Each fragment type requires a 
different reconstruction procedure which operates at a distinct level of representation.
