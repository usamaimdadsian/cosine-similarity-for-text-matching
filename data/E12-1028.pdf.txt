Abstract
In this paper, we define a new type of
summary for sentiment analysis: a single-
sentence summary that consists of a sup-
porting sentence that conveys the overall
sentiment of a review as well as a convinc-
ing reason for this sentiment. We present a
system for extracting supporting sentences
from online product reviews, based on a
simple and unsupervised method. We de-
sign a novel comparative evaluation method
for summarization, using a crowdsourcing
service. The evaluation shows that our
sentence extraction method performs better
than a baseline of taking the sentence with
the strongest sentiment.
1 Introduction
Given the success of work on sentiment analy-
sis in NLP, increasing attention is being focused
on how to present the results of sentiment analy-
sis to the user. In this paper, we address an im-
portant use case that has so far been neglected:
quick scanning of short summaries of a body of
reviews with the purpose of finding a subset of
reviews that can be studied in more detail. This
use case occurs in companies that want to quickly
assess, perhaps on a daily basis, what consumers
think about a particular product. One-sentence
summaries can be quickly scanned – similar to
the summaries that search engines give for search
results – and the reviews that contain interesting
and new information can then be easily identified.
Consumers who want to quickly scan review sum-
maries to pick out a few reviews that are helpful
for a purchasing decision are a similar use case.
For a one-sentence summary to be useful in this
context, it must satisfy two different “information
needs”: it must convey the sentiment of the re-
view, but it must also provide a specific reason
for that sentiment, so that the user can make an
informed decision as to whether reading the en-
tire review is likely to be worth the user’s time –
again similar to the purpose of the summary of a
web page in search engine results.
We call a sentence that satisfies these two crite-
ria a supporting sentence. A supporting sentence
contains information on the sentiment as well as
a specific reason for why the author arrived at this
sentiment. Examples for supporting sentences are
“The picture quality is very good” or “The bat-
tery life is 2 hours”. Non-supporting sentences
contain opinions without such reasons such as “I
like the camera” or “This camera is not worth the
money”.
To address use cases of sentiment analysis that
involve quick scanning and selective reading of
large numbers of reviews, we present a simple un-
supervised system in this paper that extracts one
supporting sentence per document and show that
it is superior to a baseline of selecting the sentence
with the strongest sentiment.
One problem we faced in our experiments was
that standard evaluations of summarization would
have been expensive to conduct for this study. We
therefore used crowdsourcing to perform a new
type of comparative evaluation method that is dif-
ferent from training set and gold standard cre-
ation, the dominant way crowdsourcing has been
used in NLP so far.
In summary, our contributions in this paper are
as follows. We define supporting sentences, a new
type of sentiment summary that is appropriate in
situations where both the sentiment of a review
and a good reason for that sentiment need to be
276
conveyed succinctly. We present a simple un-
supervised method for extracting supporting sen-
tences and show that it is superior to a baseline in
a novel crowdsourcing-based evaluation.
In the next section, we describe related work
that is relevant to our new approach. In Section 3
we present the approach we use to identify sup-
porting sentences. Section 4 describes the fea-
ture representation of sentences and the classifi-
cation method. In Section 5 we give an overview
of the crowdsourcing evaluation. Section 6 dis-
cusses our experimental results. In Sections 7 and
8, we present our conclusions and plans for future
work.
2 Related Work
Both sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008;
Liu, 2010) and summarization (Nenkova and
McKeown, 2011) are important subfields of NLP.
The work most relevant to this paper is work on
summarization methods that addresses the spe-
cific requirements of summarization in sentiment
analysis. There are two lines of work in this vein
with goals similar to ours: (i) aspect-based and
pro/con-summarization and (ii) approaches that
extract summary sentences from reviews.
An aspect is a component or attribute of a
product such as “battery”, “lens cap”, “battery
life”, and “picture quality” for cameras. Aspect-
oriented summarization (Hu and Liu, 2004;
Zhuang et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006) col-
lects sentiment assessments for a given set of as-
pects and returns a list of pros and cons about ev-
ery aspect for a review or, in some cases, on a
per-sentence basis.
Aspect-oriented summarization and pro/con-
summarization differ in a number of ways from
supporting sentence summarization. First, as-
pects and pros&cons are taken from a fixed in-
ventory. The inventory is typically small and does
not cover the full spectrum of relevant informa-
tion. Second, in its most useful form, aspect-
oriented summarization requires classification of
phrases and sentences according to the aspect they
belong to; e.g., “The camera is very light” has
to be recognized as being relevant to the aspect
“weight”. Developing a component that assigns
phrases and sentences to their corresponding cat-
egories is time-consuming and has to be redone
for each domain. Any such component will make
mistakes and undetected or incorrectly classified
aspects can result in bad summaries.
Our approach enables us to find strong support-
ing sentences even if the reason given in that sen-
tence does not fit well into the fixed inventory. No
manual work like the creation of an aspect inven-
tory is necessary and there are no requirements on
the format of the reviews such as author-provided
pros and cons.
Aspect-oriented summarization also differs in
that it does not differentiate along the dimension
of quality of the reason given for a sentiment. For
example, “I don’t like the zoom” and “The zoom
range is too limited” both give reasons for why a
camera gets a negative evaluation, but only the lat-
ter reason is informative. In our work, we evaluate
the quality of the reason given for a sentiment.
The use case we address in this paper requires
a short, easy-to-read summary. A well-formed
sentence is usually easier to understand than a
pro/con table. It also has the advantage that the
information conveyed is accurately representing
what the user wanted to say – this is not the case
for a presentation that involves several complex
processing steps and takes linguistic material out
of the context that may be needed to understand it
correctly.
Berend (2011) performs a form of pro/con
summarization that does not rely on aspects.
However, most of the problems of aspect-based
pro/con summarization also apply to this paper:
no differentiation between good and bad reasons,
the need for human labels to train a classifier, and
inferior readability compared to a well-formed
sentence.
Two previous approaches that have attempted
to extract sentences from reviews in the context
of summarization are (Beineke et al., 2004) and
(Arora et al., 2009). Beineke et al. (2004) train
a classifier on rottentomatoes.com summary sen-
tences provided by review authors. These sen-
tences sometimes contain a specific reason for the
overall sentiment of the review, but sometimes
they are just catchy lines whose purpose is to
draw moviegoers in to read the entire review; e.g.,
“El Bulli barely registers a pulse stronger than a
book’s” (which does not give a specific reason for
why the movie does not register a strong pulse).
Arora et al. (2009) define two classes of sen-
tences: qualified claims and bald claims. A qual-
ified claim gives the reader more details (e.g.,
“This camera is small enough to fit easily in a
277
coat pocket”) while a bald claim is open to inter-
pretation (e.g., “This camera is small”). Quali-
fied/bald is a dimension of classification of senti-
ment statements that is to some extent orthogonal
to quality of reason. Qualified claims do not have
to contain a reason and bald claims can contain
an informative reason. For example, “I didn’t like
the camera, but I suspect it will be a great camera
for first timers” is classified as a qualified claim,
but the sentence does not give a good reason for
the sentiment of the document. Both dimensions
(qualified/bald, high-quality/low-quality reason)
are important and can be valuable components of
a complete sentiment analysis system.
Apart from the definition of the concept of sup-
porting sentence, which we believe to be more ap-
propriate for the application we have in mind than
rottentomatoes.com summary sentences and qual-
ified claims, there are two other important differ-
ences of our approach to these two papers. First,
we directly evaluate the quality of the reasons in a
crowdsourcing experiment. Second, our approach
is unsupervised and does not require manual an-
notation of a training set of supporting sentences.
As we will discuss in Section 5, we propose
a novel evaluation measure for summarization
based on crowdsourcing in this paper. The most
common use of crowdsourcing in NLP is to have
workers label a training set and then train a super-
vised classifier on this training set. In contrast, we
use crowdsourcing to directly evaluate the relative
quality of the automatic summaries generated by
the unsupervised method we propose.
3 Approach
Our approach is based on the following three
premises.
(i) A good supporting sentence conveys both
the review’s sentiment and a supporting fact.
We make this assumption because we want
the sentence to be self-contained. If it only
describes a fact about a product without
evaluation, then it does not on its own ex-
plain which sentiment is conveyed by the ar-
ticle and why.
(ii) Supporting facts are most often expressed by
noun phrases. We call a noun phrase that ex-
presses a supporting fact a keyphrase. We
are not assuming that all important words
in the supporting sentence are nominal; the
verb will be needed in many cases to accu-
rately convey the reason for the sentiment
expressed. However, it is a fairly safe as-
sumption that part of the information is con-
veyed using noun phrases since it is dif-
ficult to convey specific information with-
out using specific noun phrases. Adjectives
are often important when expressing a rea-
son, but frequently a noun is also mentioned
or one would need to resolve a pronoun to
make the sentence a self-contained support-
ing sentence. In a sentence like “It’s easy
to use” it is not clear what the adjective is
referring to.
(iii) Noun phrases that express supporting facts
tend to be domain-specific; they can be
automatically identified by selecting noun
phrases that are frequent in the domain – ei-
ther in relative terms (compared to a generic
corpus) or in absolute terms. By making
this assumption we may fail to detect sup-
porting sentences that are worded in an orig-
inal way using ordinary words. However,
in a specific domain there is usually a lot
of redundancy and most good reasons oc-
cur many times and are expressed by similar
words.
Based on these assumptions, we select the sup-
porting sentence in two steps. In the first step, we
determine the n sentences with the strongest sen-
timent within every review by classifying the po-
larity of the sentences (where n is a parameter).
In the second step, we select one of the n sen-
tences as the best supporting sentence by means
of a weighting function.
Step 1: Sentiment Classification
In this step, we apply a sentiment classifier to all
sentences of the review to classify sentences as
positive or negative. We then select the n sen-
tences with the highest probability of conforming
with the overall sentiment of the document. For
example, if the document’s polarity is negative,
we select the n sentences that are most likely to be
negative according to the sentiment classifier. We
restrict the set of n sentences to sentences with the
“right” sentiment because even an excellent sup-
porting sentence is not a good characterization of
278
the content of the review if it contradicts the over-
all assessment given by the review. Only in cases
where there are fewer than n sentences with the
correct sentiment, we also select sentences with
the “wrong” sentence to obtain a minimum of n
sentences for each review.
Step 2: Weighting Function
Based on premises (ii) and (iii) above, we score
a sentence based on the number of noun phrases
that occur with high absolute and relative fre-
quency in the domain. We only consider sim-
ple nouns and compound nouns consisting of
two nouns in this paper. In general, compound
nouns are more informative and specific. A com-
pound noun may refer to a specific reason even
if the head noun does not (e.g., “life” vs. “battery
life”). This means that we need to compute scores
in a way that allows us to give higher weight to
compound nouns than to simple nouns.
In addition, we also include counts of nouns
and compounds in the scoring that do not have
high absolute/relative frequency because fre-
quency heuristics identify keyphrases with only
moderate accuracy. However, theses nouns and
compounds are given a lower weight.
This motivates a scoring function that is a
weighted sum of four variables: number of simple
nouns with high frequency, number of infrequent
simple nouns, number of compound nouns with
high frequency, and number of infrequent com-
pound nouns. High frequency is defined as fol-
lows. Let fdom(p) be the domain-specific abso-
lute frequency of phrase p, i.e., the frequency in
the review corpus, and fwiki(p) the frequency of
p in the English Wikipedia. We view the distribu-
tion of terms in Wikipedia as domain-independent
and define the relative frequency as in Equation 1.
frel(p) =
fdom(p)
fwiki(p)
(1)
We do not consider nouns and compound nouns
that do not occur in Wikipedia for computing
the relative frequency. A noun (resp. compound
noun) is deemed to be of high frequency if it is
one of the k% nouns (resp. compound nouns) with
the highest fdom(p) and at the same time is one of
the k% nouns (resp. compound nouns) with the
highest frel(p) where k is a parameter.
Based on these definitions, we define four dif-
ferent sets: F1 (the set of nouns with high fre-
quency), I1 (the set of infrequent nouns), F2 (the
set of compounds with high frequency), and I2
(the set of infrequent compounds). An infrequent
noun (resp. compound) is simply defined as a
noun (resp. compound) that does not meet the fre-
quency criterion.
We define the score s of a sentence with n to-
kens t1 . . . tn (where the last token tn is a punctu-
ation mark) as follows:
s =
n?1?
i=1
wf2 · [[(ti, ti+1) ? F2]]
+ wi2 · [[(ti, ti+1) ? I2]]
+ wf1 · [[ti ? F1]]
+ wi1 · [[ti ? I1]]
(2)
where [[?]] = 1 if ? is true and [[?]] = 0 otherwise.
Note that a noun in a compound will contribute to
the overall score in two different summands.
The weights wf2 , wi2 , wf1 , and wi1 are deter-
mined using logistic regression. The training set
for the regression is created in an unsupervised
fashion as follows. From each set of n sentences
(one per review), we select the two highest scor-
ing, i.e., the two sentences that were classified
with the highest confidence. The two classes in
the regression problem are then the top ranked
sentences vs. the sentences at rank 2. Since tak-
ing all sentences turned out to be too noisy, we
eliminate sentence pairs where the top sentence is
better than the second sentence on almost all of
the set counts (i.e., count of members of F1, I1,
F2, and I2). Our hypothesis in setting up this re-
gression was that the sentence with the strongest
sentiment often does not give a good reason. Our
experiments confirm that this hypothesis is true.
The weights wf2 , wi2 , wf1 , and wi1 estimated
by the regression are then used to score sentences
according to Equation 2.
We give the same weight to all keyphrase com-
pounds (and the same weight to all keyphrase
nouns) – in future work one could attempt to give
higher weights to keyphrases with higher absolute
or relative frequency. In this paper, our goal is to
establish a simple baseline for the task of extrac-
tion of supporting sentences.
After computing the overall weight for each
sentence in a review, the sentence with the highest
weight is chosen as the supporting sentence – the
sentence that is most informative for explaining
the overall sentiment of the review.

4 Experiments
4.1 Data
We use part of the Amazon dataset from Jindal
and Liu (2008). The dataset consists of more than
5.8 million consumer-written reviews of several
products, taken from the Amazon website. For
our experiment we used the digital camera do-
main and extracted 15,340 reviews covering a to-
tal of 740 products. See table 1 for key statistics
of the data set.
Type Number
Brands 17
Products 740
Documents (all) 15,340
Documents (cleaned) 11,624
Documents (train) 9,880
Documents (test) 1,744
Short test documents 147
Long test documents 1,597
Average number of sents 13.36
Median number of sents 10
Table 1: Key statistics of our dataset
In addition to the review text, authors can give
an overall rating (a number of stars) to the prod-
uct. Possible ratings are 5 (very positive), 4 (pos-
itive), 3 (neutral), 2 (negative), and 1 (very nega-
tive). We unify ratings of 4 and 5 to “positive” and
ratings of 1 and 2 to “negative” to obtain polarity
labels for binary classification. Reviews with a
rating of 3 are discarded.
4.2 Preprocessing
We tokenized and part-of-speech (POS) tagged
the corpus using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). We
split each review into individual sentences by us-
ing the sentence boundaries given by TreeTag-
ger. One problem with user-written reviews is
that they are often not written in coherent En-
glish, which results in wrong POS tags. To ad-
dress some of these problems, we cleaned the
corpus after the tokenization step. We separated
word-punctuation clusters (e.g., word...word) and
removed emoticons, html tags, and all sentences
with three or fewer tokens, many of which were
a result of wrong tokenization. We excluded all
reviews with fewer than five sentences. Short re-
views are often low-quality and do not give good
reasons. The cleaned corpus consists of 11,624
documents. Finally, we split the corpus into train-
ing set (85%) and test set (15%) as shown in Table
1. The average number of sentences of a review is
13.36 sentences, the median number of sentences
is 10.
4.3 Sentiment Classification
We first build a sentence sentiment classifier by
training the Stanford maximum entropy classifier
(Manning and Klein, 2003) on the sentences in the
training set. Sentences occurring in positive (resp.
negative) reviews are labeled positive (resp. neg-
ative). We use a simple bag-of-words representa-
tion (without punctuation characters and frequent
stop words). Propagating labels from documents
to sentences creates a noisy training set because
some sentences have sentiment different from the
sentiment in their documents; however, there is
no alternative because we need per-sentence clas-
sification decisions, but do not have per-sentence
human labels.
The accuracy of the classifier is 88.4% on
“propagated” sentence labels.
We use the sentence classifier in two ways.
First, it defines our baseline BL for extracting
supporting sentences: the baseline simply pro-
poses the sentence with the highest sentiment
score that is compatible with the sentiment of the
document as the supporting sentence.
Second, the sentence classifier selects a subset
of candidate sentences that is then further pro-
cessed using the scoring function in Equation 2.
This subset consists of the n = 5 sentences with
the highest sentiment scores of the “right” polarity
– that is, if the document is positive (resp. nega-
tive), then the n = 5 sentences with the highest
positive (resp. negative) scores are selected.
4.4 Determining Frequencies and Weights
The absolute frequency of nouns and compound
nouns simply is computed as their token fre-
quency in the training set. For computing the rel-
ative frequency (as described in Section 3, Equa-
tion 1), we use the 20110405 dump of the English
Wikipedia.
In the product review corpora we studied,
the percentage of high-frequency keyphrase com-
pound nouns was higher than that of simple
nouns. We therefore use two different thresh-
olds for absolute and relative frequency. We de-
280
fine F1 as the set of nouns that are in the top
kn = 2.5% for both absolute and relative fre-
quencies; and F2 as the set of compounds that are
in the top kp = 5% for both absolute and rela-
tive frequencies. These thresholds are set to ob-
tain a high density of good keyphrases with few
false positives. Below the threshold there are still
other good keyphrases, but they cannot be sepa-
rated easily from non-keyphrases.
Sentences are scored according to Equation 2.
Recall that the parameters wf2 , wi2 , wf1 , and wi1
are determined using logistic regression. The ob-
tained parameter values (see table 2) indicate the
relative importance of the four different types of
terms. Compounds are the most important term
and even those with a frequency below the thresh-
old kp still provide more detailed information than
simple nouns above the threshold kn; the value of
wi2 is approximately twice the value wf1 for this
reason. Non-keyphrase nouns are least important
and are weighted with only a very small value of
wi1 = 0.01.
Phrase Par Value
keyphrase compounds wf2 1.07
non-keyphrase compounds wi2 0.89
keyphrase nouns wf1 0.46
non-keyphrase nouns wi1 0.01
Table 2: Weight settings
The scoring function with these parameter val-
ues is applied to the n = 5 selected sentences of
the review. The highest scoring sentence is then
selected as the supporting sentence proposed by
our system.
For 1380 of the 1744 reviews, the sentence se-
lected by our system is different from the baseline
sentence; however, there are 364 cases (20.9%)
where the two are the same. Only the 1380 cases
where the two methods differ are included in the
crowdsourcing evaluation to be described in the
next section. As we will show below, our sys-
tem selects better supporting sentences than the
baseline in most cases. So if baseline and our sys-
tem agree, then it is even more likely that the sen-
tence selected by both is a good supporting sen-
tence. However, there could also be cases where
the n = 5 sentences selected by the sentiment
classifier are all bad supporting sentences or cases
where the document does not contain any good
supporting sentences.
5 Comparative Evaluation with Amazon
Mechanical Turk
One standard way to evaluate summarization sys-
tems is to create hand-edited summaries and to
compute some measure of similarity (e.g., word
or n-gram overlap) between automatic and human
summaries. An alternative for extractive sum-
maries is to classify all sentences in the document
with respect to their appropriateness as summary
sentences. An automatic summary can then be
scored based on its ability to correctly identify
good summary sentences. Both of these meth-
ods require a large annotation effort and are most
likely too complex to be outsourced to a crowd-
sourcing service because the creation of manual
summaries requires skilled writers. For the sec-
ond type of evaluation, ranking sentences accord-
ing to a criterion is a lot more time consuming
than making a binary decision – so ranking the
13 or 14 sentences that a review contains on av-
erage for the entire test set would be a signifi-
cant annotation effort. It would also be difficult
to obtain consistent and repeatable annotation in
crowdsourcing on this task due to its subtlety.
We therefore designed a novel evaluation
methodology in this paper that has a much smaller
startup cost. It is well known that relative judg-
ments are easier to make on difficult tasks than ab-
solute judgments. For example, much recent work
on relevance ranking in information retrieval re-
lies on relative relevance judgments (one docu-
ment is more relevant than another) rather than ab-
solute relevance judgments. We adopt this gen-
eral idea and only request such relative judgments
on supporting sentences from annotators. Unlike
a complete ranking of the sentences (which would
require m(m ? 1)/2 judgments where m is the
length of the review), we choose a setup where
we need to only elicit a single relative judgment
per review, one relative judgment on a sentence
pair (consisting of the baseline sentence and the
system sentence) for each of the 1380 reviews se-
lected in the previous section. This is a manage-
able annotation task that can be run on a crowd-
sourcing service in a short time and at little cost.
We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) for
this annotation task. The main advantage of AMT
is that cost per annotation task is very low, so that
we can obtain large annotated datasets for an af-
281

fordable price. The disadvantage is the level of
quality of the annotation which will be discussed
at the end of this section.
5.1 Task Design
We created a HIT (Human Intelligence Task)
template including detailed annotation guidelines.
Every HIT consists of a pair of sentences. One
sentence is the baseline sentence; the other sen-
tence is the system sentence, i.e., the sentence se-
lected by the scoring function. The two sentences
are presented in random order to avoid bias.
The workers are then asked to evaluate the rel-
ative quality of the sentences by selecting one of
the following three options:
1. Sentence 1 has the more convincing reason
2. Sentence 2 has the more convincing reason
3. Neither sentence has a convincing reason
If both sentences contain reasons, the worker
has to compare the two reasons and choose the
sentence with the more convincing reason.
Each HIT was posted to three different workers
to make it possible to assess annotator agreement.
Every worker can process each HIT only once
so that the three assignments are always done by
three different people.
Based on the worker annotations, we compute a
gold standard score for each sentence. This score
is simply the number of times it was rated bet-
ter than its competitor. The score can be 0, 1, 2
or 3. HITs for which the worker chooses the op-
tion “Neither sentence has a convincing reason”
are ignored when computing sentence scores.
The sentence with the higher score is then se-
lected as the best supporting sentence for the cor-
responding review.
In cases of ties, we posted the sentence pair one
more time for one worker. If one of the two sen-
tences has a higher score after this reposting, we
choose it as the winner. Otherwise we label this
sentence pair “no decision” or “N-D”.
5.2 Quality of AMT Annotations
Since our crowdsourcing based evaluation is
novel, it is important to investigate if human an-
notators perform the annotation consistently and
reproducibly.
The Fleiss’ ? agreement score for the final
experiment is 0.17. AMT workers only have
the instructions given by the requesters. If they
are not clear enough or too complicated, work-
ers can misunderstand the task, which decreases
the quality of the answers. There are also AMT
workers who spam and give random answers to
tasks. Moreover, ranking sentences according to
the quality of the given reason is a subjective task.
Even if the sentence contains a reason, it might
not be convincing for the worker.
To ensure a high level of quality for our dataset,

sentence blue. The worker had to type the word
of their preferred sentence into the corresponding
answer field or NOTCONV into the special field if
neither sentence was convincing. Figure 1 shows
our AMT interface design.
For each answer field we have a gold stan-
dard (the words we marked blue and the word
NOTCONV) which enables us to look for spam.
The analysis showed that some workers mistyped
some words, which however only indicates that
the worker actually typed the word instead of
copying it from the task. Some workers submit-
ted inconsistent answers, for instance, they typed
a random word or filled out all three answer fields.
In such cases we reposted this HIT again to re-
ceive a correct answer.
After the task, we counted how often a worker
said that neither sentence is convincing since a
high number indicates that the worker might have
only copied the word for several sentence pairs
without checking the content of the sentences. We
also analyzed the time a worker needed for every
HIT. Since no task was done in less than 10 sec-
onds, the possibility of just copying the word was
rather low.
6 Results and discussion
The results of the AMT experiment are shown in
table 3. As described above, each of the 1380
sentence pairs was evaluated by three workers.
Workers rated the system sentence as better for
57.9% of the reviews, and the baselines sentence
as better for 27.4% of the reviews; for 14.7% of
reviews, the scores of the two sentences were tied
(line 1 of Table 3). The 203 reviews in this cate-
gory were reposted one more time (as described in
Section 5). The responses were almost perfectly
evenly split: about 47% of workers preferred the
baseline system, 46% the system sentence; 7.4%
of the responses were undecided (line 2). Line 3
presents the consolidated results where the 14.7%
ties on line 1 are replaced by the ratings obtained
on line 2 in the second pass.
The consolidated results (line 3) show that our
system is clearly superior to the baseline of se-
lecting the sentence with the strongest sentiment.
Our system selected a better supporting sentence
for 64.6% of the reviews; the baseline selected a
better sentence for 34.3% of the reviews. These
results exclude the reviews where baseline and
system selected the same sentence. If we as-
sume that these sentences are also acceptable sen-
tences (since they score well on the traditional
sentiment metrics as well as on our new con-
tent keyword metric), then our system finds a
good supporting sentence for 72.0% of reviews
(51.1+20.9) whereas the baseline does so for only
48.0% (27.1+20.9).
6.1 Error Analysis
Our error analysis revealed that a significant pro-
portion of system sentences that were worse than
baseline sentences did contain a reason. How-
ever, the baseline sentence also contained a reason
and was rated better by AMT annotators. Exam-
ples (1) and (2) show two such cases. The first
sentence is the baseline sentence (BL) which was
rated better. The system sentence (SY) contains
a similar or different reason. Since rating reasons
is a very subjective task, it is impossible to de-
fine which of these two sentences contains the bet-
ter reason and depends on how the workers think
about it.
(1) BL:The best thing is that everything is just so
easily displayed and one doesn’t need a
manual to start getting the work done.
SY: The zoom is incredible, the video was so
clear that I actually thought of making a
15 min movie.
283
(2) BL:The colors are horrible, indoor shots are
horrible, and too much noise.
SY: Who cares about 8 mega pixels and 1600
iso when it takes such bad quality pic-
tures.
In example (3) the system sentence is an in-
complete sentence consisting of only two noun
phrases. These cut-off sentences are mainly
caused by incorrect usage of grammar and punc-
tuation by the reviewers which results in wrongly
determined sentence boundaries in the prepro-
cessing step.
(3) BL:Gives peace of mind to have it fit per-
fectly.
SY: battery and SD card.
In some cases, the two sentences that were pre-
sented to the worker in the evaluation had a dif-
ferent polarity. This can have two reasons: (i) due
to noisy training input, the classifier misclassified
some of the sentences, and (ii) for short reviews
we also used sentences with the non-conforming
polarity. Sentences with different polarity often
confused the workers and they tended to prefer
the positive sentence even if the negative one con-
tained a more convincing reason as can be seen in
example (4).
(4) BL:It shares same basic commands and
setup, so the learning curve was minimal.
SY: I was not blown away by the image qual-
ity, and as others have mentioned, the
flash really is weak.
A general problem with our approach is that the
weighting function favors sentences with many
noun phrases. The system sentence in example
(5) contains many noun phrases, including some
highly frequent nouns (e.g., ”lens”, ”battery”),
but there is no convincing reason and the baseline
sentence has been selected by the workers.
(5) BL:I have owned my cd300 for about 3 weeks
and have already taken 700 plus pictures.
SY: It has something to do with the lens be-
cause the manual says it only happens to
the 300 and when I called Sony tech sup-
port the guy tried to tell me the battery
was faulty and it wasn’t.
Finally, there are a number of cases where our
assumption that good supporting sentences con-
tain keyphrases is incorrect. For example, sen-
tence (6) does not contain any keyphrases indica-
tive of good reasons. The information that makes
it a good supporting sentence is mainly expressed
using verbs and particles.
(6) I have had an occasional problem with
the camera not booting up and telling me
to turn it off and then on again.
7 Conclusion
In this work, we presented a system that ex-
tracts supporting sentences, single-sentence sum-
maries of a document that contain a convincing
reason for the author’s opinion about a product.
We used an unsupervised approach that extracts
keyphrases of the given domain and then weights
these keyphrases to identify supporting sentences.
We used a novel comparative evaluation method-
ology with the crowdsourcing framework Ama-
zon Mechanical Turk to evaluate this novel task
since no gold standard is available. We showed
that our keyphrase-based system performs better
than a baseline of extracting the sentence with the
highest sentiment score.
8 Future work
Our method failed for some of the about 35% of
reviews where it did not find a convincing reason
because of the noisiness of reviews. Reviews are
user-generated content and contain grammatically
incorrect sentences and are full of typographical
errors. This problem makes it hard to perform pre-
processing steps like part-of-speech tagging and
sentence boundary detection correctly and reli-
ably. We plan to address these problems in fu-
ture work by developing a more robust processing
pipeline.
