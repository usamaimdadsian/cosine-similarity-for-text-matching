Abstract
We present a multilingual corpus of
Wikipedia and Twitter texts annotated
with FRAMENET 1.5 semantic frames in
nine different languages, as well as a
novel technique for weakly supervised
cross-lingual frame-semantic parsing. Our
approach only assumes the existence of
linked, comparable source and target lan-
guage corpora (e.g., Wikipedia) and a
bilingual dictionary (e.g., Wiktionary or
BABELNET). Our approach uses a truly
interlingual representation, enabling us to
use the same model across all nine lan-
guages. We present average error reduc-
tions over running a state-of-the-art parser
on word-to-word translations of 46% for
target identification, 37% for frame identi-
fication, and 14% for argument identifica-
tion.
1 Introduction
Frame-semantic parsing is the task of automati-
cally finding semantically salient targets in text,
disambiguating the targets by assigning a sense
(frame) to them, identifying their arguments, and
labeling these arguments with appropriate roles.
The FRAMENET 1.5 lexicon
1
provides a fixed
repository of semantic frames and roles, which we
use in the experiments below.
Several learning and parsing algorithms have
been developed for frame-semantic analysis (Jo-
hansson and Nugues, 2007; Das et al., 2014; Täck-
ström et al., 2015), and frame semantics has been
successfully applied to question-answering (Shen
and Lapata, 2007), information extraction (Sur-
deanu et al., 2003) and knowledge extraction (Sø-
gaard et al., 2015b).

In contrast to Propbank-style semantic-role la-
beling (Titov and Klementiev, 2012), only very
limited frame-semantic resources exist for lan-
guages other than English. We therefore fo-
cus on multilingual or cross-language frame-
semantic parsing, leveraging resources for English
and other major languages to build any-language
parsers. We stress that we learn frame-semantic
parsing models that can be applied to any lan-
guage, rather than cross-lingual transfer models
for specific target languages. Our approach re-
lies on inter-lingual word embeddings (Søgaard
et al., 2015a), which are built from topic-aligned
documents. Word embeddings have previously
been used for monolingual frame-semantic pars-
ing by Hermann et al. (2014).
Contributions This paper makes the following
three contributions. We present a new multi-
lingual frame-annotated corpus covering five top-
ics, two domains (Wikipedia and Twitter), and
nine languages. We implement a simplified ver-
sion of the frame-semantic parser introduced in
Das et al. (2014). Finally, we show how to modify
this parser to learn any-language frame-semantic
parsing models using inter-lingual word embed-
dings (Søgaard et al., 2015a).
2 Data annotation
Figure 1 depicts a FRAMENET 1.5 frame-semantic
analysis of a German sentence from Wikipedia.
The annotator marked two words, Idee and kam,
as targets. In frame-semantic parsing, target iden-
tification is the task of deciding which words (i.e.
targets) trigger FRAMENET frames. Frame iden-
tification is the problem of disambiguating targets
by labeling them with frames, e.g., COGITATION
or COMING_UP_WITH. Argument identification
is the problem of identifying the arguments of
frames, e.g., Idee for COMING_UP_WITH.
We had linguistically trained students anno-
2062
Figure 1: Frame semantic annotation from the German Wikipedia data (Women’s Rights)
tate about 200 sentences from Wikipedia and 200
tweets each in their native language. The data
was pre-annotated by obtaining all English trans-
lation equivalents of the source language words
through BABELNET
2
, finding associated frames
in the FRAMENET 1.5 training data. We pre-
sented annotators with all frames that could be
triggered by any of the target word’s transla-
tions. Both data from Wikipedia and Twit-
ter cover the same five topics: Google, An-
gelina Jolie, Harry Potter, Women’s Rights, and
Christiano Ronaldo. The topics were chosen
to guarantee coverage for all nine languages,
both in Wikipedia and Twitter. Our corpus,
which covers nine languages, is publicly avail-
able at https://github.com/andersjo/
any-language-frames The languages we
cover are Bulgarian (BG), Danish (DA), German
(DE), Greek (EL), English (EN), Spanish (ES),
French (FR), Italian (IT) and Swedish (SV). En-
glish is included as a sanity check of our cross-
lingual annotation setup.
The English, Danish, and Spanish datasets
were doubly-annotated in order to compute inter-
annotator agreement (IAA). The overall target
identification IAA was 82.4% F
1
for English,
81.6% for Danish, and 80.0% for Spanish. This
is lower than a similar monolingual annotation
experiment recently reporting target identification
IAA at 95.3% (Søgaard et al., 2015b). The frame
identification IAA scores were also higher in that
study, at 84.5% and 78.1% F
1
. The drop in
agreement seems mostly due to pre-tagging er-
rors caused by erroneous or irrelevant word-to-
word translations. The Spanish data has the lowest
agreement score.
We compute test-retest reliability of our anno-
tations as the correlation coefficient (Pearson’s ?)
between the two annotations. In Cronbach’s ? in-
ternal consistency table, the cut-off for acceptable
reliability is 0.7. While there is certainly noise in
our annotations, these are still consistently above

els across 18 datasets, covering nine different lan-
guages with two domains each; although for read-
ability, we combine the Wiktionary and Twitter
datasets for each language below.
The relatively low reliability compared to pre-
vious annotation efforts is due to the cross-lingual
pre-annotation step, which was necessary to make
annotation feasible. All languages, including En-
glish, have been pre-annotated using BABELNET.
We expect annotators to only assign frames when
meaningful frames can be assigned, so the main
source of error is that the pre-annotation may ex-
clude valid frames. Hence, we will not only re-
port F
1
-scores in our evaluations, but also preci-
sion, since recall may be misleading, penalizing
for frames that could not be chosen by the annota-
tors.
3 Frame semantic parsing
3.1 Target identification
Following Das et al. (2014), we use part-of-speech
heuristics to identify the words that evoke frames
(target words). Frame-evoking words typically be-
long to a narrow range of part of speech. There-
fore, we only consider words as target candidates
2063
when tagged with one of the top k part-of-speech
tags most commonly seen as targets in the train-
ing set. The k parameter is optimized to maxi-
mize F
1
on our development language, Spanish,
where we found k = 7.
3
Surviving candidates are
then translated into English by mapping the words
into multi-lingual BABELNET synsets, which rep-
resent sets of words with similar meaning across
languages. All English words in the BABEL-
NET synsets are considered possible translations.
If any of the translations are potential targets in
FRAMENET 1.5, the current word is identified as
a frame-evoking word.
3.2 Frame identification
A target word is, on average, ambiguous be-
tween three frames. We use a multinomial log-
linear classifier
4
(with default parameters) to de-
cide which of the possible frames evoked by the
target word that fits the context best. Our feature
representation replicates that of Das et al. (2014)
as far as possible, considering the multilingual set-
ting where lexical features cannot be directly used.
To compensate for the lack of lexical features,
we introduce two groups of language-independent
features that rely on multilingual word embed-
dings. One feature group uses the embedding of
the target word directly, while the other is based on
distance measures between the target word and the
set of English words used as targets for a possible
frame. We measure the minimum and mean dis-
tance (in embedding space) from the target word
to the set of English target words, as well as the
distances to each word individually.
Several of the features in the original repre-
sentation are built on top of automatic POS an-
notation and syntactic parses. We use the Uni-
versal Dependencies v1.1 treebanks for the lan-
guages in our data to train part-of-speech taggers
(TREETAGGER
5
) and a dependency parser (TUR-
BOPARSER
6
) to generate the syntactic features. In
contrast to Das et al. (2014), we use dependency
subtrees instead of spans.
3
The white-listed POS are nouns, verbs, adjectives,
proper nouns, adverbs, and determiners.

3.3 Argument identification
A frame contains a number of named arguments
that may or may not be expressed in a given sen-
tence. Argument identification is concerned with
assigning frame arguments to spans of words in
the sentence. While this task can benefit from in-
formation on the joint assignment of arguments,
Das et al. (2014) report only an improvement of
less than 1% in F
1
using beam search to approxi-
mate a global optimal configuration for argument
identification. To simplify our system, we take all
argument-identification decisions independently.
We use a single classifier for argument identifica-
tion, computing the most probable argument for
each frame element. Each word index is associ-
ated with a span by the transitive closure of its syn-
tactic dependencies (i.e. subtree). Our greedy ap-
proach to argument identification thus amounts to
scoring the n+ 1 possible realisations of an argu-
ment for an n-length sentence (i.e. subtrees plus
the empty argument), selecting the highest scor-
ing subtree for each argument type allowed by the
frame.
As the training data contains very few examples
of each frame or role (e.g., Buyer in the frame
COMMERCE_SCENARIO), we enable sharing of
features for frame arguments that have the same
name. The assumption is that arguments with
identical names have similar semantic properties
across frames; that is the argument Perpetrator,
for example, is similar for the frames ARSON and
THEFT.
The scores are the confidences of a binary clas-
sifier trained on <frame, argument, subtree> tu-
ples. Positive examples are the observed argu-
ments. We use the remaining n incorrect subtrees
for a given <frame, argument> pair to generate
negative training examples . A single binary clas-
sification model is trained for the whole data set.
As with frame identification, our features are
similar to those of Das et al. (2014), with a few
exceptions and additions. We use dependency sub-
trees instead of spans and replace all lexical fea-
tures (which do not transfer cross-lingually) with
features based on the interlingual word embed-
dings from Søgaard et al. (2015a). We use the
embeddings to find the 20 most similar words in
the training data and use these words to generate
lexical features that matched the source-language
training data. Each feature is weighted by its co-
sine similarity with the target-language word.

Table 2: Frame semantic parsing results (precision and F
1
in %)
Baseline Our approach to multi-lingual frame
semantics parsing extends Das et al. (2014) to
cross-lingual learning using the interlingual em-
beddings from Søgaard et al. (2015a). Our base-
line is a more direct application of the SEMAFOR
system
7
(Das et al., 2014), translating target lan-
guage text to English using word-to-word transla-
tions and projecting annotation back. For word-
to-word translation we use Wiktionary bilingual
dictionaries (Ács, 2014), and we use frequency
counts from UKWAC
8
to disambiguate words with
multiple translations, preferring the most common
one. The baseline and our system both use the
training data supplied with FRAMENET for learn-
ing.
4 Results
Consider first the target identification results in
Table 2. We observe that using BABELNET and
our re-implementation of Das et al. (2014) per-
forms considerably better than running SEMAFOR
on Wiktionary word-by-word translations.
Our frame identification results are also pre-
7
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/SEMAFOR/
8
http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/
sented in Table 2. Our system is better in six out of
nine cases, whereas the most frequent sense base-
line is best in two. It is unsurprising that English
fares best in this setup, because it does not undergo
the word-to-word translation of the other data sets.
Argument identification is a harder task, and
scores are generally lower; see the lower part of
Table 2. Also, note that errors percolate: If we do
not identify a target, or mislabel a frame, we can
no longer retrieve the correct arguments. Never-
theless, we observe that we are better than running
SEMAFOR on word-by-word translations in eight
out of nine languages—all, except English.
Generally, we obtain error reductions over our
baseline of 46% for target identification, 37% for
frame identification, and 14% for argument iden-
tification. For English, we are only 2% (absolute)
below IAA for target identification, but about 40%
below IAA for frame and argument identification.
For Danish, the gap is smaller.
If we compare performance on Wikipedia and
Twitter datasets, we see that target identifica-
tion and frame identification scores are gener-
ally higher for Wikipedia, while argument iden-
tification scores are higher for Twitter. While
Wikipedia is generally more similar to the
2065
newswire/balanced corpus in FRAMENET 1.5, the
sentence length is shorter in tweets, making it eas-
ier to identify the correct arguments.
5 Conclusions
We presented a multi-lingual frame-annotated cor-
pus covering nine languages in two domains.
With this corpus we performed experiments to
predict target, frame and argument identification,
outperforming a word-to-word translated baseline
running on SEMAFOR. Our approach is a de-
lexicalized version of Das et al. (2014) with a sim-
pler decoding strategy and, crucially, using multi-
lingual word embeddings to achieve any-language
frame-semantic parsing. Over a baseline of using
SEMAFOR with word-to-word translations, we ob-
tain error reductions of 46% for target identifica-
tion, 37% for frame identification, and 14% for ar-
gument identification.
