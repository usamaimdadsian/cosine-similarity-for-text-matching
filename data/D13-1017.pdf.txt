Abstract
Two recent measures incorporate the notion of
statistical significance in basic PMI formula-
tion. In some tasks, we find that the new mea-
sures perform worse than the PMI. Our anal-
ysis shows that while the basic ideas in incor-
porating statistical significance in PMI are rea-
sonable, they have been applied slightly inap-
propriately. By fixing this, we get new mea-
sures that improve performance over not just
PMI but on other popular co-occurrence mea-
sures as well. In fact, the revised measures
perform reasonably well compared with more
resource intensive non co-occurrence based
methods also.
1 Introduction
The notion of word association is used in many lan-
guage processing and information retrieval appli-
cations and it is important to have low-cost, high-
quality association measures. Lexical co-occurrence
based word association measures are popular be-
cause they are computationally efficient and they can
be applied to any language easily. One of the most
popular co-occurrence measure is Pointwise Mutual
Information (PMI) (Church and Hanks, 1989).
One of the limitations of PMI is that it only works
with relative probabilities and ignores the absolute
amount of evidence. To overcome this, recently two
new measures have been proposed that incorporate
the notion of statistical significance in basic PMI
formulation. In (Washtell and Markert, 2009), sta-
tistical significance is introduced in PMIsig by mul-
tiplying PMI value with the square root of the ev-
idence. In contrast, in (Damani, 2013), cPMId is
introduced by bounding the probability of observing
a given deviation between a given word pair’s co-
occurrence count and its expected value under a null
model where with each word a global unigram gen-
eration probability is associated. In Table 1, we give
the definitions of PMI, PMIsig, and cPMId.
While these new measures perform better than
PMI on some of the tasks, on many other tasks,
we find that the new measures perform worse than
the PMI. In Table 3, we show how these measures
perform compared to PMI on four different tasks.
We find that PMIsig degrades performance in three
out of these four tasks while cPMId degrades per-
formance in two out of these four tasks. The ex-
perimental details and discussion are given in Sec-
tion 4.2.
Our analysis shows that while the basic ideas in
incorporating statistical significance are reasonable,
they have been applied slightly inappropriately. By
fixing this, we get new measures that improve per-
formance over not just PMI, but also on other pop-
ular co-occurrence measures on most of these tasks.
In fact, the revised measures perform reasonably
well compared with more resource intensive non co-
occurrence based methods also.
2 Adapting PMI for Statistical Significance
In (Washtell and Markert, 2009), it is assumed that
the statistical significance of a word pair association
is proportional to the square root of the evidence.
The question of what constitutes the evidence is an-
swered by taking the lesser of the frequencies of the
two words in the word pair, since at most that many
pairings are possible. Hence the PMI value is multi-

min(f(x), f(y)) to get PMIsig.
In (Damani, 2013), statistical significance is
introduced by bounding the probability of observing
a given number of word-pair occurrences in the
corpus, just by chance, under a null model of inde-
pendent unigram occurrences. For this computation,
one needs to decide what constitutes a random trial
when looking for a word-pair occurrence. Is it the
occurrence of the first word (say x) in the pair, or
the second (say y). In (Damani, 2013), occurrences
of x are arbitrarily chosen to represent the sites of
the random trial. Using Hoeffdings Inequality:
P [f(x, y) ? f(x) ? f(y)/W + f(x) ? t]
? exp(?2 ? f(x) ? t2)
By setting t =
?
ln ?/(?2 ? f(x)), we get ? as an
upper bound on probability of observing more than
f(x)?f(y)/W +f(x)? t bigram occurrences in the
corpus, just by chance. Based on this Corpus Level
Significant PMI(cPMI) is defined as:
cPMI(x, y) = log
f(x, y)
f(x) ? f(y)/W + f(x) ? t
= log
f(x, y)
f(x) ? f(y)/W +
?

In (Damani, 2013), several variants of cPMI are in-
troduced that incorporate different notions of sta-
tistical significance. Of these Corpus Level Signif-
icant PMI based on Document count(cPMId - de-
fined in Table 1) is found to be the best performing,
and hence we consider this variant only in this work.
2.1 Choice of Random Trial
While considering statistical significance, one has
to decide what constitutes a random trial. When
looking for a word-pair (x, y)’s occurrences, y can
potentially occur near each occurrence of x, or x
can potentially occur near each occurrence of y.
Which of these two set of occurrences should be
considered the sites of random trial. We believe
that the occurrences of the more frequent of x and y
should be considered, since near each of these occur-
rences the other word could have occurred. Hence
f(x) and f(y) in cPMI definition should be re-
placed with max(f(x), f(y)) and min(f(x), f(y))
respectively. Similarly, d(x) and d(y) in cPMId for-
mula should be replaced with max(d(x), d(y)) and
min(d(x), d(y)) respectively to give a new measure
Significant PMI based on Document count(sPMId).
Using the same logic,
?
min(f(x), f(y))
in PMIsig formula should be replaced with?
max(f(x), f(y)) to give the formula for a new
measure PMI-significant(PMIs). The definitions of
sPMId and PMIs are also given in Table 1.

There are three main types of word association mea-
sures: Knowledge based, Distributional Similarity
based, and Lexical Co-occurrence based.
Based on Firth’s You shall know a word by the
company it keeps (Firth, 1957), distributional sim-

two words for distributional similarity (Agirre et
al., 2009; Wandmacher et al., 2008; Bollegala et
al., 2007; Chen et al., 2006). They are also used
for modeling the meaning of a phrase or a sen-
tence (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Wartena,
2013; Mitchell, 2011; G. Dinu and Baroni, 2013;
Kartsaklis et al., 2013).
Knowledge-based measures use knowledge-
sources like thesauri, semantic networks, or
taxonomies (Milne and Witten, 2008; Hughes
and Ramage, 2007; Gabrilovich and Markovitch,
2007; Yeh et al., 2009; Strube and Ponzetto, 2006;
Finkelstein et al., 2002; Liberman and Markovitch,
2009).
Co-occurrence based measures (Pecina and
Schlesinger, 2006) simply rely on unigram and bi-
gram frequencies of the words in a pair. In this work,
our focus is on the co-occurrence based measures,
since they are resource-light and can easily be used
for resource-scarce languages.
3.1 Co-occurrence Measures being Compared
Co-occurrence based measures of association be-
tween two entities are used in several domains like
ecology, psychology, medicine, language process-
ing, etc. To compare the performance of our newly
introduced measures with other co-occurrence mea-
sures, we have selected a number of popu-
lar co-occurrence measures like ChiSquare (?2),
Dice (Dice, 1945), GoogleDistance (L.Cilibrasi and
Vitany, 2007), Jaccard (Jaccard, 1912), LLR (Dun-
ning, 1993), Simpson (Simpson, 1943), and T-test
from these domains.
In addition to these popular measures, we
also experiment with other known variations of
PMI like nPMI (Bouma, 2009), PMI2 (Daille,
1994), Ochiai (Janson and Vegelius, 1981), and
SCI (Washtell and Markert, 2009). Since PMI2 is
a monotonic transformation of Ochiai, we present
their results together. In Table 2, we present the def-
initions of these measures. While the motivation
given for SCI in (Washtell and Markert, 2009) is
slightly different, in light of the discussion in Sec-
tion 2.1, we can assume that SCI is PMI adapted for
statistical significance (multiplied by
?
f(y)), where
the site of random trial is taken to be the occurrences
of the second word y, instead of the less frequent
word, as in the case of PMIsig.
When counting co-occurrences, we only con-
sider the non-overlapping span-constrained occur-
rences. The span of a word-pair’s occurrence is the
direction-independent distance between the occur-
rences of the members of the pair. We consider only
those co-occurrences where span is less than a given
threshold. Therefore, span threshold is a parameter
for all the co-occurrence measures being considered.
4 Performance Evaluation
Having introduced the revised measures PMIs and
sPMId, we need to evaluate the performance of these
measures compared to PMI and the original mea-
sures introducing significance. In addition, we also
wish to compare the performance of these measures
with other co-occurrence measures. To compare the
performance of these measures with more resource
heavy non co-occurrence based measures, we have
chosen those tasks and datasets on which published
results exist for distributional similarity and knowl-
edge based word association measures.
4.1 Task Details
We evaluate these measures on three tasks: Sen-
tence Similarity(65 sentence-pairs from (Li et al.,
2006)), Synonym Selection(50 questions ESL (Tur-
ney, 2001) and 80 questions TOEFL (Landauer and
Dutnais, 1997) datasets), and, Semantic Related-
ness(353 words Wordsim (Finkelstein et al., 2002)
dataset).
For each of these tasks, gold standard human
judgment results exist. For sentence similarity, fol-
lowing (Li et al., 2006), we evaluate a measure by
the Pearsons correlation between the ranking pro-
duced by the measure and the human ranking. For
synonym selection, we compute the percentage of
correct answers, since there is a unique answer for
each challenge word in the datasets. Semantic relat-
edness has been evaluated by Spearman’s rank cor-
relation with human judgment instead of Pearsons
correlation in literature and we follow the same prac-
tice to make results comparable.
For sentence similarity detection, the algorithm
used by us (Li et al., 2006) assumes that the asso-
ciation scores are between 0 and 1. Hence we nor-
malize the value produced by each measure using

where max and min are computed over all associa-
tion scores for the entire task for a given measure.
4.2 Experimental Results
We use a 1.24 Gigawords Wikipedia corpus for get-
ting co-occurrence statistics. Since co-occurrence
methods have span-threshold as a parameter, we fol-
low the standard methodology of five-fold cross val-
idation. Note that, in addition to span-threshold, cP-
MId and sPMId have an additional parameter ?.
In Table 3, we present the performance of all the
co-occurrence measures considered on all the tasks.
Note that, except GoogleDistance and LLR, all re-
sults for all co-occurrence measures are statistically
significant at p = .05. For completeness of compari-
son, we also include the best known results from lit-
erature for different non co-occurrence based word
association measures on these tasks.
4.3 Performance Analysis and Conclusions
We find that on average, PMIsig and cPMId, the re-
cently introduced measures that incorporate signif-
icance in PMI, do not perform better than PMI on
the given datasets. Both of them perform worse
than PMI on three out of four datasets. By ap-
propriately incorporating significance, we get new
measures PMIs and sPMId that perform better than
PMI(also PMIsig and cPMId respectively) on most
datasets. PMIs improves performance over PMI on
three out of four datasets, while sPMId improves
performance on all four datasets.
The performance improvement of PMIs over
PMIsig and of sPMId over cPMId, is not random.
For example, on the ESL dataset, while the percent-
age of correct answers increases from 58 to 66 from
PMIsig to PMIs, it is not the case that on moving
from PMIsig to PMIs, several correct answers be-
come incorrect and an even larger number of in-
correct answers become correct. As shown in Ta-
ble 4, only one correct answers become incorrect
while seven incorrect answers get corrected. The
same trend holds for most parameters values, and
for moving from cPMId to sPMId. This substanti-
ates the claim that the improvement is not random,
but due to the appropriate incorporation of signifi-
cance, as discussed in Section 2.1.
PMIs and sPMId perform better than not just
PMI, but they perform better than all popular co-
occurrence measures on most of these tasks. When
compared with any other co-occurrence measure,
on three out of four datasets each, both PMIs and
sPMId perform better than that measure. In fact,
PMIs and sPMId perform reasonably well compared
with more resource intensive non co-occurrence
based methods as well. Note that different non co-
occurrence based measures perform well on differ-
ent tasks. We are comparing the performance of a
single measure (say sPMId or PMIs) against the best
measure for each task.
