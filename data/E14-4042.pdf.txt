Abstract
In recent years, microblogs such as Twit-
ter have emerged as a new communication
channel. Twitter in particular has become
the target of a myriad of content-based
applications including trend analysis and
event detection, but there has been little
fundamental work on the analysis of word
usage patterns in this text type. In this
paper — inspired by the one-sense-per-
discourse heuristic of Gale et al. (1992)
— we investigate user-level sense distri-
butions, and detect strong support for “one
sense per tweeter”. As part of this, we con-
struct a novel sense-tagged lexical sample
dataset based on Twitter and a web corpus.
1 Introduction
Social media applications such as Twitter enable
users from all over the world to create and share
web content spontaneously. The resulting user-
generated content has been identified as having
potential in a myriad of applications including
real-time event detection (Petrovi´c et al., 2010),
trend analysis (Lau et al., 2012) and natural dis-
aster response co-ordination (Earle et al., 2010).
However, the dynamism and conversational na-
ture of the text contained in social media can
cause problems for traditional NLP approaches
such as parsing (Baldwin et al., 2013), mean-
ing that most content-based approaches use sim-
ple keyword search or a bag-of-words representa-
tion of the text. This paper is a first step towards
full lexical semantic analysis of social media text,
in investigating the sense distribution of a range
of polysemous words in Twitter and a general-
purpose web corpus.
The primary finding of this paper is that there
are strong user-level lexical semantic priors in
Twitter, equivalent in strength to document-level
lexical semantic priors, popularly termed the “one
sense per discourse” heuristic (Gale et al., 1992).
This has potential implications for future applica-
tions over Twitter which attempt to move beyond a
simple string-based meaning representation to ex-
plicit lexical semantic analysis.
2 Related Work
The traditional approach to the analysis of word-
level lexical semantics is via word sense dis-
ambiguation (WSD), where usages of a given
word are mapped onto discrete “senses” in a pre-
existing sense inventory (Navigli, 2009). The most
popular sense inventory used in WSD research has
been WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), although its fine-
grained sense distinctions have proven to be diffi-
cult to make for human annotators and WSD sys-
tems alike. This has resulted in a move towards
more coarse-grained sense inventories (Palmer et
al., 2004; Hovy et al., 2006; Navigli et al., 2007),
or alternatively away from pre-existing sense in-
ventories altogether, towards joint word sense in-
duction (WSI) and disambiguation (Navigli and
Vannella, 2013; Jurgens and Klapaftis, 2013).
Two heuristics that have proven highly powerful
in WSD and WSI research are: (1) first sense tag-
ging, and (2) one sense per discourse. First sense
tagging is based on the observation that sense dis-
tributions tend to be Zipfian, such that if the pre-
dominant or “first” sense can be identified, simply
tagging all occurrences of a given word with this
sense can achieve high WSD accuracy (McCarthy
et al., 2007). Unsurprisingly, there are significant
differences in sense distributions across domains
(cf. cloud in the COMPUTING and METEOROLOG-
ICAL domains), motivating the need for unsuper-
vised first sense learning over domain-specific cor-
pora (Koeling et al., 2005).
One sense per discourse is the observation that
a given word will often occur with a single sense
across multiple usages in a single document (Gale
215
et al., 1992). Gale et al. established the heuristic
on the basis of 9 ambiguous words using a coarse-
grained sense inventory, finding that the probabil-
ity of a given pair of usages of a word taken from a
given document having the same sense was 94%.
However, Krovetz (1998) found that for a fine-
grained sense inventory, only 67% of words exhib-
ited the single-sense-per-discourse property for all
documents in a corpus.
A radically different view on WSD is word us-
age similarity, whereby two usages of a given
word are rated on a continuous scale for similar-
ity, in isolation of any sense inventory (Erk et al.,
2009). Gella et al. (2013) constructed a word us-
age similarity dataset for Twitter messages, and
developed a topic modelling approach to the task,
building on the work of Lui et al. (2012). To the
best of our knowledge, this has been the only at-
tempt to carry out explicit word-level lexical se-
mantic analysis of Twitter text.
3 Dataset Construction
In order to study sense distributions of words in
Twitter, we need a sense inventory to annotate
against, and also a set of Twitter messages to an-
notate. Further, as a point of comparison for the
sense distributions in Twitter, we require a second
corpus; here we use the ukWaC (Ferraresi et al.,
2008), a corpus built from web documents.
For the sense inventory, we chose the Macmil-
lan English Dictionary Online
1
(MACMILLAN,
hereafter), on the basis of: (1) its coarse-grained
general-purpose sense distinctions, and (2) its reg-
ular update cycle (i.e. it contains many recently-
emerged senses). These criteria are important
in terms of inter-annotator agreement (especially
as we crowdsourced the sense annotation, as de-
scribed below) and also sense coverage. The
other obvious candidate sense inventory which po-
tentially satisfied these criteria was ONTONOTES
(Hovy et al., 2006), but a preliminary sense-
tagging exercise indicated that MACMILLAN bet-
ter captured Twitter-specific usages.
Rather than annotating all words, we opted for
a lexical sample of 20 polysemous nouns, as listed
in Table 1. Our target nouns were selected to span
the high- to mid-frequency range in both Twitter
and the web corpus, and have at least 3 MACMIL-
LAN senses. The average sense ambiguity is 5.5.

3.1 Data Sampling
We sampled tweets from a crawl made using the
Twitter Streaming API from January 3, 2012 to
February 29, 2012. The web corpus was built from
ukWaC (Ferraresi et al., 2008), which was based
on a crawl of the .uk domain from 2007. In con-
trast to ukWaC, the tweets are not restricted to doc-
uments from any particular country.
For both corpora, we first selected only the
English documents using langid.py, an off-the-
shelf language identification tool (Lui and Bald-
win, 2012). We next identified documents which
contained nominal usages of the target words,
based on the POS tags supplied with the corpus
in the case of ukWaC, and the output of the CMU
ARK Twitter POS tagger v2.0 (Owoputi et al.,
2012) in the case of Twitter.
For Twitter, we are interested in not just the
overall lexical distribution of each target noun,
but also per-user lexical distributions. As such,
we construct two Twitter-based datasets: (1)
TWITTER
RAND
, a random sample of 100 usages of
each target noun; and (2) TWITTER
USER
, 5 usages
of each target noun from each member of a ran-
dom sample of 20 Twitter users. Naively select-
ing users for TWITTER
USER
without filtering re-
sulted in a preponderance of messages from ac-
counts that were clearly bots, e.g. from commer-
cial sites with a single post per item advertised for
sale, with artificially-skewed sense distributions.
In order to obtain a more natural set of messages
from “real” people, we introduced a number of
user-level filters, including removing users who
posted the same message with different user men-
tions or hashtags, and users who used the target
nouns more than 50 times over a 2-week period.
From the remaining users, we randomly selected
20 users per target noun, resulting in 20 nouns ×
20 users × 5 messages = 2000 messages.
For ukWaC, we similarly constructed two
datasets: (1) UKWAC
RAND
, a random sample
of 100 usages of each target noun; and (2)
UKWAC
DOC
, 5 usages of each target noun from 20
documents which contained that noun in at least
216
Figure 1: Screenshot of a sense annotation HIT for position
5 sentences. 5 such sentences were selected for
annotation, resulting in a total of 20 nouns × 20
documents × 5 sentences = 2000 sentences.
3.2 Annotation Settings
We sense-tagged each of the four datasets using
Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Each Human
Intelligence Task (HIT) comprised 5 occurrences
of a given target noun, with the target noun high-
lighted in each. Sense definitions and an exam-
ple sentence (where available) were provided from
MACMILLAN. Turkers were free to select multi-
ple sense labels where applicable, in line with best
practice in sense labelling (Mihalcea et al., 2004).
We also provided an “Other” sense option, in cases
where none of the MACMILLAN senses were ap-
plicable to the current usage of the target noun. A
screenshot of the annotation interface for a single
usage is provided in Figure 1.
Of the five sentences in each HIT, one was a
heldout example sentence for one of the senses of
the target noun, taken from MACMILLAN. This
gold-standard example was used exclusively for
quality assurance purposes, and used to filter the
annotations as follows:
1. Accept all HITs from Turkers whose gold-
standard tagging accuracy was ? 80%;
2. Reject all HITs from Turkers whose gold-
standard tagging accuracy was ? 20%;
3. Otherwise, accept single HITs with correct
gold-standard sense tags, or at least 2/4 (non-
gold-standard) annotations in common with
Turkers who correctly annotated the gold-
standard usage; reject any other HITs.
This style of quality assurance has been shown
to be successful for sense tagging tasks on AMT
(Bentivogli et al., 2011; Vuurens et al., 2011), and
resulted in us accepting around 95% of HITs.
In total, the annotation was made up of 500
HITs (= 2000/4 usages per HIT) for each of the
four datasets, each of which was annotated by
5 Turkers. Our analysis of sense distribution is
based on only those HITs which were accepted in
accordance with the above methodology, exclud-
ing the gold-standard items. We arrive at a single
sense label per usage by unweighted voting across
the annotations, allowing multiple votes from a
single Turker in the case of multiple sense annota-
tions. In this, the “Other” sense label is considered
as a discrete sense label.
Relative to the majority sense, inter-annotator
agreement post-filtering was respectably high in
terms of Fleiss’ kappa at ? = 0.64 for both
UKWAC
RAND
and UKWAC
DOC
. For TWITTER
USER
,
the agreement was actually higher at ? = 0.71, but
for TWITTER
RAND
it was much weaker, ? = 0.47.

lic use: http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/

4 Analysis
In TWITTER
USER
, the proportion of users who used
a target noun with one sense across all 5 usages
ranged from 7/20 for form to 20/20 for degree, at
an average of 65%. That is, for 65% of users, a
given noun (with average polysemy = 5.5 senses)
is used with the same sense across 5 separate mes-
sages. For UKWAC
DOC
the proportion of docu-
ments with a single sense of a given target noun

Table 2: Pairwise agreement for each dataset,
based on different partitions of the data (“—” indi-
cates no partitioning, and exhaustive comparison)
across all usages ranged from 1/20 for case to
20/20 for band, at an average of 63%. As such,
the one sense per tweeter heuristic is at least as
strong as the one sense per discourse heuristic in
UKWAC
DOC
.
Looking back to the original work of Gale et
al. (1992), it is important to realise that their re-
ported agreement of 94% was calculated pairwise
between usages in a given document. When we
recalculate the agreement in TWITTER
USER
and
UKWAC
DOC
using this methodology, as detailed
in Table 2 (calculating pairwise agreement within
partitions of the data based on “user” and “docu-
ment”, respectively), we see that the numbers for
our datasets are very close to those of Gale et al.
on the basis of more than twice as many nouns,
and many more instances per noun. Moreover, the
one sense per tweeter trend again appears to be
slightly stronger than the one sense per discourse
heuristic in UKWAC
DOC
.
One possible interpretation of these results is
that they are due to a single predominant sense,
common to all users/documents rather than user-
specific predominant senses. To test this hy-
pothesis, we calculate the pairwise agreement for
TWITTER
USER
and UKWAC
DOC
across all anno-
tations (without partitioning on user/document),
and also for TWITTER
RAND
and UKWAC
RAND
.
The results are, once again, presented in Ta-
ble 2 (with partition indicated as “—” for the
respective datasets), and are substantially lower
in all cases (< 66%). This indicates that the
first sense preference varies considerably between
users/documents. Note that the agreement is
slightly lower for TWITTER
RAND
and UKWAC
RAND
simply because of the absence of the biasing effect
for users/documents.
Comparing TWITTER
RAND
and UKWAC
RAND
,
there were marked differences in first sense pref-
erences, with 8/20 of the target nouns having a
different first sense across the two corpora. One
surprising observation was that the sense distri-
butions in UKWAC
RAND
were in general more
skewed than in TWITTER
RAND
, with the entropy of
the sense distribution being lower (= more biased)
in UKWAC
RAND
for 15/20 of the target nouns.
All datasets included instances of “Other”
senses (i.e. usages which didn’t conform to any
of the MACMILLAN senses), with the highest rel-
ative such occurrence being in TWITTER
RAND
at
12.3%, as compared to 6.6% for UKWAC
RAND
.
Interestingly, the number of such usages in
the user/document-biased datasets was around
half these numbers, at 7.4% and 3.6% for
TWITTER
USER
and UKWAC
DOC
, respectively.
5 Discussion
It is worthwhile speculating why Twitter users
would have such a strong tendency to use a given
word with only one sense. This could arise in
part due to patterns of user behaviour, in a given
Twitter account being used predominantly to com-
ment on a favourite sports team or political events,
and as such is domain-driven. Alternatively, it can
perhaps be explained by the “reactive” nature of
Twitter, in that posts are often emotive responses
to happenings in a user’s life, and while different
things excite different individuals, a given individ-
ual will tend to be excited by events of similar
kinds. Clearly more research is required to test
these hypotheses.
One highly promising direction for this research
would be to overlay analysis of sense distributions
with analysis of user profiles (e.g. Bergsma et al.
(2013)), and test the impact of geospatial and soci-
olinguistic factors on sense preferences. We would
also like to consider the impact of time on the one
sense per tweeter heuristic, and consider whether
“one sense per Twitter conversation” also holds.
To summarise, we have investigated sense dis-
tributions in Twitter and a general web corpus,
over both a random sample of usages and a sample
of usages from a single user/document. We found
strong evidence for Twitter users to use a given
word with a single sense, and also that individual
first sense preferences differ between users, sug-
gesting that methods for determining first senses
on a per user basis could be valuable for lexical se-
mantic analysis of tweets. Furthermore, we found
that sense distributions in Twitter are overall less
skewed than in a web corpus.
