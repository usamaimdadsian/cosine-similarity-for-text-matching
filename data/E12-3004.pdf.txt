Abstract 
Myanmar language and script are unique and 
complex. Up to our knowledge, considerable 
amount of work has not yet been done in 
describing Myanmar script using formal language 
theory. This paper presents manually constructed 
context free grammar (CFG) with “111” 
productions to describe the Myanmar Syllable 
Structure. We make our CFG in conformity with 
the properties of LL(1) grammar so that we can 
apply conventional parsing technique called 
predictive top-down parsing to identify Myanmar 
syllables. We present Myanmar syllable structure 
according to orthographic rules. We also discuss 
the preprocessing step called contraction for 
vowels and consonant conjuncts. We make LL (1) 
grammar in which “1” does not mean exactly one 
character of lookahead for parsing because of the 
above mentioned contracted forms. We use five 
basic sub syllabic elements to construct CFG and 
found that all possible syllable combinations in 
Myanmar Orthography can be parsed correctly 
using the proposed grammar.  
 
1 Introduction 
Formal Language Theory is a common way to 
represent grammatical structures of natural 
languages and programming languages. The 
origin of grammar hierarchy is the pioneering 
work of Noam Chomsky (Noam Chomsky, 
1957). A huge amount of work has been done in 
Natural Language Processing where Chomsky`s 
grammar is used to describe the grammatical 
rules of natural languages. However, formulation 
rules have not been established for grammar for 
Myanmar script. The long term goal of this study 
is to develop automatic syllabification of 
Myanmar polysyllabic words using regular 
grammar and/or finite state methods so that 
syllabified strings can be used for Myanmar 
sorting.   
In this paper, as a preliminary stage, we describe 
the structure of a Myanmar syllable in context-
free grammar and parse the syllables using 
predictive top-down parsing technique to 
determine whether a given syllable can be 
recognized by the proposed grammar or not. 
Further, the constructed grammar includes 
linguistic information and follows the traditional 
writing system of Myanmar script.       
 
2 Myanmar Script 
Myanmar is a syllabic script and also one of the 
languages which have complex orthographic 
structures. Myanmar words are formed by 
collection of syllables and each syllable may 
contain up to seven different sub syllabic 
elements. Again, each component group has its 
own members having specific order.  
Basically, Myanmar script has 33 consonants, 8 
vowels (free standing and attached)1 , 2 diacritics, 
11 medials, a vowel killer or ASAT, 10 digits 
and 2 punctuation marks.  
A Myanmar syllable consists of 7 different 
components in Backus Normal Form (BNF) is as 
follows. 
S:= C{M}{V}[CK][D] | I[CK] | N 
where   
   S   = Syllable 
1. C  = Consonant                                          
2. M = Medial or Consonant Conjunct or 
attached consonant      
                                                          
1 Free standing vowel syllables (eg. ? )and attached vowel 
symbols (eg.   ) 
32
3. V = Attached Vowel 
4. K = Vowel Killer or ASAT 
5. D = Diacritic 
6. I  = Free standing Vowel 
7. N =  Digit 
And the notation [ ] means 0 or 1 occurrence and 
{ } means 0 or more occurrence.  
However, in this paper, we ignore digits, free 
standing vowel and punctuation marks in writing 
grammar for Myanmar syllable and we focus 
only on basic and major five sub syllabic groups 
namely consonants(C), medial(M), attached 
vowels(V), a vowel killer (K) and diacritics(D). 
The following subsection will give the details of 
each sub syllabic group.  
 
2.1 Brief Description of Basic Myanmar 
Sub Syllabic Elements 
 
Each Myanmar consonant has default vowel 
sound and itself works as a syllable. The set of 
consonants in Unicode chart is C={?, ?, ?, ?, 
?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? , ? ,? ,?, ?, ??, ?, ?, 
? ,? ,? ,? ,? ,?, ?, ? ,? ,? ,?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 
? } having 33 elements. But, the letter ? can act 
as consonant as well as free standing vowel.  
 
Medials or consonant conjuncts mean the 
modifiers of the syllables` vowel and they are 
encoded separately in the Unicode encoding. 
There are four basic medials in Unicode chart 
and it is represented as the set M={    ,   ,   }. 
 
The set V of Myanmar attached vowel characters 
in Unicode contains 8 elements { ?,  ,  ,  ,  ,  
 , ,  }. ( Peter and William, 1996) 
 
Diacritics alter the vowel sounds of 
accompanying consonants and they are used to 
indicate tone level. There are 2 diacritical marks 
{  ,   } in Myanmar script and the set is 
represented as D.  
 
The asat, or  killer, representing the set K= {   } 
is a visibly displayed sign. In some cases it 
indicates that the inherent vowel sound of a 
consonant letter is suppressed. In other cases it 
combines with other characters to form a vowel 
letter. Regardless of its function, this visible sign 
is always represented by the character U+103A .2 
[John Okell, 1994] 
 
In Unicode chart, the diacritics group D and the 
vowel killer or ASAT “K” are included in the 
group named various signs. 
 
2.2  Preprocessing of Texts - Contraction 
 
In writing formal grammar for a Myanmar 
syllable, there are some cases where two or more 
Myanmar characters combine each other and the 
resulting combined forms are also used in 
Myanmar traditional writing system though they 
are not coded directly in the Myanmar Unicode 
chart. Such combinations of vowel and medials 
are described in detail below. 
Two or more Myanmar attached vowels are 
combined and formed new three members {  , 
   ,     } in the vowel set.

Similarly, 4 basic Myanmar medials combine 
each other in some different ways and produce 
new set of medials {  ,   ,   ,   ,    ,     
  ,       }. [Tin Htay Hlaing and Yoshiki

The above mentioned combinations of characters 
are considered as one vowel or medial in 
constructing the grammar. The complete sets of 
elements for vowels and meidals used in writing 
grammar are depicted in the table below.3

2.3 Combinations of Syllabic Components 
within a Syllable 
 
As mentioned in the earlier sections, we choose 
only 5 basic sub syllabic components namely 
consonants (C), medial (M), attached vowels (V), 
vowel killer (K) and diacritics (D) to describe 
Myanmar syllable. As our intended use for 
syllabification is for sorting, we omit stand-alone 
vowels and digits in describing Myanmar 
syllable structure. Further, according to the 
sorting order of Myanmar Orthography, stand-
alone vowels are sorted as the syllable using the 
above 5 sub syllabic elements having the same 
pronunciation. For example, stand-alone vowel  
“?” is sorted as consonant “?” and attached 
vowel “ ” combination as  “? ”. 
                                                          
3 Sorting order of Medials and attached vowels in Myanmar 
Orthography 
In Myanmar language, a syllable with only one 
consonant can be taken as one syllable because 
Myanmar script is Abugida which means all 
letters have inherent vowel. And, consonants can 
be followed by vowels, consonant, vowel killer 
and medials in different combinations.  
One special feature is that if there are two 
consonants in a given syllable, the second 
consonant must be followed by vowel killer (K). 
We found that 1872 combinations of sub-syllabic 
elements in Myanmar Orthography [Myanmar 
Language Commission, 2006]. The table below 
shows top level combinations of these sub-
syllabic elements.

“Table 4. Possible Combinations within a Syllable” 
 
The combinations among five basic sub syllabic 
components can also be described using Finite 
State Automaton. We also find that Myanmar 
orthographic syllable structure can be described 
in regular grammar.

In the above FSA, an interesting point is that 
only one consonant can be a syllable because 
Myanmar consonants have default vowel sounds. 
That is why, state 2 can be a final state. For 
instance, a Myanmar Word “? ? ?” (means 
“Woman” in English) has two syllables. In the 
first syllable “? ? ”, the sub syllabic elements are 
Consonant(?) + Vowel( ) +Consonant(?)+ 
Vowel Killer( )+Diacritics( ). The second 
syllable has only one consonant “?”. 
 
3 Myanmar Syllable Structure in      
Context-Free Grammar 
 
3.1 Manually Constructed Context-Free 
Grammar for Myanmar Syllable 
Structure 
 
Context free (CF) grammar refers to the grammar 
rules of languages which are formulated 
independently of any context. A CF-grammar is 
defined by: 
1. A finite terminal vocabulary VT. 
2. A finite auxiliary vocabulary VA. 
3. An axiom S?VA. 
4. A finite number of context-free rules P 
of the form A?? where 
A?VA and ? ?{VA U VT}*                           
(M.Gross and A.Lentin, 1970) 
 
The grammar G to represent all possible 
structures of a Myanmar syllable can be written 
as G= (VT,VA,P,S) where the elements of  P are: 
S?? X     
# Such production will be expanded for 33 
consonants. 
X?   A     
# Such production will be expanded for 11 
medials. 
X?   B    
# Such production will be expanded for 12 
vowels. 
X?C   D  
X?? 
A?    B   
# Such production will be expanded for 12 
vowels. 
A? C   D 
A?? 
B ? C   D 
B? D 
B?? 
D?     # Diacritics 
D?     # Diacritics 
D? ?  
C? ?   
      # Such production will be expanded for 33 
consonants. 
Total number of productions/rules to recognize 
Myanmar syllable structure is “111” and we 
found that the director symbol sets (which is also 
known as first and follow sets) for same non-
terminal symbols with different productions are 
disjoint.   
This is the property of LL(1) grammar which 
means for each non terminal that appears on the 
left side of more than one production, the 
directory symbol sets of all the productions in 
which it appears on the left side are disjoint. 
Therefore, our proposed grammar can be said as 
LL(1) grammar.  
The term LL1 is made up as follows. The first L 
means reading from Left to right, the second L 
means using Leftmost derivations, and the “1” 
means with one symbol of lookahead. (Robin 
Hunter, 1999) 
 
3.2 Parse Table for Myanmar CFG 
The following figure is a part of parse table made 
from the productions of the proposed LL(1) 
grammar.

“Table 5. Parse Table for Myanmar Syllable” 
35
In the above table, the topmost row represents 
terminal symbols whereas the leftmost column 
represents the non terminal symbols. The entries 
in the table are productions to apply for each pair 
of non terminal and terminal. 
 
An example of Myanmar syllable having 4 
different sub syllabic elements is parsed using 
proposed grammar and the above parse table. 
The parsing steps show proper working of the 
proposed grammar and the detail of parsing a 
syllable is as follows.  
Input Syllable = ?     =?(C) +  (M)+   
      (D)

4 Conclusion 
 
This study shows the powerfulness of 
Chomsky`s context free grammar as it can apply 
not only to describe the sentence structure but 
also the syllable structure of an Asian script, 
Myanmar. Though the number of productions in 
the proposed grammar for Myanmar syllable is 
large, the syntactic structure of a Myanmar 
syllable is correctly recognized and the grammar 
is not ambiguous.  
Further, in parsing Myanmar syllable, it is 
necessary to do preprocessing called contraction 
for input sequences of vowels and consonant 
conjuncts or medials to meet the requirements of 
traditional writing systems. However, because of 
these contracted forms, single lookahead symbol 
in our proposed LL(1) grammar does not refer 
exactly to one character and it may be a 
combination of two or more characters in parsing 
Myanmar syllable. 
 
5 Discussion and Future Work 
 
Myanmar script is syllabic as well as 
aggulutinative script. Every Myanmar word or 
sentence is composed of series of individual 
syllables. Thus, it is critical to have efficient way 
of recognizing syllables in conformity with the 
rules of Myanmar traditional writing system. 
Our intended research is the automatic 
syllabification of Myanmar polysyllabic words 
using formal language theory. 
One option to do is to modify our current CFG to 
recognize consecutive syllables as a first step. 
We found that if the current CFG is changed for 
sequence of syllables, the grammar can be no 
longer LL(1). Then, we need to use one of the 
statistical methods, for example, probabilistic 
CFG, to choose correct productions or best parse 
for finding syllable boundaries. 
Again, it is necessary to calculate the probability 
values for each production based on the 
frequency of occurrence of a syllable in a 
dictionary we referred or using TreeBank.  
We need Myanmar corpus or a tree bank which 
contains evidence for rule expansions for syllable 
structure and such a resource does not yet exist 
for Myanmar. And also, the time and cost for 
constructing a corpus by ourselves came into 
consideration.  
Another approach is to construct finite state 
transducer for automatic syllabification of 
Myanmar words. If we choose this approach, we 
firstly need to construct regular grammar to 
recognize Myanmar syllables. We already have 
Myanmar syllable structure in regular grammar. 
However, for finite state syllabification using 
weights, there is a lack of resource for training 
database. 
We still have many language specific issues to be 
addressed for implementing Myanmar script 
using CFG or FSA. As a first issue, our current 
grammar is based on five basic sub-syllabic 
elements and thus developing the grammar 
which can handle all seven Myanmar sub 
syllabic elements will be future study.  
Our current grammar is based on the code point 
values of the input syllables or words. Then, as a 
second issue, we need to consider about different 
presentations or code point values of same 
character. Moreover, we have special writing 
traditions for some characters, for example, such 
36
as consonant stacking eg. § ?? Buddha), «??    
(Mandalay, second capital of Myanmar), 
consonant repetition eg.  ?    (University), 
kinzi eg. ¿io   (Cement), loan words eg. 
©  v  (bus). To represent such complex forms 
in a computer system, we use invisible Virama 
sign (U+1039). Therefore, it is necessary to 
construct the productions which have conformity 
with the stored character code sequence of 
Myanmar Language.
