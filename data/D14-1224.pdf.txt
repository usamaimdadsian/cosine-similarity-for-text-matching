Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a Connective-
driven Dependency Tree (CDT) scheme 
to represent the discourse rhetorical 
structure in Chinese language, with ele-
mentary discourse units as leaf nodes 
and connectives as non-leaf nodes, large-
ly motivated by the Penn Discourse 
Treebank and the Rhetorical Structure 
Theory. In particular, connectives are 
employed to directly represent the hier-
archy of the tree structure and the rhetor-
ical relation of a discourse, while the nu-
clei of discourse units are globally de-
termined with reference to the depend-
ency theory. Guided by the CDT scheme, 
we manually annotate a Chinese Dis-
course Treebank (CDTB) of 500 docu-
ments. Preliminary evaluation justifies 
the appropriateness of the CDT scheme 
to Chinese discourse analysis and the 
usefulness of our manually annotated 
CDTB corpus. 
1 Introduction 
It is well-known that interpretation of a text re-
quires understanding of its rhetorical relation 
hierarchy since discourse units rarely exist in 
isolation. Such discourse structure is fundamen-
tal to many text-based applications, such as 
summarization (Marcu, 2000) and question-
answering (Verberne et al., 2007). Due to the 
wide and potential use of discourse structure, 
constructing discourse resources has been at-
tracting more and more attention in recent years. 
In comparison with English, there are much 
fewer discourse resources for Chinese which 
largely restricts the researches in Chinese dis-
course analysis. 
The general notion of discourse structure 
mainly consists of discourse unit, connective, 
structure, relation and nuclearity. However, pre-
vious studies on discourse failed to fully express 
these kinds of information. For example, the 
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and 
Thompson, 1988) represents a discourse as a 
tree with phrases or clauses as elementary dis-
course units (EDUs). However, RST ignores the 
importance of connectives to a great extent. Fig-
ure 1 gives an example tree structure with four 
EDUs (e1-e4). In comparison, Penn Discourse 
Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) adopts 
the predicate-argument view of discourse rela-
tion, with discourse connective as predicate and 
two text spans as its arguments. Example (1) 
shows an explicit reason relation signaled by the 
discourse connective “particularly if” and an 
implicit result relation represented by the insert-
ed discourse connective “so”, with Arg1 in ital-
ics and Arg2 in bold. However, as a connective 
and its arguments are determined in a local con-
textual window, it is normally difficult to deduce 
a complete discourse structure from such a con-
nective-argument scheme. In this sense, the 
PDTB at best only provides a partial solution to 
the discourse structure.

Obviously, both RST and PDTB have their 
own advantages and disadvantages in represent-
ing different characteristics of the discourse 
structure. In this paper, we attempt to propose a 
new scheme to Chinese discourse structure, 
adopt advantages of the tree structure from RST 
and connective from PDTB. Meanwhile, the 
special characteristics of Chinese discourse 
structure are well addressed. 
First, it is difficult to define EDU in Chinese 
due to the frequent occurrence of the ellipsis of 
subjects, objects and predicates, and the lack of 
functional marks for EDU. Second, the connec-
tives in Chinese omit much more frequently than 
those in English with about 82.0% vs. 54.5% in 
Zhou and Xue (2012). In Example (2), there are 
even no explicit connectives. Third, previous 
studies have shown the difference in classifying 
Chinese discourse relations from English (Xing, 
2001; Huang and Liao, 2011). This suggests that 
the discourse relations defined for English (both 
RST and PDTB) are not readily suitable for 
Chinese. Finally, the nucleus of a Chinese dis-
course relation is normally not directly related to 
a particular relation type but should be dynami-
cally determined from the global meaning of a 
discourse.

In this paper, we present a Connective-driven 
Dependency Tree (CDT) discourse representa-
tion scheme, which takes advantage of both RST 
and PDTB, with elementary discourse units 
(limited to clauses) as leaf nodes and connec-
tives as non-leaf nodes. Especially, we define 
EDU from three aspects, and employ the con-
nective’ level and semantic to indicate the rhe-
torical structure and the discourse relation. Be-
sides, the nuclearity of discourse units in a dis-
course relation is decided on the overall dis-
course meaning. On the basis, we adopt the CDT 
scheme to annotate a certain scale corpus, called 
Chinese Discourse Treebank (CDTB) thereafter 
in this paper. Evaluation shows the appropriate-
ness of the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse 
analysis. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 overviews related work. In Section 3, 
we present the CDT discourse representation 
scheme. In Section 4, we describe the annotation 
of the CDTB corpus. Section 5 compares CDTB 
with other major discourse corpora. Section 6 
gives the experimental results on EDU recogni-
tion, the crucial step for discourse parsing. Final-
ly, conclusion is given in section 7. 
2 Related Work 
In the past decade, several discourse corpora for 
English have emerged, with the Rhetorical 
Structure Theory Discourse Treebank (RST-DT) 
(Carlson et al., 2003) and the Penn Discourse 
Treebank (PDTB) (Prasad et al., 2008) most 
prevalent. 
In the RST framework, a text is represented as 
a discourse tree, with non-overlapping text spans 
(either phrases or clauses) as leaves, and adja-
cent nodes are related through particular rhetori-
cal relations to form a discourse sub-tree, which 
is then related to other adjacent nodes in the tree 
structure. According to RST, there are two types 
of discourse relations, mononuclear and multi-
nuclear. Figure 1 shows an example of discourse 
tree representation, following the notational 
convention of RST. Among the four EDUs (e1-
e4), e1 and e2 are connected by a mononuclear 
relation “attribution”, where e1 is the nucleus, 
the span (e1-e2) and the EDU e3 are further 
connected by a multi-nuclear relation “same-
unit”, where they are equally salient. Annotated 
according to the RST framework, the RST-DT 
consists of 385 documents from the Wall Street 
Journal (WSJ). Besides, the original 24 dis-
course relations defined by Mann and Thompson 
(1988) are further divided into a set of 18 rela-
tion classes with 78 finer grained rhetorical rela-
tions in RST-DT. 
As the largest discourse corpus so far, the 
Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) contains over 
one million words from WSJ. With EDUs lim-
ited to clauses, the PDTB adopts the predicate-
2106
 argument view of discourse relations, with con-
nective as predicate and two text spans as its 
arguments. Example (1) shows two annotation 
tokens for the connective “particularly if” and 
“so”. The current version of PDTB 2.0 annotates 
40600 tokens, including 18459 explicit relations 
of 100 distinct types (e.g. “particularly if” and 
“if” are the same type) and 16224 implicit dis-
course relations of 102 distinct token types. Be-
sides, PDTB provides a three level hierarchy of 
relation tags with the first level consisting of 
four major relation classes (Temporal, Contin-
gency, Comparison, and Expansion), which are 
further divided into 16 types and 23 subtypes. 
In comparison, there are few researches on 
Chinese discourse annotation (Xue, 2005a; Chen, 
2006; Yue, 2008; Huang and Chen, 2011; Zhou 
and Xue, 2012), with no exception employing 
existing RST or PDTB frameworks. For exam-
ple, Zhou and Xue (2012) use the PDTB annota-
tion guidelines to annotate Chinese discourse 
with 98 files from Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 
2005b) of Xinhua newswire. In particular, they 
adopt a lexically grounded approach and make 
some adaptation based on the linguistic and sta-
tistical characteristics of Chinese text, with Arg1 
and Arg2 defined semantically and the senses of 
discourse relations annotated besides connec-
tives and their lexical alternatives. The agree-
ment on relation types reaches 95.1% and the 
agreement on implicit relations with exact span 
match reaches 76.9%. 
Instead, Chen (2006) and Yue (2008) use RST 
to annotate Chinese discourse. Chen (2006) se-
lects comma as the segmentation signal of EDUs 
(in Example (2), “??(According to reports)” 
will be segmented as an EDU), and finds that 
RST fails to deal with some special features of 
Chinese. Yue (2008) manually annotates a set of 
97 texts according to RST and shows the cross-
lingual transferability of RST to Chinese. How-
ever, it also shows that EDUs in Chinese are 
much different from those in English, and many 
relation types in Chinese have no correspond-
ence to English, and vice versa. 
3 Connective-driven Dependency Tree 
An appropriate representation scheme is funda-
mental to linguistic resource construction. With 
reference to various theories and representation 
scheme on the tree structure and nuclearity of 
RST, the connective, relation and discourse 
structure of Chinese complex sentence (Xing, 
2001), the sentence-group theory (Cao, 1984), 
the connective treatment of PDTB, the conjunc-
tion dependent analysis (Feng and Ji, 2011) and 
the center theory of dependency grammar (Hays, 
1964), we propose a new discourse representa-
tion scheme for Chinese, called Connective-
driven Dependency Tree (CDT), with EDUs as 
leaf nodes and connectives as non-leaf nodes, to 
accommodate the special characteristics of the 
Chinese language in discourse structure. 
For instance, Example (3) consists of 2 sen-
tences, which is part of a paragraph from 
“chtb_0001”, and its corresponding CDT repre-
sentation is shown in Figure 2. Here, the number 
of “|” in Example (3) stands for the level of 
EDUs in CDT and the numbers marked in Fig-
ure 2 (such as 1, 2 etc.) distinguish EDUs. While 
an arrow points to the main EDU or main dis-
course unit (called nucleus), the combination of 
different EDUs can be considered as EDUs in a 
higher level and the new discourse units can thus 
be combined into higher-level units from bottom 
to up. In this way, the discourse structure can be 
expressed as a tree structure via bottom-up com-
bination of EDUs.  
Obviously, such discourse structure is con-
structed by two kinds of basic units, EDUs (leaf 
nodes) and connectives (non-leaf nodes). On the 
one hand, connectives can represent the dis-
course structure by its hierarchical level in the 
tree. The discourse structure is independent on 
the connective level essentially, rather than the 
reverse. On the other hand, connectives them-
selves can represent the discourse relation. This 
is why we call the scheme “Connective-driven”. 
As for the abstract discourse relation, we can 
construct a set of discourse relations, mapping a 
connective to discourse relation, according to the 
users’ specific requirements.

3.1 Elementary Discourse Unit 
As the leaf nodes of CDT, EDUs are limited to 
clauses. In principle, EDUs play a crucial role to 
discourse analysis. Since from bottom-up dis-
course combination, EDUs are the start of dis-
course analysis, while from top-down discourse 
segmentation, they are the end of discourse 
analysis. Unfortunately, since there lacks obvi-
ous distinction between Chinese sentence struc-
ture and phrase structure, it is rather difficult to 
define Chinese EDU (clause). Till now, there is 
still no widely accepted definition in the Chinese 
linguistics community (Wang, 2010). Inspired 
by Li et al. (2013a), we give the definition of 
Chinese EDU from three perspectives. First, 
from the syntactic structure perspective, an EDU 
should contain at least one predicate and express 
at least one proposition. Second, from the func-
tional perspective, an EDU should be related to 
other EDUs with some propositional function, 
i.e. not act as a grammatical element of other 
EDUs. Finally, from the morphological perspec-
tive, an EDU should be segmented by some 
punctuation, e.g. comma, semicolon and period. 
We use punctuation because there usually has a 
pause between clauses (EDUs), which can be 
shown in written commas, semicolons etc 
(Huang and Liao, 2011). Normally, it is easy to 
handle complex sentences and special sentence 
patterns (e.g. serial predicate sentences). For 
Example (4), A) is a single sentence with serial 
predicate; B) is complex sentence with two 
EDUs (clauses): 
Example (4): EDU examples 
A) He opened the door and went out. (single sentence, 
serial predicate, one EDU) 
B) 1 He opened the door,| 2 and went out. (complex sen-
tence, two EDUs) 
Take as example, there exist 7 EDUs in Ex-
ample (3), each marked with a number in front. 
According to our definition, the fragment “??
????…???? ”(“work for a short 
time…has been accumulated” ) in EDU 3 is not 
segmented as a EDU since: 1) it acts as a gram-
matical element of other EDUs and has no direct 
relationship with other EDUs on propositional 
function; 2) it is marked by a pair of quotation 
marks and does not end with any punctuation. In 
contrast, the fragment “??????…???
? ”(“but learn developed…legality track.”) is 
segment as 4 EDUs since it meets the three crite-
ria in our EDU definition. 
3.2 Connective 
As non-leaf nodes in the CDT representation, 
connectives connect EDUs or discourse units. 
Thus, the main criterion of determining whether 
an expression is a connective is to check wheth-
er the two fragments it connects are EDUs (or 
discourse units). In our scheme, the list of ex-
plicit discourse connectives is judged by a data 
driven approach, i.e. with any discourse-like 
word or phrase marked as connective in the an-
notation practice, e.g. “??(therefore)”, “??
(to this)”, “??...??...(is not...but....)”, “?(so 
that), “???(just because)” in Example (3), 
“? ...??(first...then) ”, “???(and at the 
same time)” in Example (5). 
Example (5): Connective examples from CTB 
A) 1<?????>???????| 2??????
?????????|| 3????????????
??(chtb_0001) 
1<If ; As long as>The construction company enters the 
region, |2 first the appropriate bureau delivers these regu-
latory documents,|| 3 Then there is a specialized contin-
gent that carries out a supervisory inspection. 
B) 1????…, 2?? ? ??????????
?????(chtb_0031) 
2108
 1 The processing trade …, | 2 and at the same time 
is important content in the economic and trade coop-
eration between Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao and 
Taiwan. 
It is worthy of mention that from the part-of-
speech perspective, connectives are not 
necessarily conjunctions. For example, in 
Example (3) and (5), adverbs “?...??(first… 
then)”, verb phrases “??…??(is not…but)”, 
and preposition phrases “?? (to this)” are 
determined as connectives. From the 
morphological perspective, a connective may 
contain more than one word, even discontinuous. 
As a common occurring phenomenon in Chinese 
discourse, there exist many paired Chinese 
connectives, e.g. “??…?? (is not…but)” in 
Figure 2. Even in some paired connectives, such 
as “??…?? (because…so)”, a word in a 
paired connective can appear independently as a 
connective. Please note that this may not be 
applied to other cases, e.g. “??…??  (is 
not…but)” as appeared in Example (3). Moreo-
ver, in many cases whether an expression is a 
connective or not depends on its meaning, e.g., 
“?  (in order to)” is a connective, while “? 
(for)” is not. For the positional distribution, a 
connective may appear anywhere, i.e. in the be-
ginning, middle, or the end of the first or second 
EDU. Example (3) and (5) show some of cases 
in different positions. The above characteristics 
pose special challenges on connective determi-
nation in Chinese language.  
According to the appearance of a connective 
or not, a discourse relation can be either explicit 
or implicit. Previous studies have shown the dif-
ficulty of implicit relation recognition in English 
due to the omission of connectives (Pitler et al., 
2009; Lin et al., 2009). This becomes even 
worse in Chinese since compared with the im-
plicit ratio of 54.5% in English connectives, this 
ratio rises up to about 82% in Chinese (Zhou and 
Xue, 2012). It is worth noting that the majority 
of discourse relations in Chinese are implicit, so 
the insertion of a connective in an implicit posi-
tion can significantly ease the understanding of 
the discourse. That is, a connective driven repre-
sentation scheme is still applicable to a discourse 
with implicit connectives. To help determine 
implicit relations, two special strategies are pro-
posed. 
First, for each explicit connective, a decision 
is made whether or not it can be deleted without 
changing the rhetorical relation of a discourse. It 
should be emphasized that this constraint is 
largely semantic. The motivation behind the re-
moval of explicit connectives is to enlarge im-
plicit instances and help recognize implicit rela-
tions. As shown in Figure 2, we use the paired 
mark “()” to indicate that a connective can be 
deleted, e.g. connectives “(?? to this)”, “(?? 
therefore)”, “(??? just because)”, and the 
paired mark “{}” to indicate that a connective 
cannot be deleted, e.g. connectives “{? so 
that}”, “{??…?? is not…but}”. 
Second, since a connective can be inserted to 
represent an implicit relation, our scheme tries to 
insert a connective which can be easily inter-
preted from the semantic perspective with little 
ambiguity into the most appropriate place. Most 
of the connective insertions for implicit relations 
occur between adjacent discourse spans. It is 
worth noting that not all implicit connectives are 
subjective to the language sense. To mark this 
difference, we cluster implicit connectives into 
two categories according to their language sens-
es, either “good language intuition” or “bad lan-
guage intuition”. In our scheme, we use the 
paired mark “<>”to indicate inserted implicit 
connectives, e.g. connectives“<?? e.g.>”, “<
? but>” with “good language sense”, connec-
tive “<?? and>” with “bad language sense”, as 
shown in Figure 2. 
In some cases, it is possible that there exist 
several insertion options for an implicit connec-
tive due to the ambiguity in a discourse. For ex-
ample, in Example (5A), connectives “?? (if)” 
and “?? (as long as)” are inserted into the first 
level to show the two discourse relation options. 
As far as this happens, connectives are inserted 
and ordered according to annotators’ first intui-
tion. 
3.3 Discourse Structure 
In Figure 2, the paragraph is organized as a tree 
structure, in which EDUs appear in the leaf 
nodes and the connectives appear in the non-leaf 
ones. The adoption of tree structure conforms to 
traditional Chinese discourse theories and prac-
tice. For example, a native Chinese speaker 
tends to determine the overall level boundary 
first and then the analysis goes on step by step to 
the individual clauses, when understanding a 
complex sentence. This process naturally forms 
a tree structure. Besides, tree structure is easier 
to formalize, compared with graph.  
More specifically, the hierarchical structure of 
connectives indicates the hierarchical structure 
of discourse units. Apparently, discourse struc-
2109
 ture analysis can be viewed as hierarchical anal-
ysis of connectives, with hierarchical connective 
structure reflecting hierarchical combination of 
discourse units. Essentially, the discourse hierar-
chy indicates the correlation degrees of semantic 
relations in the discourse, the deeper tree level of 
two discourse units, the higher correlation de-
gree of their semantic relation. Therefore, a dis-
course relation is the ultimate factor for the 
choice of hierarchical discourse structure. For a 
reference, please take Sentence 2 in Figure 2 as 
an example. 
3.4 Discourse Relation  
For discourse relation representation, a general 
approach is to assign an abstract relation type to 
a discourse relation directly, such as cause, con-
junction, condition, purpose, etc, as done in 
RST-DT and PDTB. In our CDT scheme, we 
avoid to directly assign an abstract relation type 
to a discourse relation. Instead, we use the con-
nective itself to express the discourse relation, as 
shown in Figure 2. In this way, the difficulty of 
pre-defining a set of acknowledged discourse 
relations and selecting an exact discourse rela-
tion can be avoided during the corpus annotation 
process. Since a Chinese discourse relation is 
largely controlled by connective (Xing, 2001), 
the key to determine a relation is to identify a 
suitable connective. Normally, most of relation 
annotations can easily map from connectives to 
abstract semantic classes of relations, if neces-
sary, with the help of the discourse context. The 
majority of discourse relations in Chinese are 
implicit, but it makes sense to insist on a con-
nective driven representation. With connective 
as a bridge, at least it makes discourse represen-
tation easier. 
For the abstraction of discourse relations, we 
leave it in a later separate stage. Of course, there 
are cases where a connective may represent 
more than one discourse relation. For example, 
connective “?” can denotes the continuous rela-
tion “? (especially)” and the transitional rela-
tion “? (however)”. Compared with annotating 
discourse relation directly, annotator's intuition 
is more accurate for specific connective. We 
don't object to label discourse relation, referring 
to the general work and Chinese analysis prac-
tice, give a set of relations (Figure 3), regarding 
it as connective's semantics, and then annotate 
the connective with it. In this way, we can obtain 
a general relation set and resolve the connec-
tive's polysemy problem. We believe that the 
connective itself is the foundation of discourse 
relation, and the relation set can be adjusted dy-
namically according to the application require-
ments. 
Figure 3 shows a three-level set of discourse 
relations example. In the first level, this set con-
tains four relations of causality, coordination, 
transition and explanation, which are further 
clustered into 17 sub-relations in the second lev-
el. For example, relation causality contains 6 
sub-relations, i.e. cause-result, inference, hypo-
thetical, purpose, condition and background. In 
the third level, the connectives are under each 
sub-relation. For example, cause-result relation 
can be represented by “because”, 'therefore' etc. 
The numbers shown in the parentheses illustrate 
the distributions of different relations in our cor-
pus. For example, there are 1335 causality rela-
tions in the first level, including 686 cause-result 
relations, 38 inference relations, 70 hypothetical 
relations, 335 purpose relations, 72 condition 
relations and 134 background relations.

Figure 3: A three-level set of discourse relations 
3.5 Nucleus and Satellite 
Once discourse units are determined, adjacent 
spans are linked together via connectives to 
build a hierarchical structure. As stated above, 
discourse relations may be either mononuclear 
or multi-nuclear. A mononuclear relation holds 
between a nucleus and a satellite unit. Normally, 
the nucleus usually reflects the intention focus of 
the discourse and is thus more salient in the dis-
course structure, while the satellite usually rep-
resents supportive information for the nucleus. 
In comparison, a multi-nuclear relation usually 
2110
 holds two or more discourse units of equal 
weight in the discourse structure.  
For nucleus determination, we adopt the de-
pendency grammar, and select the unit which 
can stand for the relationship with other dis-
course units in a discourse. As shown in Figure 
2, on the first level, discourse relation “?? (to 
this)” has the latter unit “??…????
(Pudong…as soon as they appear.)” as nucleus and 
the former unit “??…??? (Pudong …new 
problem)” as satellite, since the latter unit agrees 
with the main purpose of the discourse, which 
emphasizes some methods for the progress of 
Pudong. Moreover, since the combination of 4, 5 
and 6 has the cause relation with 7, we choose 7 
as nucleus because it can stand for the combina-
tion of 4, 5, 6 and 7, and has the selection rela-
tionship with 3. 
4 Chinese Discourse Treebank 
Given above the CDT scheme, we choose 500 
Xinhua newswire documents from the Chinese 
Treebank (Xue et al., 2005b) in our Chinese 
Discourse Treebank (CDTB) annotation. In par-
ticular, we annotate one discourse tree for each 
paragraph. 
In this section, we address the key issues with 
the CDTB annotation, such as annotator training, 
tagging strategies, corpus quality, along with the 
statistics of the CDTB corpus. 
4.1 Annotator Training 
The annotator team consists of a Ph.D. in Chi-
nese linguistics as the supervisor (senior annota-
tor) and four undergraduate students in Chinese 
linguistics as annotators (two pairs). The annota-
tion is done in four phases. In the first phase, the 
annotators spend 3 months on learning the prin-
ciples of CDT and the use of our developed dis-
course annotation tool. In the second phase, the 
annotators spend 2 months on independently 
annotating the same 50 documents (about 260 
paraphrases), and another 2 months on cross-
checking to resolve the difference and to revise 
the guidelines. In the third phase, the annotators 
spend 9 months on annotating the remaining 450 
documents. In the final phase, the supervisor 
spends 3 months carefully proofread all 500 
documents. 
4.2 Tagging Strategies 
In the CDTB annotation, we employ a top-down 
strategy. That is, we determine the overall level 
first and then the analysis goes on step by step to 
the individual EDUs. This strategy is adopted in 
our annotation tool. The advantages of the top-
down strategy are three folds. First, such a strat-
egy can easily grasp the whole discourse struc-
ture. This conforms to the global nature of dis-
course analysis. Second, due to the lack of clear 
difference between Chinese sentence and phrase 
structure, such a strategy can largely avoid the 
error propagation in Chinese EDU segmentation. 
Since in such a top-down strategy, EDU seg-
mentation becomes an end question, and even if 
an EDU segmentation error happens, its impact 
is localized, i.e. with little impact on the whole 
discourse structure. Our annotation practice 
shows that such strategy is effective. Third, such 
a strategy accords with the cognitive of Chinese 
characteristics, and conforms to the mental pro-
cess of Chinese discourse understanding (Huang 
and Liao, 2011). However, we do not exclude 
the bottom-up strategy. In some cases, on the 
cognitive psychological process, annotator is 
combine top-down and bottom-up strategies. 
Take Example (3) as an example, an annotator 
first finds the first level, with the period at the 
end of sentence 1, and chooses discourse rela-
tion (either explicit or implicit), connective, and 
connective related information (e.g. whether can 
be added, deleted, and the language sense, etc.), 
nuclearity etc. Then, the annotator turns to sen-
tence 1 and marks the second comma as level 2 
with necessary information annotated, and goes 
on to sentence 2, recursively, until all EDUs are 
marked. In this way, a discourse tree with the 
CDT representation is constructed. 
4.3 Quality Assurance 
A number of steps are taken to ensure the quality 
of CDTB. These involve two tasks: checking the 
validity of the trees and tracking inter-annotator 
consistency. 
4.3.1 Tree validation 
We first manually check if a tree has a single 
root node and compare the tree with the docu-
ment to check for missing sentence or fragments 
from the end of text. Then we check the attached 
information such as connectives, relations and 
nuclearity in the tree. We also check the tree 
with a tree traversal program to find the errors 
undetected by the manual validation process. 
Finally, all of the trees work successfully.  
4.3.2 Consistency 
To ensure the quality of CDTB, we adopt the 
inter-annotator consistency using Agreement 
and kappa on 60 documents (chtb0041-chtb 
2111
 0100). Table 1 illustrates the inter-annotator 
consistency in details. 
As shown in Table 1, we measure the agree-
ment of EDU segmentation by determining 
whether punctuation (all period, comma etc. are 
considered) is treated as an EDU boundary. It 
shows that the agreement reaches 91.7% with 
Cohen's kappa value (Cohen, 1960) 0.91. This 
justifies the appropriateness of our EDU defini-
tion. Explicit or Implicit agreement 94.7% is 
calculate by the same EDU boundary (intersec-
tion) of two annotators. For the same explicit 
relation, the connective identification agreement 
is 82.3%, because this is strict measure when 
two annotators choose the same connective word. 
If we relax the measure to contain the same 
word, the agreement can reach 98%. For exam-
ple, one annotate “?…?(also…and)”, and the 
other annotate “?(and)” is wrong with our strict 
measure.

77.4        -- 
Table 1: Inter-annotator consistency 
It is not surprising that the agreement on im-
plicit connective insertion with the same posi-
tion and the same connective only reaches 
74.6% since for some discourse relations, there 
may existing several connective alternatives. For 
example, both “so” and “therefore” can express 
the same causation relation. If we relax the con-
straint to the compatible connective, the agree-
ment on implicit connective insertion can reach 
up to 84.5%. 
Finally, it shows that the agreement on overall 
discourse structure (with the same connectives 
as non-leaf nodes, the same EDUs as leaf nodes) 
reaches 77.4%. This justifies the appropriateness 
of our CDT scheme, given the inherent ambigui-
ty in Chinese discourse structure. 
4.4 Corpus Statistics 
Currently, the CDTB corpus consists of 500 
newswire articles from Chinese Treebank, which 
are further divided into 2342 paragraphs with a 
CDT representation for one paragraph.  
? For EDUs, CDTB contains 10650 EDUs with 
an average of 4.5 EDUs per tree. On average, 
there are 2 EDUs per sentence and 22 Chi-
nese characters per EDU. 
? For discourse relations, CDTB contains 7310 
relations, of which 1812 are explicit relations 
(24.8%) and 5498 are implicit relations 
(75.2%). This indicates that implicit relations 
occur much more frequently in Chinese than 
in English, e.g. 75.2% in CDTB (Chinese) vs. 
~50% in PDTB (English). 
? With the deepest level of 9, most (98.5%) of 
discourse relations occur in level 1 (2342), 
level 2(2372), level 3(1532), level 4(712), 
and level 5(242). It also shows that 3557 
(48.7%) relations are mononuclear relations 
with 2110 nucleus ahead, while the remain-
ing 3754 relations are multi-nuclear. The 
numbers shown in the parentheses of Figure 
3 illustrate the distributions of different rela-
tions. In comparison with the top 2 most fre-
quently occurring relations in PDTB (Eng-
lish), i.e. the coordination and explanation re-
lations, there exist 3503 (47.9%) and 911 in-
stances respectively, with regard to the ab-
stract relation set as shown in Figure 3. 
? CDTB contains 282 connectives, among 
which 274 (140 can be deleted) appears as 
explicit connectives and 44 can be inserted in 
place of implicit connectives. Table 2 lists 
the top 10 frequent explicit connectives and 
implicit connectives.

6 Preliminary Experimentation 
In order to evaluate the computability of CDTB, 
we give the experimental results on EDU recog-
nition, which is crucial in discourse parsing. Af-
ter excluding sentence end punctuations (such as 
period, question mark, and exclamatory mark), 
which are certainly EDU boundaries, there re-
mains 7625 punctuations as EDU boundaries 
(positive instances) and 4876 punctuations as 
non-EDU boundaries (negative instances). With 
various features as adopted in Xue and Yang 
(2011) and Li et al. (2013b), Table 4 shows the 
performance of EDU recognition on the CDTB 
corpus with 10-fold cross validation.

NiveBayes 90.2    89.9   88.9 88.0    89.0    86.9 
Table 4: Performance of EDUs recognition 
As shown in Table 4, MaxEnt performs best, 
with accuracy up to 90.6% on gold standard 
parse tree, close to human agreement of 91.7%, 
and with accuracy up to 89% on automatic parse 
tree. This suggests the appropriateness of our 
definition of clause as EDU. Table 4 also gives 
the performance on both positive and negative 
instances. It shows better F1-measure on recog-
nizing positive instances than negative instances. 
7 Conclusions 
In this paper, we propose a Connective-driven 
Dependency Tree (CDT) structure as a represen-
tation scheme for Chinese discourse structure. 
CDT takes advantage of both RST and PDTB, 
and well adapts to the special characteristics of 
Chinese discourse. In particular, we describe 
CDT in detail from various perspectives, such as 
EDU, connective, structure, relation and nucle-
arity. Given the CDT scheme, we annotate 500 
documents in a top-down segmentation process 
to keep consistent with Chinese native’s cogni-
tive habit. Evaluation of the CDTB corpus on 
EDU recognition justifies the appropriateness of 
the CDT scheme to Chinese discourse structure 
and the usefulness of our CDTB corpus. 
In the future work, we will focus on enlarging 
the scale of the corpus annotation and develop-
ing a complete Chinese discourse parser.
