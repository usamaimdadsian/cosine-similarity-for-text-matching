Abstract
Readability is used to provide users with high-
quality service in text recommendation or text
visualization. With the increasing use of hand-
held devices, reading device is regarded as
an important factor for readability. There-
fore, this paper investigates the relationship
between readability and reading devices such
as a smart phone, a tablet, and paper. We sug-
gest readability factors that are strongly related
with the readability of a specific device by
showing the correlations between various fac-
tors in each device and human-rated readabil-
ity. Our experimental results show that each
device has its own readability characteristics,
and thus different weights should be imposed
on readability factors according to the device
type. In order to prove the usefulness of the
results, we apply the device-dependent read-
ability to news article recommendation.
1 Introduction
Readability is a function that maps a given text into a
readability score by considering “how easily the text is
read and understood” (Richards et al., 1992; Zamanian
and Heydari, 2012). Normally, the readability score is
formulated as a combination of various factors. These
factors reflect the easiness and understanding of the
text and include text presentation format, font size, av-
erage ratio of annotated images, and sentence length
(Hasegawa et al., 2008; Kitson, 1927; Ma et al., 2012;
¨
Oquist, 2006). Therefore, readability can be used to
provide satisfiable services in text recommendation or
text visualization.
The study on readability has begun in the education
field to measure the level of a text. With the success
of using readability in education (Franc¸ois and Fairon,
2012; Heilman et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2012), read-
ability has been used in a range of domains recently.
For example, in document retrieval, readability is used
to provide documents to non-expert users so that they
can read the retrieved documents easily (Jameel et al.,
2012; Yan et al., 2006). In text mining, readability has
been employed to analyze the characteristics of text.
Especially, Hillbom showed the differences in readabil-
ity between broadsheet newspapers and tabloids that
share a similar political stance (Hillbom, 2009).
There is one important issue of readability that has
not been studied in natural language processing. It is a
reading device. That is, previous studies focused only
on text printed on paper. However, with the increasing
use of hand-held devices, people in these days use var-
ious reading devices such as a tablet and a smart phone
as well as a paper. Readability score can be different
according to the device type, because each device has
its own idiosyncrasy. For example, assume that a sys-
tem recommends the same news article to both user A
who reads it in her smart phone and user B who reads
it on paper. Although both users read the same article,
user A might believe that her article is more difficult to
read than user B because of the screen size of her smart
phone.
This paper explores the relationship between reading
devices and readability. For this purpose, we first inves-
tigate whether readability changes according to device
type or not. Then, we analyze which readability fac-
tors are affected by reading devices. To see the rela-
tionship between readability factors and devices, var-
ious well-known readability factors are computed for
news articles collected from an Internet portal. At the
same time, the readability of each article is also man-
ually rated. When the readability is rated manually, it
is done three times for different reading devices of a
smart phone, a tablet, and paper. The factors that af-
fect the readability actually in each device are found
out through the correlations between the factors and the
manually-labeled readability. Some factors are impor-
tant to the readability of smart phone, but insignificant
to that of paper. Therefore, we discover the importance
of each readability factor for each device by analyzing
the correlations.
The usefulness of the device-dependent readability
is proven by applying it to news article recommenda-
tion. That is, different importance weights for read-
ability factors are considered according to device type
when recommending news articles. Our experimental
results show that the performance of news article rec-
ommendation gets best when the device used for read-
ing news articles is identical to the device used for mea-
suring readability. Therefore, it is essential to consider
different importance weights according to device type
1396
in news article recommendation. It also proves that
the proposed device-dependent readability reflects the
characteristics of reading devices well.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We
first review related studies on readability. Next, we
introduce various readability factors and propose the
device-dependent readability. Then, the news article
recommendation using the device-dependent readabil-
ity is explained. This recommendation is prepared to
prove the usefulness of the device-dependent readabil-
ity. In the experiments, we present the experimental
results on the relationship between reading devices and
readability. We also describe the experiments on news
recommendation using the device-dependent readabil-
ity and present their results. Finally, we summarize our
research.
2 Related work
The history of readability studies began in the 1800s.
Early studies focused on the frequency of easy words,
sentence length, and word length (Huld´en, 2004).
Flesch designed a formula to calculate “reading ease”
using only the average word length and sentence length
(Flesch, 1948). He adjusted the relative importance
between word length and sentence length using 100
words selected randomly from a corpus. This formula
is called the Flesch-Kincaid formula, and is generally
used in measuring the readability of a textbook (Kin-
caid et al., 1975). Dale and Chall (1949) defined a list
of 3,000 easy words. Then, they used the average sen-
tence length and the percentage of words not included
in the list. These studies simply used superficial fac-
tors, and thus do not reflect syntactic factors.
Recent studies on readability use various factors in-
cluding syntactic ones, and combine them to produce
a highly predictive model of readability. Franc¸ois and
Faircon (2012) proposed a readability formula with 46
textual factors for French as a foreign language. The
factors represent lexical, syntactic, and semantic char-
acteristics of sentences, and the specificities of French.
They are extracted from 28 French Foreign Language
(FFL) textbooks written for adults learning FFL. On the
other hand, Pitler and Nenkova (2008) showed the rela-
tion between readability factors and readability. They
used human ratings from the Wall Street Journal cor-
pus, and computed the correlations between the read-
ability factors and the average human ratings. Accord-
ing to their results, the average number of verb phrases
in a sentence, the number of words in an article, the
likelihood of the vocabulary, and the likelihood of the
discourse relations are highly correlated with human
ratings. However, these studies did not consider the
reading devices, but focused on how well a text is writ-
ten. Since the readability can be differentiated accord-
ing to reading device, a reading device should be con-
sidered when computing the readability of a given text.
To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies
on the readability on mobile devices that do not con-
sider language-related aspects. Most studies on mobile
devices focused on the development of new text format
and layout to help users read documents easily.
¨
Oquist
(2006) proposed a new text presentation format called
the dynamic Rapid Serial Visual Presentation. Accord-
ing to his experimental results, this format helps to re-
duce eye movements. On the other hand, Hasegawa
et al. (2008) evaluated the readability of documents
on mobile devices with regard to screen and font size.
They reported that the readability is improved when the
characters are vertically enlarged. Readability on mo-
bile devices is not reflected only by the visualization
factors, but also by textual factors. Therefore, this pa-
per explores the readability factors that reflect the lexi-
cal and grammatical complexity of text and are affected
by reading devices.
3 Readability Factors
Table 1 lists the readability factors used in this paper.
Basically, they are based on the factors proposed by
Pitler and Nenkova (2008). However, some factors are
excluded and some new factors are added. This is be-
cause some of their factors are computationally infeasi-
ble and language-dependent. As a result, we have thir-
teen readability factors. These readability factors are
divided into four types: superficial, lexical, syntactic
factors, and lexical cohesion.
3.1 Superficial Factors
Superficial factors were used in most early readability
studies (Dale and Chall, 1949; Flesch, 1948; Kincaid et
al., 1975), and reflect the construction of a text. We in-
vestigate four factors: text length (TL), sentence length
(SL), average number of words per sentence (WS), and
average number of characters per word (CW). Since
longer text is perceived as “harder-to-read” than short
one, these factors are all reciprocally related with read-
ability.
The first two factors are related to length. TL counts
the number of characters in a text, whereas SL com-
putes the number of sentences. When a writer attempts
to write many topics in a text, she tends to use many
kinds of words simultaneously. As a result, the text be-
comes longer and more complex. Such long length of
text disturbs a reader’s comprehension of the text, and
then it is more difficult for the reader to read the text
(Heilman et al., 2008).
WS counts the average number of words per sen-
tence, and CW reflects the average number of characters
per word. When they are large, the sentence is diffi-
cult to read, which leads to difficulties in understanding
the text. Especially, CW reflects compound nouns and
technical words. For instance, compound nouns in Ko-
rean are usually long, because there is no spacing be-
tween words in a compound noun. For example, let us
consider a compound noun, “Daehanmingukjungboo,”
which means the Korean government. Actually this
compound noun consists of two independent nouns.
1397
Type of Factors Abbr. Description
Superficial factors
TL The number of characters in a text
SL The number of sentences in a text
WS Average number of words per sentence
CW Average number of characters per word
Lexical factor LL Article likelihood estimated by language model
Syntactic factors
PTD Average parse tree depths per sentence
NP Average number of noun phrases per sentence
VP Average number of verb phrases per sentence
SBAR Average number of subordinate clauses per sentence
Lexical cohesion
COS Average cosine similarity between pairs of adjacent sentences
WO Average word overlap between pairs of adjacent sentences
NPO Average word overlap over noun and pronoun only
PRP Average number of pronouns per sentence
Table 1: Description of readability factors
One is “Daehanminguk” meaning Korea and the other
is “Jungboo” meaning a government. The two are con-
catenated to form a compound noun and become a long
single word. In addition, many difficult words such as
domain-specific terms tend to be long. Such lengthy
words make it difficult to read a text.
3.2 Lexical Factor
Lexical factor determines whether a given text con-
sists of frequent words. Texts that express a new trend
in various fields often use many newly coined words.
Such neologisms make it difficult to read and under-
stand a text. Therefore, an easily-understandable text
is composed of widely-used words rather than unusual
words.
In order to compute the use of frequent words in a
text, a unigram language model is used as in the work
of Pitler and Nenkova (2008). In this model, the log
likelihood of text t is computed by
?
w?t
C(w) · logP (w|B). (1)
where P (w|B) is the probability of a word w according
to a background corpus B, and C(w) is the number of
times that w appears in t.
This factor examines the familiarity of the words
used in the text. The more frequently a word appears
in the background corpus, the more familiar it is re-
garded. The frequency of a word w is then reflected
into P (w|B) computed from the independent back-
ground corpus B. Therefore, the factor LL is positively
related with readability.
3.3 Syntactic Factors
Syntactic factors reflect sentence complexity directly
that affects human processing of a sentence. We con-
sider the average parse tree depth per sentence (PTD),
the average number of noun phrases per sentence (NP),
the average number of verb phrases per sentence (VP),
and the average number of subordinate clauses per sen-
tence (SBAR) as syntactic factors. These four factors
were defined by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005).
A reader regards a text as difficult when the sen-
tences in the text have large parse tree depths or many
subordinate clauses. Thus, PTD and SBAR are related
negatively with readability. On the other hand, the re-
lationship of NP and VP to readability are not one way.
The large number of noun phrases in a text requires
a reader to remember more items (Barzilay and Lap-
ata, 2008; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008). However, it also
makes the text more interesting. The texts written for
adults actually contain more entities than those writ-
ten for children (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008). The same
is true for VP. The large number of verb phrases in a
sentence makes the sentence more complex. However,
people feel that a text is more easier to comprehend
when related clauses are grouped together (Bailin and
Grafstein, 2001).
3.4 Lexical Cohesion
Lexical cohesion denotes how the sentences in a text
are semantically connected. People usually bring con-
tinuous sentences into their mind at the same time, and
interpret them as a single unit (Okazaki et al., 2005). In
other words, a reader prefers text whose sentences are
smoothly connected to text whose sentences are inde-
pendent of one another. Therefore, sentence continuity
plays a primary role in understanding an entire text.
In the classic study of cohesion, various uses of
cohesive elements such as pronouns, definite articles,
and topic continuity have been discussed (Halliday and
Hasan, 1976). This paper uses the average cosine sim-
ilarity (COS), word overlap (WO), word overlap over
just nouns and pronouns (NPO) between pairs of adja-
cent sentences, and the average number of pronouns per
sentence (PRP). COS, WO, and NPO are superficial mea-
sures of topic continuity, whereas PRP is an indicative
feature of sentence continuity. High values for these
factors imply that the sentences in the text are related
somehow. Therefore, these factors are believed to be
related positively with readability.
1398
3.5 Measurement of Readability
When a reading device d is given, the readability of
text t, represented as R(t|d), is formulated as a com-
bination of readability factors with their corresponding
weight in the device. We assume that w
i|d
, the weight
of a readability factor f
i
, is dependent on the reading
device d. Following the previous work of Pitler and
Nenkova (2008), we also assume that each readabil-
ity factor affects readability independently. Therefore,
readability is calculated as a weighted linear sum of all
readability factors. That is, R(t|d) is computed by
R(t|d) =
?
i?{1,2,...,M}
w
i|d
· f
i
(t) (2)
where M is the number of readability factors.
Each weight w
i|d
is determined from a set of news
articles T . We collected a large number of news arti-
cles from an Internet news portal. The readability of
each article was manually labeled. This is done three
times, since we have three different devices of a smart
phone, a tablet, and paper. Since human rating of each
article t ? T is available for each device, w
i|d
’s can
be estimated by linear regression. These weights are
different according to the devices.
4 News Article Recommendation by
Device-Dependent Readability
The fact that the weights w
i|d
in Equation (2) are differ-
ent for each device d implies that the readability mea-
surement should be different depending on the device
type. In order to see the usefulness of this device-
dependent readability, we apply it to news article rec-
ommendation. News article recommendation aims to
provide a user with news articles that interest the user.
Thus, it selects a few articles that meet user preference
from a gigantic amount of news events. Various meth-
ods have reported notable results in news article rec-
ommendation (Das et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Liu et
al., 2010). In addition, with the recent interest in hand-
held devices, the demand for news recommendation on
hand-held devices is increasing. However, there has
been, at least as far as we know, no study on the read-
ability of hand-held devices.
Device-dependent readability is reflected into news
article recommendation through a re-ranking frame-
work. Figure 1 depicts the overall process of suggest-
ing news articles for a specific device with the device-
dependent readability. The point of this figure is to
measure how appropriate a news article is for a spe-
cific reading device. For this, a news recommendation
system first chooses a set of news articles from a news
repository based on its own criterion. Then, we re-rank
them by the device-dependent readability to obtain the
final set of ranked news articles for the device.
Formally, a news article recommendation ranks a set
of articles, A = {a
1
, a
2
, ..., a
m
}, where a
i
represents
the i-th article. The order between ranks a

Table 2: Statistics of the news article data

should be satisfied by the criterion of the
recommendation system. That is, assuming that the
system has a score function score(a

score(a

) has to be met if a

. Then, the top
k(k ? m) articles of A by the score function are sug-
gested as appropriate news articles. After that, the se-
lected articles are re-ranked by another criterion, the
device-dependent readability. That is, the final rank of
an article within the selected set is determined by an-
other function, rerank. Since this function has to re-
flect the device-dependent readability, it takes two pa-
rameters. One is an article, and the other is a device
type. The re-rank function is modeled as
rerank(a, d) = R(a|d)
=
?
i?{1,2,...,M}
w
i|d
· f
i
(a). (3)
As a result, the readability-based re-ranking module
suggests the news articles based on how easily the ar-
ticles are read on a specific reading device. Note that
even the same article would be ranked differently ac-
cording to the device type because the article is re-
ranked by the device-dependent readability. At last, the
top k
?
(k
?
? k) re-ranked articles among them are sug-
gested as final news articles.
5 Experiments
5.1 Experiments on Readability Factors
5.1.1 Experiment Settings
For the experiments of analyzing relationship between
readability factors and readability, we collected a Ko-
rean news corpus from Naver News
1
. This corpus con-
tains news articles from June 10, 2013 to June 25,
2013. We selected 74 articles randomly from the cor-
pus which were used for readability formula and show-
ing the relationships between readability factors. All
selected articles belong to one of three categories: ‘Pol-
itics’, ‘Entertainment’, and ‘Sports’. A set of these 74
news articles becomes T , and is used to compute the
weights in Equation (2). Table 2 describes a simple
statistics of the selected news articles. The shortest ar-
ticle consists of 68 characters, whereas the longest one
has 610 characters. The average length of article is
346.5. The shortest article is written in one sentence,
and the longest has 14 sentences. One article has ap-
proximately 6.24 sentences on average. In addition, the

Figure 1: Overall process of re-ranking news articles based on device-dependent readability
number of words per sentence ranges from 8 to 33, and
the average is 16.93. The minimum number of words
in an article is 17, and the maximum number of words
is 178. An article is composed of 99.34 words on aver-
age.
In order to compute the lexical factor LL by Equa-
tion (1), a background corpus B is required. Since this
corpus should be independent from the news articles
explained above, the Naver News is adopted again to
generate B. For the background corpus B, we col-
lected news articles from January 1, 2013 to September
6, 2013, but excluded the articles from June 10 to June
25, because they are already used. This corpus consists
of 298,729 articles with 3,264,104 distinct words.
The readability score for each article was manually
labeled by three undergraduate students. To investigate
the relationship between reading devices and readabil-
ity, each article was read using three different reading
devices. The Galaxy Note 1 with a 5-inch screen is
used as the smart phone, Galaxy Tab 10.1 with a 10.1-
inch screen is used as the tablet, and A4-size paper
is used for the paper. That is, the human annotators
read and rated 74 articles per device. The order of the
devices where the annotators evaluated readability is
smart phone, tablet, and paper. This order was main-
tained for all the experiments. All aspects but content
texts were under control. For instance, font = “Gothic,
12 pt” (this is most commonly used font and size that
most Korean web pages and textbooks use), font color
= “black”, alignment = “both” were used for all three
devices. In addition, the non-content aspects were ex-
actly same for devices because the annotators of read-
ability and the recommended articles shared the read-
ing devices. Although these aspects affect readability
and many previous studies already proved it, it is not
our concern. We only attempt to capture how read-

ability is affected by the content in different types of
devices.
Human annotators can remember the content of
news articles when they read articles with three de-
vices. The human annotators were asked to read and
evaluate many articles within a relatively short period.
Therefore, before the main experiments, we performed
a pilot experiment on the memory effects of previously
read articles and verified it empirically. We hired three
undergraduate students who were not involved in our
main experiments. The students read the same 250 ar-
ticles four times, and these also come from Naver News
corpus which are not included the previous 74 articles.
After their first reading, they read the articles again in
3, 7, and 14 days later. After 3 days, two students re-
membered the articles somewhat, but one student re-
membered them vaguely. Since they almost forgot the
articles after 7 days, we placed 7 days interval between
devices.
The readability score of an article was rated by the
annotators using the questions in the work of Pitler and
Nenkova (2008). We use only two of the questions,
while they used four questions for the annotators. Their
questions are intended to measure the extent of how
well a text is written, how it fits together, how easy
it is to understand, and how interesting it is. We can
consider “well-written” and “fit-together” as a syntac-
tic perspective, whereas “easy to understand” and “in-
teresting” belong to a content perspective. For such a

reason, four questions can be summarized in two ques-
tions. The two questions used are
• How well-written is this article?
• How interesting is this article?
For these two questions, each annotator assigns a score
between 1 and 5 to each article. Here, 1 point means
that the article is worst and 5 point implies that it is
best. A readability score of one human annotator is
composed with the average of two questions (well-
written, interesting). We used the average of three hu-
man annotators’ readability scores in our experiments.
Table 3 shows the readability scores of the articles for
each device. According to this table, the readability
score ranges from 1.67 to 5 for the smart phone, 1.33
to 5 for the tablet, and ranges from 2 to 5 for the paper.
The average readability is 3.423 for the smart phone,
3.531 for the tablet, and 3.360 for the paper. To see
the inter-judge agreement among annotators, the Kappa
coefficient (Fleiss, 1971) is used. The Kappa values
for the ‘smart phone’, ‘tablet’, and ‘paper’ are 0.342,
0.333, and 0.361, respectively. All these values corre-
spond to fair agreement.
5.1.2 Experimental Results
In order to see the importance of each factor in a spe-
cific device, we adopt the Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients between readability factors and reading devices.
Table 4 lists the four most important factors in each
device and their Pearson correlation coefficients. Espe-
cially, p-value is smaller than 0.05 for all factors in this
table.
For the smart phone, SL, the number of sentences in
a text, is the most important readability factor. Its cor-
relation with the smart phone is -0.394. TL, the number
of characters, is the second important factor and has a
negative correlation of -0.293. These results imply that
readers are negatively sensitive to the length of an arti-
cle because of the small display size of a smart phone.
That is, in the smart phone, longer articles are recog-
nized as difficult to read compared to shorter ones. The
number of words per sentence, WS, is the third impor-
tant factor with correlation of 0.288. The log-likelihood
of an article, LL, is also positively related with the read-
ability, which proves that widely-used words make it
easy to understand an article. The top three factors are
superficial with regard to text length. Therefore, the su-
perficial factors are more important than other types of
factors for the smart phone.
SL is the most critical readability factor even for the
tablet. It affects readability with high correlation of -
0.370. The second important factor is WS with correla-
tion of 0.321. Both of these factors are superfical. The
third important factor, LL, is positively related with
readability as expected. The fourth factor that affects
readability is the number of noun phrases, NP. It is nat-
ural for NP to be positively related with the readability.
Finally, for the paper, NP is most strongly related to
readability with correlation of 0.298. The second im-
portant factor is WS, whose correlation is 0.278. LL is
the third important factor and shows a positive relation-
ship. Note that WS and LL are important readability
factors for all devices. The next important readabil-
ity factor for the paper is the average number of verb
phrases (VP). The articles with many noun phrases and
verb phrases are perceived as easier-to-read for the pa-
per. Note that the importance of superficial factors is
limited for the paper. We expected that WS is negatively
related, but, it is positively related with readability for
all three devices. The reason for this could be that the
annotators thought the articles with higher WS are more
interesting.
The important factors for the smart phone are differ-
ent from those for the paper. On the other hand, the
tablet shares many factors with both the smart phone
and the paper. Because the screen size of a tablet is
similar to the size of an A4 paper, the tablet and the pa-
per share readability factors. However, length-related
factors play a more important role than syntactic fac-
tors in the smart phone because a smart phone has a
smaller screen.
5.2 Experiments on News Recommendation
5.2.1 Experiment Settings
Experiments for news article recommendation were
performed to see the effectiveness of device-dependent
readability. The process of news recommendation with
device-dependent readability is as follows. For a spe-
cific device,
1. Select top-k news articles from a news repository
by the criterion of the recommendation system.
2. Re-rank the k articles by the readability of the de-
vice using Equation (3).
3. Select top-k
?
news articles by the new rank.
4. Human annotators read and rate the k
?
articles
with the device.
5. Compare the ranks of k
?
articles by device-
dependent readability with those by human rat-
ings.
Since we have three types of devices, this process is
performed three times with a different device.
The news articles from September 10, 2013 to
September 12, 2013 collected from Naver News were
1401
Min Max Average
Article length 277 6,077 990.68
# of sentences 4 199 22.85
# of words per sentence 4 100 15.73
# of words per article 71 2,034 301.61

Paper 1 5 3.250 ± 0.907
Table 6: Scores of news articles by human annotators
in news recommendation
used as the news repository. The number of times that
a news article was actually read by its anonymous read-
ers at the portal site is used as the criterion for the rec-
ommendation system. Since this criterion is provided
on a daily basis and news articles were collected for
three days, the process explained above is performed
three times. The top twenty articles were selected by
the criterion every day. That is, k = 20. Table 5 shows
the statistics of the total 60 articles. The shortest arti-
cle consists of 277 characters, and the longest article
has 6,077 characters. On average, an article is writ-
ten with 990.68 characters. The minimum number of
sentences in an article is 4, and the maximum number
of sentences is 199. An article is composed of 22.85
sentences on average. The average number of words in
a sentence is 15.73, whereas a sentence length ranges
from 4 to 100 words. The shortest article has 71 words,
and the longest article has 2,034 words. One article has
approximately 301.61 words on average.
Three human annotators labeled the scores of the
news articles manually. The annotators were the same
persons who labeled the readability scores. Similar to
the previous experiments, 7 days intervals was placed
among devices to reduce the memory effect. The same
two questions used in the previous section were used
again for this experiment. The annotators assigned a
score between 1 and 5 to every article for each ques-
tion. The final score of an article was obtained by aver-
aging six scores (two questions from three annotators).
Table 6 summarizes the scores of the articles by the
human annotators. As shown in this table, the article
scores vary for all reading devices. The average scores
for smart phone, tablet, and paper are 3.513, 3.344,
and 3.250 respectively. The Kappa value for the ‘smart
phone’ is 0.402, and that for both the ‘tablet’ and the
‘paper’ is 0.393. Thus, the value of ‘smart phone’ falls
into moderate agreement, whereas those of the ‘tablet’
and ‘paper’ correspond to fair agreement. The perfor-
mance of the news article recommendation is evaluated
with the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at
top P (NDCG@P ) (J¨arvelin and Kek¨al¨ainen, 2002).

5.2.2 Experimental Results
For the a baseline criterion, we use the news article
recommendation system in Naver, which recommends
news article by the number of article hits. Figures 2 to 4
show the NDCG@k
?
scores with 1 ? k
?
? 10 for the
three devices. Each graph in these figures compares the
performance of various devices when the readability
for a specific device is used. That is, Figure 2 depicts
the NDCG@k
?
scores for the recommended news arti-
cles when the articles are shown in the smart phone, the
tablet, and the paper respectively. In computing their
NDCG@k
?
scores, the news articles are re-ranked by
readability for the smart phone. Therefore, in this fig-
ure we expect that the NDCG@k
?
score for using the
smart phone is higher than those for using the tablet and
paper. In the same way, Figure 3 and Figure 4 compare
the NDCG@k
?
scores when the readabilities for the
tablet and paper are used.
In all three graphs, the best news recommendation
performance is achieved when the device used to read
1402
Figure 4: NDCG@k
?
scores with various k
?
for the

news articles is the same as the device used for read-
ability. In Figure 2, the use of the smart phone outper-
forms those of other devices when k
?
? 6. This proves
that the quality of highly ranked news articles is much
better for the smart phone than for other devices, when
the readability for smart phone is used.
Figure 3 shows the NDCG@k
?
scores for using var-
ious devices when the news articles are re-ranked by
readability for the tablet. In this figure, the use of
the tablet as a reading device is better than using the
smart phone or the paper. The performance difference
is largest at k
?
= 3. The difference becomes smaller
as k
?
increases up to 10, but the performance of tablet
is still higher than those of others. In Figure 2 and 3,
when k
?
= 1, the baseline outperforms other devices.
We believe this happens because the baseline chooses
news articles by user-hit. Therefore, many articles rec-
ommended by the baseline are interesting because peo-
ple tend to click more often when an article is inter-
esting. As noted, readability reflects users’ interests,
which leads to high performance of the baseline. The
performance of paper is best in Figure 4, since the ar-
ticles are re-ranked by the readability for paper. Paper
outperforms all other devices for all k
?
s. Note that the
performances of the baseline are always lowest regard-
less of reading device.
From all results above, we can infer that the use of
device-dependent readability is helpful to news article
recommendation. This is because the readability fac-
tors that affect the readers of news articles are different
according to the reading device. Therefore, it is im-
portant to reflect the characteristics of a reading device
when recommending news articles.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a device-dependent
readability. Since a reading device is one of the most
important features of readability, different weights have
been assigned to the readability factors according to de-
vice type. We have shown that the important readabil-
ity factors are distinct according to the reading device
by investigating the correlation between the readability
factors and the reading device. Through the correlation,
we found that tablet shares many important factors with
both smart phone and paper.
The experiments on the news articles collected from
an Internet portal proved that readability is actually af-
fected by the reading device. In addition, the validity of
the device-dependent readability was shown by apply-
ing it to the news article recommendation. The news
articles were first ranked by the criterion of the recom-
mendation system. Then, they were re-ranked by the
device-dependent readability. Our experiments showed
that the recommendation performance of the re-ranked
articles gets best when the device used for readability is
the same as the reading device. These two types of ex-
periments proved the importance and effectiveness of
the device-dependent readability.
