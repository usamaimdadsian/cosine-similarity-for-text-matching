Abstract 
Lexicon definition is one of the main bot- 
tlenecks in the development of new ap- 
plications in the field of Information Ex- 
traction from text. Generic resources 
(e.g., lexical databases) are promising for 
reducing the cost of specific lexica defi- 
nition, but they introduce lexical ambi- 
guity. This paper proposes a methodol- 
ogy for building application-specific lex- 
ica by using WordNet. Lexical ambiguity 
is kept under control by marking synsets 
in WordNet with field labels taken from 
the Dewey Decimal Classification. 
1 Introduction 
One of the current issues in Information Extrac- 
tion (IE) is efficient transportability, as the cost 
of new applications is one of the factors limiting 
the market. The lexicon definition process is cur- 
rently one of the main bottlenecks in producing 
applications. As a matter of fact the necessary lex- 
icon for an average application is generally large 
(hundreds to thousands of words) and most lexical 
information is not transportable across domains. 
The problem of lexicon transport is worsened by 
the growing degree of lexicalization of IE systems: 
nowadays everal successful systems adopt lexical 
rules at many levels. 
The IE research mainstream focused essentially 
on the definition of lexica starting from a corpus 
sample (Riloff, 1993; Grishman, 1997) with the 
implicit assumption that a corpus provided for an 
application is representative of the whole applica-

tion requirement. Unfortunately one of the cur- 
rent trends in IE is the progressive reduction of 
the size of training corpora: e.g., from the 1,000 
texts of the MUC-5 (MUC-5, 1993) to the 100 
texts in MUC-6 (MUC-6, 1995). When the cor- 
pus size is limited, the assumption of lexical rep- 
resentativeness of the sample corpus may not hold 
any longer, and the problem of producing a repre- 
sentative lexicon starting from the corpus lexicon 
arises (Grishman, 1995). 
Generic resources are interesting as they con- 
tain (among others) most of the terms necessary 
for an IE application. Nevertheless up to now 
the use of generic resources within IE system has 
been limited for two main reasons. First the in- 
formation associated to each term is often not de- 
tailed enough for describing the relations neces- 
sary for a IE lexicon; secondly the presence of a 
large amount of lexical polysemy. 
In this paper we propose a methodology for 
semi-automatically developing the relevant part of 
a lexicon (foreground lexicon) for IE applications 
by using both a small corpus and WordNet. 
2 Developing IE Lexical Resources 
Lexical information in IE can be divided into three 
sources of information (Kilgarriff, 1997): 
• an ontology, i.e. the templates to be filled; 
• the foreground lexicon (FL), i.e. the terms 
tightly bound to the ontology; 
• the background lexicon (BL), i.e. the terms 
not related or loosely related to the ontology. 
In this paper we focus on FL only. 
The FL has generally a limited size with re- 
spect to the average dictionary of a language; its 
dimension depends on each application eeds, but 
it is generally limited to some hundreds of words. 
The level of quantitative and qualitative informa- 
tion for each entry in the FL can be very high 
and it is not transportable across domains and

applications, as it contains the mapping between 
the entries and the ontology. Generic dictionaries 
can contribute in identifying entries for the FL, 
but generally do not provide useful information 
for the mapping with the ontology. This map- 
ping between words and ontology is generally to 
be built by hand. Most of the time in transport- 
ing the lexicon is spent in identifying and build- 
ing FLs. Efficiently building FLs for applications 
means building the right FL (or at least a reason- 
able approximation of it) in a short time. The 
right FL contains those words that are necessary 
for the application and only those. The presence 
of all the relevant terms should guarantee that the 
information in the text is never lost; inserting just 
the relevant terms allows to limit the development 
effort, and should guarantee the system from noise 
caused by spurious entries in the lexicon. 
The BL could be seen as the complementary set 
of the FL with respect to the generic language, 
i.e. it contains all the words of the language that 
do not belong to the FL. In general the quantity 
of application specific information is small. Any 
machine readable dictionary can be to some ex- 
tent seen as a BL. The transport of BL to new 
applications i not a problem, therefore it will not 
be considered in this paper. 
2.1 Using Generic Lexical Resources 
We propose a development methodology for FLs 
based on two steps: 
• Bootstrapping: manual or semi-automatic 
identification from the corpus of an initial lex- 
icon (Core Lexicon), i.e. of the lexicon cover- 
ing the corpus sample. 
• Consolidation: extension of the Core Lexi- 
con by using a generic dictionary in order to 
completely cover the lexicon needed by the 
application but not exhaustively represented 
in the corpus sample. 
We propose to use WordNet (Miller, 1990) as a 
generic dictionary during the consolidation phase 
because it can be profitably used for integrating 
the Core Lexicon by adding for each term in a 
semi-automatic way: 
• its synonyms; 
• hyponyms and (maybe) hypernyms; 
• some coordinated terms. 
As mentioned, there are two problems related 
to the use of generic dictionaries with respect o 
the IE needs. 
First there is no clear way of extracting from 
them the mapping between the FL and the ontol- 
ogy; this is mainly due to a lack of information and 
cannot in general be solved; generic lexica cannot 
then be used during the bootstrapping phase to 
generate the Core Lexicon. 
Secondly experience showed that the lexical am- 
biguity carried by generic dictionaries does not 
allow their direct use in computational systems 
(Basili and Pazienza, 1997; Morgan et al., 1995). 
Even when they are used off-line, lexical ambigu- 
ity can introduce so much noise (and then over- 
head) in the lexical development process that their 
use can be inconvenient from the point of view of 
efficiency and effectiveness. 
The next section explains how it is possible 
to cope with lexical ambiguity in WordNet by 
combining its information with another source of 
information: the Dewey Decimal Classification 
(DDC) (Dewey, 1989). 
3 Reducing the lexical ambiguity 
in WordNet  
The main problem with the use of WordNet is lex- 
ical polysemy 1. Lexical polysemy is present when 
a word is associated to many senses (synsets). In 
general it is not easy to discriminate between dif- 
ferent synsets. It is then necessary to find a way 
for helping the lexicon developer in selecting the 
correct synset for a word. 
In order to cope with lexical polysemy, we pro- 
pose to integrate WordNet synsets with an addi- 
tional information: a set of field labels. Field la- 
bels are indicators, generally used in dictionaries, 
which provide information about the use of the 
word in a semantic field. Semantic fields are sets 
of words tied together by "similarity" covering the 
most part of the lexical area of a specific domain. 
Marking synsets with field labels has a clear ad- 
vantage: in general, given a polysemous word in 
WordNet and a particular field label, in most of 
the cases the word is disambiguated. For example 
Security is polysemous as it belongs to 9 different 
synsets; only the second one is related to the eco- 
nomic domain. If we mark this synset with the 
field label Economy, it is possible to disambiguate 
the term Security when analyzing texts in an eco- 
nomic context. Note that WordNet being a hier- 
archy, marking a synset with a field label means 
also marking all its sub-hierarchy with such field 
label. In the Security example, if we mark the sec- 
ond synset with the field label Economy we also 
associate the same field label to the synonym Cer- 
tificate, to the 13 direct hyponyms and to the 27 
1 Actually the problem is related to both polysemy 
and omonymy. As WordNet does not distinguish be- 
tween them, we will use the term polysemy for refer- 
ring to both.

indirect ones; moreover we can also inspect its co- 
ordinated terms and assign the same label to 9 of 
the 33 coordinate terms (and then to their direct 
and indirect hyponyms). Marking is equivalent to 
assigning WordNet synsets to sets each of them 
referring to a particular semantic field. Marking 
the structure allows us to solve the problem of 
choosing which synsets are relevant for the do- 
main. Associating a domain (e.g., finance) to one 
or more field labels should allow us to determine 
in principle the synsets relevant for the domain. 
It is possible to greatly reduce the ambiguity im- 
plied by the use of WordNet by finding the correct 
set of field labels that cover all the WordNet hier- 
archy in an uniform way. Therefore we can reduce 
the overhead in building the FL using WordNet. 
Our assumption is that using semantic fields 
taken from the DDC 2 , all the possible domains 
can then be covered. This is because the first ten 
classes of the DDC (an extract is shown in fig- 
ure 1) exhaust he traditional academic disciplines 
and so they also cover the generic knowledge of the 
world. The integration consists in marking parts 
of WordNet's hierarchy, i.e. some synsets, with 
semantic labels taken from the DDC. 
4 The  deve lopment  cyc le  us ing  
WN-PDDC 
The consolidation phase mentioned in section 2.1 
can be integrated with the use of the WN+DDC

widely used library classification system in the world; 
at the broadest level, it classifies concepts into ten 
main classes, which cover the entire world of knowl- 
edge. 
as generic resource (see figure 2). Before starting 
the development, the set of field labels relevant for 
the application must be identified. Then the Core 
Lexicon is identified in the usual way. 
Using WN+DDC it is possible for each term in 
the Core Lexicon to: 
• identify the synsets the term belongs to; am- 
biguities are reduced by applying the inter- 
section of the field labels chosen for the cur- 
rent application and those associated to the 
possible synsets. 
• integrate the Core Lexicon by adding, for 
each term: synonyms in the synsets, hy- 
ponyms and (maybe) hypernyms and some 
coordinated terms. 
The proposed methodology is corpus centered 
(starting from the corpus analysis to build the 
Core Lexicon) and can always be profitably ap- 
plied. It also provides a criterion for building lex- 
ical resources for specific domains. It can be ap- 
plied in a semiautomatic way. It has the advan- 
tage of using the information contained in Word- 
Net for expanding the FL beyond the corpus lim- 
itations, keeping under control the ambiguity im- 
plied by the use of a generic resource. 
5 Conc lus ion  
Up to now experiments have been carried on in 
the financial domain, and in particular in the do- 
main of bonds issued by banks. Experiments are 
continuing. The construction of WN+DDC is a 
long process that has to be done in general. Up 
to now we have just started inserting in WordNet 
the field labels that are interesting for the domain

under analysis. If the final experiments will con- 
firm the usefulness of the approach, we will extend 
the integration to the rest of the WordNet hierar- 
chy. The final evaluation will include a compari- 
son of the lexicon produced by using WN+DDC 
with a normally developed lexicon in the domain 
of bond-issue (Ciravegna et el., 1999). The eval- 
uation will consider both quality and quantity of 
terms and development time of the whole lexicon. 
One of the issues that we are currently investi- 
gating is that of choosing the correct set of field 
labels from DDC: DDC is very detailed and it is 
not worth integrating it completely with Word- 
Net. It is necessary to individuate the correct set 
of labels by pruning the DDC hierarchy at some 
level. We are currently investigating the effective- 
ness of just selecting the first three levels of the 
hierarchy.
