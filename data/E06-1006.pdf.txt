Abstract
We propose a backoff model for phrase-
based machine translation that translates
unseen word forms in foreign-language
text by hierarchical morphological ab-
stractions at the word and the phrase level.
The model is evaluated on the Europarl
corpus for German-English and Finnish-
English translation and shows improve-
ments over state-of-the-art phrase-based
models.
1 Introduction
Current statistical machine translation (SMT) usu-
ally works well in cases where the domain is
fixed, the training and test data match, and a large
amount of training data is available. Nevertheless,
standard SMT models tend to perform much bet-
ter on languages that are morphologically simple,
whereas highly inflected languages with a large
number of potential word forms are more prob-
lematic, particularly when training data is sparse.
SMT attempts to find a sentence eˆ in the desired
output language given the corresponding sentence
f in the source language, according to
eˆ = argmaxeP (f |e)P (e) (1)
Most state-of-the-art SMT adopt a phrase-based
approach such that e is chunked into I phrases
e¯1, ..., e¯I and the translation model is defined
over mappings between phrases in e and in f .
i.e. P (f¯ |e¯). Typically, phrases are extracted from
a word-aligned training corpus. Different inflected
forms of the same lemma are treated as different
words, and there is no provision for unseen forms,
i.e. unknown words encountered in the test data
are not translated at all but appear verbatim in the
output. Although the percentage of such unseen
word forms may be negligible when the training
set is large and matches the test set well, it may rise
drastically when training data is limited or from
a different domain. Many current and future ap-
plications of machine translation require the rapid
porting of existing systems to new languages and
domains without being able to collect appropri-
ate training data; this problem can therefore be
expected to become increasingly more important.
Furthermore, untranslated words can be one of the
main factors contributing to low user satisfaction
in practical applications.
Several previous studies (see Section 2 below)
have addressed issues of morphology in SMT, but
most of these have focused on the problem of word
alignment and vocabulary size reduction. Princi-
pled ways of incorporating different levels of mor-
phological abstraction into phrase-based models
have mostly been ignored so far. In this paper we
propose a hierarchical backoff model for phrase-
based translation that integrates several layers of
morphological operations, such that more specific
models are preferred over more general models.
We experimentally evaluate the model on transla-
tion from two highly-inflected languages, German
and Finnish, into English and present improve-
ments over a state-of-the-art system. The rest of
the paper is structured as follows: The following
section discusses related background work. Sec-
tion 4 describes the proposed model; Sections 5
and 6 provide details about the data and baseline
system used in this study. Section 7 provides ex-
perimental results and discussion. Section 8 con-
cludes.

2 Morphology in SMT Systems
Previous approaches have used morpho-syntactic
knowledge mainly at the low-level stages of a ma-
chine translation system, i.e. for preprocessing.
(Niessen and Ney, 2001a) use morpho-syntactic
knowledge for reordering certain syntactic con-
structions that differ in word order in the source
vs. target language (German and English). Re-
ordering is applied before training and after gener-
ating the output in the target language. Normaliza-
tion of English/German inflectional morphology
to base forms for the purpose of word alignment is
performed in (Corston-Oliver and Gamon, 2004)
and (Koehn, 2005), demonstrating that the vocab-
ulary size can be reduced significantly without af-
fecting performance.
Similar morphological simplifications have
been applied to other languages such as Roma-
nian (Fraser and Marcu, 2005) in order to de-
crease word alignment error rate. In (Niessen
and Ney, 2001b), a hierarchical lexicon model is
used that represents words as combinations of full
forms, base forms, and part-of-speech tags, and
that allows the word alignment training procedure
to interpolate counts based on the different lev-
els of representation. (Goldwater and McCloskey,
2005) investigate various morphological modifi-
cations for Czech-English translations: a subset
of the vocabulary was converted to stems, pseu-
dowords consisting of morphological tags were in-
troduced, and combinations of stems and morpho-
logical tags were used as new word forms. Small
improvements were found in combination with a
word-to-word translation model. Most of these
techniques have focused on improving word align-
ment or reducing vocabulary size; however, it is
often the case that better word alignment does not
improve the overall translation performance of a
standard phrase-based SMT system.
Phrase-based models themselves have not ben-
efited much from additional morpho-syntactic
knowledge; e.g. (Lioma and Ounis, 2005) do not
report any improvement from integrating part-of-
speech information at the phrase level. One suc-
cessful application of morphological knowledge is
(de Gispert et al., 2005), where knowledge-based
morphological techniques are used to identify un-
seen verb forms in the test text and to generate
inflected forms in the target language based on
annotated POS tags and lemmas. Phrase predic-
tion in the target language is conditioned on the
phrase in the source language as well the corre-
sponding tuple of lemmatized phrases. This tech-
nique worked well for translating from a morpho-
logically poor language (English) to a more highly
inflected language (Spanish) when applied to un-
seen verb forms. Treating both known and un-
known verbs in this way, however, did not result
in additional improvements. Here we extend the
notion of treating known and unknown words dif-
ferently and propose a backoff model for phrase-
based translation.
3 Backoff Models
Generally speaking, backoff models exploit rela-
tionships between more general and more spe-
cific probability distributions. They specify under
which conditions the more specific model is used
and when the model “backs off” to the more gen-
eral distribution. Backoff models have been used
in a variety of ways in natural language process-
ing, most notably in statistical language modeling.
In language modeling, a higher-order n-gram dis-
tribution is used when it is deemed reliable (deter-
mined by the number of occurrences in the train-
ing data); otherwise, the model backs off to the
next lower-order n-gram distribution. For the case
of trigrams, this can be expressed as:
pBO(wt|wt?1, wt?2) (2)
=
{
dcpML(wt|wt?1, wt?2) if c > ?
?(wt?1, wt?2)pBO(wt|wt?1) otherwise
where pML denotes the maximum-likelihood
estimate, c denotes the count of the triple
(wi, wi?1, wi?2) in the training data, ? is the count
threshold above which the maximum-likelihood
estimate is retained, and dN(wi,wi?1,wi?2) is a dis-
counting factor (generally between 0 and 1) that is
applied to the higher-order distribution. The nor-
malization factor ?(wi?1, wi?2) ensures that the
distribution sums to one. In (Bilmes and Kirch-
hoff, 2003) this method was generalized to a back-
off model with multiple paths, allowing the com-
bination of different backed-off probability esti-
mates. Hierarchical backoff schemes have also
been used by (Zitouni et al., 2003) for language
modeling and by (Gildea, 2001) for semantic role
labeling. (Resnik et al., 2001) used backoff trans-
lation lexicons for cross-language information re-
trieval. More recently, (Xi and Hwa, 2005) have
used backoff models for combining in-domain and
42
out-of-domain data for the purpose of bootstrap-
ping a part-of-speech tagger for Chinese, outper-
forming standard methods such as EM.
4 Backoff Models in MT
In order to handle unseen words in the test data
we propose a hierarchical backoff model that uses
morphological information. Several morphologi-
cal operations, in particular stemming and com-
pound splitting, are interleaved such that a more
specific form (i.e. a form closer to the full word
form) is chosen before a more general form (i.e. a
form that has undergone morphological process-
ing). The procedure is shown in Figure 1 and can
be described as follows: First, a standard phrase
table based on full word forms is trained. If an
unknown word fi is encountered in the test data
with context cfi = fi?n, ..., fi?1, fi+1, ..., fi+m,
the word is first stemmed, i.e. f ?i = stem(fi).
The phrase table entries for words sharing the
same stem are then modified by replacing the
respective words with their stems. If an en-
try can be found among these such that the
source language side of the phrase pair consists of
fi?n, ..., fi?1, stem(fi), fi+1, ..., fi+m, the corre-
sponding translation is used (or, if several pos-
sible translations occur, the one with the high-
est probability is chosen). Note that the con-
text may be empty, in which case a single-word
phrase is used. If this step fails, the model backs
off to the next level and applies compound split-
ting to the unknown word (further described be-
low), i.e.(f ??i1, f ??i2) = split(fi). The match with
the original word-based phrase table is then per-
formed again. If this step fails for either of the
two parts of f ??, stemming is applied again: f ???i1 =
stem(f ??i1) and f ???i2 = stem(f ??i2), and a match with
the stemmed phrase table entries is carried out.
Only if the attempted match fails at this level is the
input passed on verbatim in the translation output.
The backoff procedure could in principle be
performed on demand by a specialized decoder;
however, since we use an off-the-shelf decoder
(Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004)), backoff is implicitly en-
forced by providing a phrase-table that includes
all required backoff levels and by preprocessing
the test data accordingly. The phrase table will
thus include entries for phrases based on full word
forms as well as for their stemmed and/or split
counterparts.
For each entry with decomposed morphological

forms, four probabilities need to be provided: two
phrasal translation scores for both translation di-
rections, p(e¯|f¯) and p(f¯ |e¯), and two correspond-
ing lexical scores, which are computed as a prod-
uct of the word-by-word translation probabilities
under the given alignment a:
plex(e¯|f¯) =
J
?
j=1
1
|j|a(i) = j|
I
?
a(i)=j
p(fj |ei) (3)
where j ranges of words in phrase f¯ and i ranges
of words in phrase e¯. In the case of unknown
words in the foreign language, we need the prob-
abilities p(e¯|stem(f¯)), p(stem(f¯)|e¯) (where the
stemming operation stem(f¯) applies to the un-
known words in the phrase), and their lexical
equivalents. These are computed by relative fre-
quency estimation, e.g.
p(e¯|stem(f¯)) = count(e¯, stem(f¯))count(stem(f¯)) (4)
The other translation probabilities are computed
analogously. Since normalization is performed
over the entire phrase table, this procedure has
the effect of discounting the original probability
porig(e¯|f¯) since e¯ may now have been generated
by either f¯ or by stem(f¯). In the standard formu-
lation of backoff models shown in Equation 3, this
amounts to:
pBO(e¯|f¯) (5)
=
{
de¯,f¯porig(e¯|f¯) if c(e¯, f¯) > 0
p(e¯|stem(f¯)) otherwise
43
where
de¯,f¯ =
1 ? p(e¯, stem(f¯))
p(e¯, f¯) (6)
is the amount by which the word-based phrase
translation probability is discounted. Equiva-
lent probability computations are carried out for
the lexical translation probabilities. Similar to
the backoff level that uses stemming, the trans-
lation probabilities need to be recomputed for
the levels that use splitting and combined split-
ting/stemming.
In order to derive the morphological decompo-
sition we use existing tools. For stemming we
use the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) for German
and the Snowball stemmer1 for Finnish. A vari-
ety of ways for compound splitting have been in-
vestigated in machine translation (Koehn, 2003).
Here we use a simple technique that considers all
possible ways of segmenting a word into two sub-
parts (with a minimum-length constraint of three
characters on each subpart). A segmentation is ac-
cepted if the subparts appear as individual items
in the training data vocabulary. The only linguis-
tic knowledge used in the segmentation process is
the removal of final <s> from the first part of the
compound before trying to match it to an existing
word. This character (Fugen-s) is often inserted as
“glue” when forming German compounds. Other
glue characters were not considered for simplic-
ity (but could be added in the future). The seg-
mentation method is clearly not linguistically ad-
equate: first, words may be split into more than
two parts. Second, the method may generate mul-
tiple possible segmentations without a principled
way of choosing among them; third, it may gener-
ate invalid splits. However, a manual analysis of
300 unknown compounds in the German develop-
ment set (see next section) showed that 95.3% of
them were decomposed correctly: for the domain
at hand, most compounds need not be split into
more than two parts; if one part is itself a com-
pound it is usually frequent enough in the train-
ing data to have a translation. Furthermore, lexi-
calized compounds, whose decomposition would
lead to wrong translations, are also typically fre-
quent words and have an appropriate translation in
the training data.

5 Data
Our data consists of the Europarl training, devel-
opment and test definitions for German-English
and Finnish-English of the 2005 ACL shared data
task (Koehn and Monz, 2005). Both German
and Finnish are morphologically rich languages:
German has four cases and three genders and
shows number, gender and case distinctions not
only on verbs, nouns, and adjectives, but also
on determiners. In addition, it has notoriously
many compounds. Finnish is a highly agglutina-
tive language with a large number of inflectional
paradigms (e.g. one for each of its 15 cases). Noun
compounds are also frequent. On the 2005 ACL
shared MT data task, Finnish to English trans-
lation showed the lowest average performance
(17.9% BLEU) and German had the second low-
est (21.9%), while the average BLEU scores for
French-to-English and Spanish-to-English were
much higher (27.1% and 27.8%, respectively).
The data was preprocessed by lowercasing and
filtering out sentence pairs whose length ratio
(number of words in the source language divided
by the number of words in the target language,
or vice versa) was > 9. The development and
test sets consist of 2000 sentences each. In order
to study the effect of varying amounts of training
data we created several training partitions consist-
ing of random selections of a subset of the full
training set. The sizes of the partitions are shown
in Table 1, together with the resulting percentage
of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words in the develop-
ment and test sets (“type” refers to a unique word
in the vocabulary, “token” to an instance in the ac-
tual text).
6 System
We use a two-pass phrase-based statistical MT
system using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) for
word alignment and Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004) for
phrase extraction and decoding. Word alignment
is performed in both directions using the IBM-
4 model. Phrases are then extracted from the
word alignments using the method described in
(Och and Ney, 2003). For first-pass decoding we
use Pharaoh in n-best mode. The decoder uses a
weighted combination of seven scores: 4 transla-
tion model scores (phrase-based and lexical scores
for both directions), a trigram language model
score, a distortion score, and a word penalty. Non-
monotonic decoding is used, with no limit on the

are trained by a minimum error rate training pro-
cedure similar to (Och and Ney, 2003). The tri-
gram language model uses modified Kneser-Ney
smoothing and interpolation of trigram and bigram
estimates and was trained on the English side of
the bitext. In the first pass, 2000 hypotheses are
generated per sentence. In the second pass, the
seven scores described above are combined with
4-gram language model scores. The performance
of the baseline system on the development and test
sets is shown in Table 2. The BLEU scores ob-
tained are state-of-the-art for this task.
7 Experiments and Results
We first investigated to what extent the OOV rate
on the development data could be reduced by our
backoff procedure. Table 3 shows the percentage
of words that are still untranslatable after back-
off. A comparison with Table 1 shows that the
backoff model reduces the OOV rate, with a larger
reduction effect observed when the training set
is smaller. We next performed translation with
backoff systems trained on each data partition. In
each case, the combination weights for the indi-

vidual model scores were re-optimized. Table 4
shows the evaluation results on the dev set. Since
the BLEU score alone is often not a good indi-
cator of successful translations of unknown words
(the unigram or bigram precision may be increased
but may not have a strong effect on the over-
all BLEU score), position-independent word error
rate (PER) rate was measured as well. We see im-
provements in BLEU score and PERs in almost
all cases. Statistical significance was measured on
PER using a difference of proportions significance
test and on BLEU using a segment-level paired
t-test. PER improvements are significant almost
all training conditions for both languages; BLEU
improvements are significant in all conditions for
Finnish and for the two smallest training sets for
German. The effect on the overall development set
(consisting of both sentences with known words
only and sentences with unknown words) is shown
in Table 5. As expected, the impact on overall per-
formance is smaller, especially for larger training
data sets, due to the relatively small percentage of
OOV tokens (see Table 1). The evaluation results
for the test set are shown in Tables 6 (for the sub-
set of sentences with OOVs) and 7 (for the entire
test set), with similar conclusions.

D in Figure 2), the backoff model produced a
good translation, but the translation was a para-
phrase rather than an identical match to the ref-
erence translation. Since only a single reference
translation is available for the Europarl data (pre-
venting the computation of a BLEU score based
on multiple hand-annotated references), good but
non-matching translations are not taken into ac-
count by our evaluation method. In other cases
the unknown word was translated correctly, but
since it was translated as single-word phrase the
segmentation of the entire sentence was affected.
This may cause greater distortion effects since the
sentence is segmented into a larger number of
smaller phrases, each of which can be reordered.
We therefore added the possibility of translating
an unknown word in its phrasal context by stem-
ming up to m words to the left and right in the
original sentence and finding translations for the
entire stemmed phrase (i.e. the function stem()
is now applied to the entire phrase). This step
is inserted before the stemming of a single word
f in the backoff model described above. How-
ever, since translations for entire stemmed phrases
were found only in about 1% of all cases, there
was no significant effect on the BLEU score. An-
other possibility of limiting reordering effects re-
sulting from single-word translations of OOVs is
to restrict the distortion limit of the decoder. Our

the same.
8 Conclusions
We have presented a backoff model for phrase-
based SMT that uses morphological abstractions
to translate unseen word forms in the foreign lan-
guage input. When a match for an unknown word
in the test set cannot be found in the trained phrase
table, the model relies instead on translation prob-
abilities derived from stemmed or split versions
of the word in its phrasal context. An evalua-
tion of the model on German-English and Finnish-
English translations of parliamentary proceedings
showed statistically significant improvements in
PER for almost all training conditions and signifi-
cant improvements in BLEU when the training set
is small (100K words), with larger improvements
for Finnish than for German. This demonstrates
that our method is mainly relevant for highly in-
flected languages and sparse training data condi-
tions. It is also designed to improve human accep-
tance of machine translation output, which is par-
ticularly adversely affected by untranslated words.

Example A: (German-English):
SRC: wir sind berzeugt davon, dass ein europa des friedens
nicht durch milita¨rbu¨ndnisse geschaffen wird.
BASE: we are convinced that a europe of peace, not by
milita¨rbu¨ndnisse is created.
BACKOFF: we are convinced that a europe of peace, not
by military alliance is created.
REF: we are convinced that a europe of peace will not be
created through military alliances.
Example B. (Finnish-English):
SRC: arvoisa puhemies, puhuimme ta¨a¨lla¨ eilisiltana
serviasta ja siella¨ tapahtuvista vallankumouksellisista
muutoksista.
BASE: mr president, we talked about here last night, on
the subject of serbia and there, of vallankumouksellisista
changes.
BACKOFF: mr president, we talked about here last
night, on the subject of serbia and there, of revolutionary
changes.
REF: mr. president, last night we discussed the topic of
serbia and the revolutionary changes that are taking place
there.
Example C. (Finnish-English):
SRC: toivon ta¨lta¨ osin, etta¨ yhdistyneiden kansakuntien
alaisuudessa ka¨yta¨vissa¨ neuvotteluissa pa¨a¨sta¨isiin sell-
aiseen lopputulokseen, etta¨ kyproksen kreikkalainen ja
turkkilainen va¨esto¨nosa voisivat yhdessa¨ nauttia liittymisen
mukanaan tuomista eduista yhdistetyssa¨ tasavallassa.
BASE: i hope that the united nations in the negotiations
to reach a conclusion that the greek and turkish accession
to the benefi t of the benefi ts of the republic of ydistetyssa¨
brings together va¨esto¨nosa could, in this respect, under the
auspices.
BACKOFF: i hope that the united nations in the nego-
tiations to reach a conclusion that the greek and turkish
communities can work together to bring the benefi ts of the
accession of the republic of ydistetyssa¨. in this respect,
under the
REF: in this connection, i would hope that the talks
conducted under the auspices of the united nations will be
able to come to a successful conclusion enabling the greek
and turkish cypriot populations to enjoy the advantages
of membership of the european union in the context of a
reunifi ed republic.
Example D. (German-English):
SRC:so sind wir beim durcharbeiten des textes verfahren,
wobei wir bei einer reihe von punkten versucht haben, noch
einige straffungen vorzunehmen.
BASE: we are in the durcharbeiten procedures of the text,
although we have tried to make a few straffungen to carry
out on a number of issues.
BACKOFF: we are in the durcharbeiten procedures, and
we have tried to make a few streamlining of the text in a
number of points.
REF: this is how we came to go through the text, and
attempted to cut down on certain items in the process.
