Abstract
Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM-
M) has great potential for detecting the
underlying structure of data. Extensive
studies have applied it for text cluster-
ing in terms of topics. However, due to
the unsupervised nature, the topic cluster-
s are always less satisfactory. Considering
that people often have some prior knowl-
edge about which potential topics should
exist in given data, we aim to incorpo-
rate such knowledge into the DPMM to
improve text clustering. We propose a
novel model TSDPMM based on a new
seeded P´olya urn scheme. Experimen-
tal results on document clustering across
three datasets demonstrate our proposed
TSDPMM significantly outperforms state-
of-the-art DPMM model and can be ap-
plied in a lifelong learning framework.
1 Introduction
Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) (Neal,
2000) has been used in detecting the underlying
structure in data. For example, (Vlachos et al.,
2008; Vlachos et al., 2009) applied it to lexical-
semantic verb clustering. (Wang et al., 2011;
Huang et al., 2013; Yin and Wang, 2014) applied
it for text clustering in terms of their topics. While
DPMM achieved some promising results, it can
still sometimes produce unsatisfactory topic clus-
ters due to its unsupervised nature.
On the other hand, people often have prior
knowledge about what potential topics should ex-
ist in a given text corpus. Take an earthquake event
corpus as an example. The topics, such as “ca-
sualties and damages”, “rescue” and “government
reaction”, called prior topics, are expected to oc-
cur in the corpus according to our common knowl-
edge (e.g., the topics automatically learned from
previous events using topic modeling (Ahmed and
Xing, 2008)) or external resources (e.g., table of
contents at Wikipedia event pages
1
). Similarly, in
academic fields, “call for papers (CFP)” of confer-
ences
2
lists main topics that conference organizers
would like to focus on. Clearly, these prior topic-
s can be represented as sets of words, which are
available in many real-world applications. They
can serve as weakly supervised information to en-
hance the unsupervised DPMM for text clustering.
Standard DPMM (Neal, 2000; Ranganathan,
2006) lacks a mechanism for incorporating pri-
or knowledge. Some existing work (Vlachos et
al., 2008; Vlachos et al., 2009) added knowledge
of observed instance-level constraints (must-links
and cannot-links between documents) to DPMM.
(Ahmed and Xing, 2008) proposed recurrent Chi-
nese Restaurant Process to incorporate previous
documents with known topic clusters. We focus
on incorporating topic-level knowledge, which is
more challenging, as seed/prior topics could be la-
tent rather than observable.
Particularly, we construct our novel TSDPM-
M (Topic Seeded DPMM) based on a principled
seeded P´olya urn (sPU) scheme. Our model inher-
its the nonparametric property of DPMM and has
additional technical merits. Importantly, our mod-
el is encouraged but not forced to find evidences of
seed topics. Therefore, it has freedom to discover
new topics beyond prior topics, as well as to detect
which prior topics are not covered by current da-
ta. It is thus convenient to observe topic variations
between prior topics and newly mined topics. Ex-
perimental results on document clustering across
three corpora demonstrate that our model effec-
tively incorporates prior topics, and significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art DPMM model. Par-
ticularly, our TSDPMM can be applied in a life-
long learning framework which enables the prior

topic knowledge to evolve as more and more data
are observed.
2 Topic Seeded DPMM
In this section, we first introduce the standard
DPMM model for document clustering in terms
of topics. Then we describe how to incorporate
seed/prior topics into the model using a seeded
P´olya urn (sPU) scheme, which gives us our novel
TSDPMM model (Topic Seeded DPMM). Finally,
we present the model inference.
2.1 DPMM
The DPMM (Antoniak, 1974) as a non-parametric
model assumes the given data is governed by an
infinite number of components where only a frac-
tion of these components are activated by the da-
ta. Figure 1 illustrates the DPMM graphical model
and its generative process of a document x
i
. First,
we sample a topic ?
i
= {?
ij
}
j=|V |
j=1
(a multinomial
distribution over words belonging to the vocabu-
lary V ) for the document x
i
according to a Dirich-
let Process (DP) G ? DP (?,G
0
), where ? > 0
is a concentration parameter and the base measure
G
0
= Dir(
?
?) can be considered as a prior distri-
bution for ?. Consider the document x
i
as a bag of
words, given the topic ?
i
, the generative distribu-
tionF is a given likelihood function parameterized
by ?. We define F as p(x
i
|?
i
) =
?
|x
i
|
j=1
p(x
ij
|?
i
),
where x
ij
is the j
th
word in x
i
. Note that the DP-
MM assumes each document can be assigned to
one topic cluster only.
Figure 1: Graphical Representation of DPMM.
The DP process of DPMM, according to which
topic ?
i
for a document x
i
is drawn, can be ex-
plained by the popular metaphor of P´olya urn (PU)
scheme (Blackwell and MacQueen, 1973), equiv-
alent to the Chinese Restaurant Process (Ahmed
and Xing, 2008). The PU scheme works on balls
(documents) and colors (topics). It starts with an
empty urn. With probability proportional to ?, we
draw ?
i
? G
0
, and add a ball of this color to the
urn. With probability proportional to i ? 1 (i.e.,
the current number of balls in the urn), we draw
a ball at random from the urn, observe its color ?
i
and replace the ball with two balls of the same col-
or. In this way, we draw topic ?
i
for document x
i
.
As shown in the process, the prior probability of
assigning a document to a topic is proportional to
the number of documents already assigned to the
topic. As a result, the DPMM exhibits the “rich
get richer” property.
2.2 TSDPMM: Incorporating Seed Topics
In this section, we describe our proposed algorith-
m to incorporate prior seed topics into the DPM-
M. A prior/seed topic k is represented by a vec-
tor
?
N
(0)
k
(word frequencies under the topic). We
can obtain the prior topics represented by
?
N
(0)
k
from past learning of topic models or external re-
sources such as Wikipedia and “CFP”. Assuming
we have K
(0)
prior topics, we use the parame-
ter ??
(0)
= {?
(0)
k
}
K
(0)
k=1
to control our confidence
about how likely each prior topic exists. Let us
go back to P´olya urn (PU) scheme, where a prior
topic can be taken as a known color. We extend
the PU scheme to incorporate prior topics, which
gives the sPU (seeded P´olya Urn) scheme. The
sPU scheme can be described as follows:
• We start with an urn with ?
(0)
k
balls of each
known color k ? {1, ...,K
(0)
}.
• With a probability proportional to ?, we draw
?
i
? G
0
and add a ball of this color to the urn.
• With probability proportional to i ? 1 +
?
K
(0)
k=1
?
(0)
k
, we draw a random ball from the
urn, and replace the ball with two balls of the
same color.
As shown in the above process, instead of start-
ing with an empty urn in DPMM, we assume that
the urn already has certain balls of known colors.
In this way, we incorporate the prior seed topic-
s. The number of initial balls (documents) ?
(0)
k
controls how likely the topic k exists. We can use
different values of ?
(0)
k
for prior topics with dif-
ferent confidence levels. This sPU scheme gives
our novel model TSDPMM (Topic Seeded DPM-
M) incorporating prior topics. The TSDPMM has
788
similar graphical representation as DPMM (Fig-
ure 1), except the introduction of hyper-parameter
??
(0)
. We then present a collapsed gibbs sampling
algorithm for model inference as follows.
TSDPMM Inference. The model inference is
described in detail in Algorithm 1. It first ini-
tializes all documents with random topic clusters.
Then it iteratively updates the topic cluster assign-
ments of documents according to the conditional
probabilities (Eq.1) until convergence. Eq.1 can
be derived as:

equation, documents are likely to go into clusters
which are bigger and give higher likelihood of the
documents. When the Gibbs sampler converges,
we obtain topic cluster assignments of all the doc-
uments. Different from DPMM inference process
in which topics are removed when no documents is
assigned to them, TSDPMM inference can retain
prior topics all the time due to the initial number
of documents ??
(0)
, making it able to track prior
topics, as well as to detect new topics.
3 Experiments
We evaluate our proposed TSDPMM model for
document clustering on 3 datasets where each
cluster corresponds to a topic. We implement both
DPMM and TSDPMM models — their source
codes are available at https://github.com/
newsminer/DPMM_and_TSDPMM.
3.1 Datasets
We collect machine learning conference NIPS
datasets composed of paper titles and abstracts
from 2012 to 2014 – each year includes 342, 360
and 411 documents respectively. They are named
as NIPS-12, NIPS-13 and NIPS-14.
We also employ the standard benchmark news
datasets, including 20 Newsgroups
3
and Reuters-
21578. As news is often timely reported, we
choose three continuous days with the largest
number of documents in 20 Newsgroups (i.e. 11,
12 and 13 May) and Reuters-21578 (i.e. 3, 4 and
5 March) for our experiments. These datasets are
3
http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/
789
denoted as 20N-1, 20N-2, 20N-3 (including 103,
96, 106 documents) and Reu-1, Reu-2, Reu-3 ( in-
cluding 282, 249, 207 documents), respectively.
For all the datasets, we conduct the following
preprocessing: (1) Convert letters into lowercase;
(2) Remove non-Latin characters and stop words;
(3) Remove words with document frequency < 2.
3.2 Experimental Setup
We take the standard DPMM as our baseline
method and compare it with our proposed TSDP-
MM model using different prior knowledge ob-
tained with different manners.
For NIPS datasets, we use two kinds of prior
knowledge: one is the topics learned by DPMM
from previous year’s dataset; the other one is from
an external resource “CFP”
4
(10 topics, same for
each year). We name them as TSDPMM-P and
TSDPMM-E respectively. As the topic descrip-
tions in “CFP” are sparse, we repeat each topic
description by ten times and then represent a topic
with the words with word frequencies in its de-
scription text.
For both 20 Newsgroups and Reuters datasets,
we use prior knowledge learned by DPMM from
the previous day’s dataset. Furthermore, to test
if we can improve the results continuously by ap-
plying TSDPMM, every time when we model a
new dataset, we incorporate prior topics learned
by TSDPMM from previous day’s dataset, similar
to lifelong learning (Chen and Liu, 2014; Thrun,
1998). We call this model as TSDPMM-L.
Parameter Setting. Following a previous work
(Vlachos et al., 2009), we set the hyper-parameters
?=1, ??
(0)
={1.0},
?
? ={1.0}. We run Gibbs sam-
pler for 100 iterations and stop the iteration once
the log-likelihood of the training data converges.
Evaluation. The widely used NMI (normal-
ized mutual information) measure (Dom, 2002),
has been employed to evaluate document cluster-
ing results. The higher a value of NMI, the better
a clustering result is. However, NMI needs true
class labels for documents, and can only be ap-
plied to our benchmark news datasets. For NIPS
datasets without true labels, we use the measure of
perplexity, as defined in (Blei et al., 2003), to test
per-word likelihood of the datasets. The lower the
perplexity, the better a model fits the data.

3.3 Results
Table 1 shows the average perplexity values of
five runs of 3 models on NIPS datasets. It shows
that both TSDPMM-P and TSDPMM-E, lever-
aging prior topics from previous learning and
“CFP” significantly outperform DPMM. In ad-
dition, TSDPMM-E achieves lower performance
than TSDPMM-P due to its lower quality of prior
topics directly obtained from “CFP”, compared to
higher quality topics from past learning. We may
improve “CFP” knowledge by extending it with
related texts from search engines or Wikipedia us-
ing keywords in “CFP” in future work.
An insight of our clustering results on NIPS-14
dataset suggests that most prior topics in 2013 are
covered again in 2014 (consistent topics), except
a few missing topics such as “lasso for Bayesian
networks”. Additionally, some newly evolved top-
ics in 2014, e.g. “monte carlo particle filtering”
and “nash games”, are successfully discovered by
our proposed model.

Table 2 illustrates the average NMI values of
five runs of DPMM, TSDPMM and TSDPMM-L
on news datasets. The results show that TSDP-
MM using prior topics learnt by DPMM outper-
forms DPMM (on average +5.8%; p <0.025 with
t-test). Additionally, TSDPMM-L, which continu-
ously uses prior topics learnt by TSDPMM from
previous dataset, further outperforms TSDPMM
(on average +3.2%; p <0.025 with t-test). Note
TSDPMM-L uses TSDPMM results of 20N-1 and
Reu-1 as prior knowledge for the first time, so
there are no TSDPMM-L results for the first days
in Table 2 for 20N-1 and Reu-1 respectively.
3.4 Discussion
The experimental results across 3 datasets have
demonstrated that our proposed models can im-
prove DPMM model by incorporating prior top-
ic knowledge, and the higher-quality knowledge
will lead to better results. By applying our TS-
DPMM in a lifelong continuous learning frame-
work, namely TSDPMM-L, can further improve

4 Related Work
Our work is related to papers (Vlachos et al.,
2008; Vlachos et al., 2009), which added supervi-
sion (instance-level must-links or cannot-links be-
tween documents) to the DPMM. (Ahmed and X-
ing, 2008) proposed recurrent Chinese Restauran-
t Process to incorporate previous documents with
known topic clusters. However, our work is very
different as we focus on how to incorporate latent
topic-level prior knowledge. We model prior top-
ics as known colors that have a certain probability
proportional to ?
(0)
k
to be assigned to a document.
In addition, our inference mechanism subsequent-
ly takes the prior knowledge into consideration for
automatically assigning topics to documents.
Some existing studies such as (Ramage et al.,
2009; Andrzejewski et al., 2009; Jagarlamudi et
al., 2012; Andrzejewski et al., 2011) worked on
incorporating prior lexical or domain knowledge
into LDA. Different from all these work, we focus
on the nonparametric model DPMM and propose
to incorporate the prior topic knowledge obtained
in multiple ways.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel problem of in-
corporating prior topics into DPMM model and
address it through a simple yet principled seeded
P´olya urn scheme. We show that the topic knowl-
edge can be obtained in multiple ways. Exper-
iments on document clustering across 3 dataset-
s demonstrate our proposed model can effectively
incorporate the prior topic knowledge and signifi-
cantly enhance the standard DPMM for text clus-
tering. In future work, we will study how to dis-
cover overlapping clusters, i.e., allowing one doc-
ument to be grouped into multiple topic cluster-
s. We will also explore how to incorporate prior
knowledge about topic relations (such as causation
and correlation) into topic modeling.
