Abstract
Although a lot of progress has been made
recently in word segmentation and POS
tagging for Chinese, the output of cur-
rent state-of-the-art systems is too inaccu-
rate to allow for syntactic analysis based
on it. We present an experiment in im-
proving the output of an off-the-shelf mod-
ule that performs segmentation and tag-
ging, the tokenizer-tagger from Beijing
University (PKU). Our approach is based
on transformation-based learning (TBL).
Unlike in other TBL-based approaches to
the problem, however, both obligatory and
optional transformation rules are learned,
so that the final system can output multi-
ple segmentation and POS tagging anal-
yses for a given input. By allowing for
a small amount of ambiguity in the out-
put of the tokenizer-tagger, we achieve a
very considerable improvement in accu-
racy. Compared to the PKU tokenizer-
tagger, we improve segmentation F-score
from 94.18% to 96.74%, tagged word
F-score from 84.63% to 92.44%, seg-
mented sentence accuracy from 47.15%
to 65.06% and tagged sentence accuracy
from 14.07% to 31.47%.
1 Introduction
Word segmentation and tagging are the neces-
sary initial steps for almost any language process-
ing system, and Chinese parsers are no exception.
However, automatic Chinese word segmentation
and tagging has been recognized as a very difficult
task (Sproat and Emerson, 2003), for the follow-
ing reasons:
First, Chinese text provides few cues for word
boundaries (Xia, 2000; Wu, 2003) and part-of-
speech (POS) information. With the exception of
punctuation marks, Chinese does not have word
delimiters such as the whitespace used in English
text, and unlike other languages without whites-
paces such as Japanese, Chinese lacks morpholog-
ical inflections that could provide cues for word
boundaries and POS information. In fact, the lack
of word boundary marks and morphological in-
flection contributes not only to mistakes in ma-
chine processing of Chinese; it has also been iden-
tified as a factor for parsing miscues in Chinese
children’s reading behavior (Chang et al., 1992).
Second, in addition to the two problems de-
scribed above, segmentation and tagging also suf-
fer from the fact that the notion of a word is
very unclear in Chinese (Xu, 1997; Packard, 2000;
Hsu, 2002). While the word is an intuitive and
salient notion in English, it is by no means a
clear notion in Chinese. Instead, for historical
reasons, the intuitive and clear notion in Chinese
language and culture is the character rather than
the word. Classical Chinese is in general mono-
syllabic, with each syllable corresponding to an
independent morpheme that can be visually ren-
dered with a written character. In other words,
characters did represent the basic syntactic unit in
Classical Chinese, and thus became the sociolog-
ically intuitive notion. However, although collo-
quial Chinese quickly evolved throughout Chinese
history to be disyllabic or multi-syllabic, monosyl-
labic Classical Chinese has been considered more
elegant and proper and was commonly used in
written text until the early 20th century in China.
Even in Modern Chinese written text, Classical
Chinese elements are not rare. Consequently, even
if a morpheme represented by a character is no
264
longer used independently in Modern colloquial
Chinese, it might still appear to be a free mor-
pheme in modern written text, because it contains
Classical Chinese elements. This fact leads to a
phenomenon in which Chinese speakers have dif-
ficulty differentiating whether a character repre-
sents a bound or free morpheme, which in turn
affects their judgment regarding where the word
boundaries should be. As pointed out by Hoosain
(Hoosain, 1992), the varying knowledge of Classi-
cal Chinese among native Chinese speakers in fact
affects their judgments about what is or is not a
word. In summary, due to the influence of Classi-
cal Chinese, the notion of a word and the bound-
ary between a bound and free morpheme is very
unclear for Chinese speakers, which in turn leads
to a fuzzy perception of where word boundaries
should be.
Consequently, automatic segmentation and tag-
ging in Chinese faces a serious challenge from
prevalent ambiguities. For example 1, the string
“???” can be segmented as (1a) or (1b), de-
pending on the context.
(1) a. ? ??
yo?u y?`jian
have disagreement
b. ?? ?
yo?uy?` jia`n
have the intention meet
The contrast shown in (2) illustrates that even a
string that is not ambiguous in terms of segmenta-
tion can still be ambiguous in terms of tagging.
(2) a. ?/a ?/n
ba´i hua¯
white flower
b. ?/d ?/v
ba´i hua¯
in vain spend
‘spend (money, time, energy etc.) in vain’
Even Chinese speakers cannot resolve such am-
biguities without using further information from
a bigger context, which suggests that resolving
segmentation and tagging ambiguities probably
should not be a task or goal at the word level. In-
stead, we should preserve such ambiguities in this
level and leave them to be resolved in a later stage,
when more information is available.
1(1) and (2) are cited from (Fang and King, 2007)
To summarize, the word as a notion and hence
word boundaries are very unclear; segmentation
and tagging are prevalently ambiguous in Chinese.
These facts suggest that Chinese segmentation and
part-of-speech identification are probably inher-
ently non-deterministic at the word level. How-
ever most of the current segmentation and/or tag-
ging systems output a single result.
While a deterministic approach to Chinese seg-
mentation and POS tagging might be appropriate
and necessary for certain tasks or applications, it
has been shown to suffer from a problem of low
accuracy. As pointed out by Yu (Yu et al., 2004),
although the segmentation and tagging accuracy
for certain types of text can reach as high as 95%,
the accuracy for open domain text is only slightly
higher than 80%. Furthermore, Chinese segmenta-
tion (SIGHAN) bakeoff results also show that the
performance of the Chinese segmentation systems
has not improved a whole lot since 2003. This
fact also indicates that deterministic approaches
to Chinese segmentation have hit a bottleneck in
terms of accuracy.
The system for which we improved the output
of the Beijing tokenizer-tagger is a hand-crafted
Chinese grammar. For such a system, as proba-
bly for any parsing system that presupposes seg-
mented (and tagged) input, the accuracy of the
segmentation and POS tagging analyses is criti-
cal. However, as described in detail in the fol-
lowing section, even current state-of-art systems
cannot provide satisfactory results for our ap-
plication. Based on the experiments presented
in section 3, we believe that a proper amount
of non-deterministic results can significantly im-
prove the Chinese segmentation and tagging accu-
racy, which in turn improves the performance of
the grammar.
2 Background
The improved tokenizer-tagger we developed is
part of a larger system, namely a deep Chinese
grammar (Fang and King, 2007). The system
is hybrid in that it uses probability estimates for
parse pruning (and it is planned to use trained
weights for parse ranking), but the “core” gram-
mar is rule-based. It is written within the frame-
work of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) and
implemented on the XLE system (Crouch et al.,
2006; Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996). The input to
our system is a raw Chinese string such as (3).
265

‘XiaoWang left.’
The output of the Chinese LFG consists of a
Constituent Structure (c-structure) and a Func-
tional Structure (f-structure) for each sentence.
While c-structure represents phrasal structure and
linear word order, f-structure represents various
functional relations between parts of sentences.
For example, (4) and (5) are the c-structure and f-
structure that the grammar produces for (3). Both
c-structure and f-structure information are carried
in syntactic rules in the grammar.
(4) c-structure of (3)
(5) f-structure of (3)
To parse a sentence, the Chinese LFG min-
imally requires three components: a tokenizer-
tagger, a lexicon, and syntactic rules. The
tokenizer-tagger that is currently used in the gram-
mar is developed by Beijing University (PKU)3
and is incorporated as a library transducer (Crouch
et al., 2006).
Because the grammar’s syntactic rules are ap-
plied based upon the results produced by the
tokenizer-tagger, the performance of the latter is

critical to overall quality of the system’s out-
put. However, even though PKU’s tokenizer-
tagger is one of the state-of-art systems, its per-
formance is not satisfactory for the Chinese LFG.
This becomes clear from a small-scale evaluation
in which the system was tested on a set of 101
gold sentences chosen from the Chinese Treebank
5 (CTB5) (Xue et al., 2002; Xue et al., 2005).
These 101 sentences are 10-20 words long and
all of them are chosen from Xinhua sources 4.
Based on the deterministic segmentation and tag-
ging results produced by PKU’s tokenizer-tagger,
the Chinese LFG can only parse 80 out of the
101 sentences. Among the 80 sentences that are
parsed, 66 received full parses and 14 received
fragmented parses. Among the 21 completely
failed sentences, 20 sentences failed due to seg-
mentation and tagging mistakes.
This simple test shows that in order for the
deep Chinese grammar to be practically useful,
the performance of the tokenizer-tagger must be
improved. One way to improve the segmentation
and tagging accuracy is to allow non-deterministic
segmentation and tagging for Chinese for the rea-
sons stated in Section 1. Therefore, our goal
is to find a way to transform PKU’s tokenizer-
tagger into a system that produces a proper amount
of non-deterministic segmentation and tagging re-
sults, one that can significantly improve the sys-
tem’s accuracy without a substantial sacrifice in
terms of efficiency. Our approach is described in
the following section.
3 FST5 Rules for the Improvement of
Segmentation and Tagging Output
For grammars of other languages implemented on
the XLE grammar development platform, the in-
put is usually preprocessed by a cascade of gener-
ally non-deterministic finite state transducers that
perform tokenization, morphological analysis etc.
Since word segmentation and POS tagging are
such hard problems in Chinese, this traditional
setup is not an option for the Chinese grammar.
However, finite state rules seem a quite natural ap-
proach to improving in XLE the output of a sep-
4The reason why only sentences from Xinhua sources
were chosen is because the version of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger
that was integrated into the system was not designed to han-
dle data from Hong Kong and Taiwan.
5We use the abbreviation “FST” for “finite-state trans-
ducer”. fst is used to refer to the finite-state tool called fst,
which was developed by Beesley and Karttunen (2003).

arate segmentation and POS tagging module like
PKU’s tokenizer-tagger.
3.1 Hand-Crafted FST Rules for Concept
Proving
Although the grammar developer had identified
PKU’s tokenizer-tagger as the most suitable for
the preprocessing of Chinese raw text that is
to be parsed with the Chinese LFG, she no-
ticed in the process of development that (i) cer-
tain segmentation and/or tagging decisions taken
by the tokenizer-tagger systematically go counter
her morphosyntactic judgment and that (ii) the
tokenizer-tagger (as any software of its kind)
makes mistakes. She therefore decided to develop
a set of finite-state rules that transform the output
of the module; a set of mostly obligatory rewrite
rules adapts the POS-tagged word sequence to the
grammar’s standard, and another set of mostly op-
tional rules tries to offer alternative segment and
tag sequences for sequences that are frequently
processed erroneously by PKU’s tokenizer-tagger.
Given the absence of data segmented and tagged
according to the standard the LFG grammar de-
veloper desired, the technique of hand-crafting
FST rules to postprocess the output of PKU’s
tokenizer-tagger worked surprisingly well. Re-
call that based on the deterministic segmentation
and tagging results produced by PKU’s tokenizer-
tagger, our system can only parse 80 out of the 101
sentences, and among the 21 completely failed
sentences, 20 sentences failed due to segmenta-
tion and tagging mistakes. In contrast, after the
application of the hand-crafted FST rules for post-
processing, 100 out of the 101 sentences can be
parsed. However, this approach involved a lot
of manual development work (about 3-4 person
months) and has reached a stage where it is dif-
ficult to systematically work on further improve-
ments.
3.2 Machine-Learned FST Rules
Since there are large amounts of training data that
are close to the segmentation and tagging standard
the grammar developer wants to use, the idea of
inducing FST rules rather than hand-crafting them
comes quite naturally. The easiest way to do this
is to apply transformation-based learning (TBL) to
the combined problem of Chinese segmentation
and POS tagging, since the cascade of transfor-
mational rules learned in a TBL training run can
straightforwardly be translated into a cascade of
FST rules.
3.2.1 Transformation-Based Learning and
µ-TBL
TBL is a machine learning approach that has been
employed to solve a number of problems in nat-
ural language processing; most famously, it has
been used for part-of-speech tagging (Brill, 1995).
TBL is a supervised learning approach, since it re-
lies on gold-annotated training data. In addition,
it relies on a set of templates of transformational
rules; learning consists in finding a sequence of in-
stantiations of these templates that minimizes the
number of errors in a more or less naive base-line
output with respect to the gold-annotated training
data.
The first attempts to employ TBL to solve the
problem of Chinese word segmentation go back to
Palmer (1997) and Hockenmaier and Brew (1998).
In more recent work, TBL was used for the adap-
tion of the output of a statistical “general pur-
pose” segmenter to standards that vary depend-
ing on the application that requires sentence seg-
mentation (Gao et al., 2004). TBL approaches to
the combined problem of segmenting and POS-
tagging Chinese sentences are reported in Florian
and Ngai (2001) and Fung et al. (2004).
Several implementations of the TBL approach
are freely available on the web, the most well-
known being the so-called Brill tagger, fnTBL,
which allows for multi-dimensional TBL, and
µ-TBL (Lager, 1999). Among these, we chose
µ-TBL for our experiments because (like fnTBL)
it is completely flexible as to whether a sample
is a word, a character or anything else and (un-
like fnTBL) it allows for the induction of optional
rules. Probably due to its flexibility, µ-TBL has
been used (albeit on a small scale for the most part)
for tasks as diverse as POS tagging, map tasks, and
machine translation.
3.2.2 Experiment Set-up
We started out with a corpus of thirty gold-
segmented and -tagged daily editions of the Xin-
hua Daily, which were provided by the Institute
of Computational Linguistics at Beijing Univer-
sity. Three daily editions, which comprise 5,054
sentences with 129,377 words and 213,936 char-
acters, were set aside for testing purposes; the re-
maining 27 editions were used for training. With
the idea of learning both obligatory and optional
267
transformational rules in mind, we then split the
training data into two roughly equally sized sub-
sets. All the data were broken into sentences us-
ing a very simple method: The end of a para-
graph was always considered a sentence bound-
ary. Within paragraphs, sentence-final punctua-
tion marks such as periods (which are unambigu-
ous in Chinese), question marks and exclamation
marks, potentially followed by a closing parenthe-
sis, bracket or quote mark, were considered sen-
tence boundaries.
We then had to come up with a way of cast-
ing the problem of combined segmentation and
POS tagging as a TBL problem. Following a strat-
egy widely used in Chinese word segmentation,
we did this by regarding the problem as a charac-
ter tagging problem. However, since we intended
to learn rules that deal with segmentation and
POS tagging simultaneously, we could not adopt
the BIO-coding approach.6 Also, since the TBL-
induced transformational rules were to be con-
verted into FST rules, we had to keep our character
tagging scheme one-dimensional, unlike Florian
and Ngai (2001), who used a multi-dimensional
TBL approach to solve the problem of combined
segmentation and POS tagging.
The character tagging scheme that we finally
chose is illustrated in (6), where a. and b. show the
character tags that we used for the analyses in (1a)
and (1b) respectively. The scheme consists in tag-
ging the last character of a word with the part-of-
speech of the entire word; all non-final characters
are tagged with ‘-’. The main advantages of this
character tagging scheme are that it expresses both
word boundaries and parts-of-speech and that, at
the same time, it is always consistent; inconsisten-
cies between BIO tags indicating word boundaries
and part-of-speech tags, which Florian and Ngai
(2001), for example, have to resolve, can simply
not arise.

Both of the training data subsets were tagged
according to our character tagging scheme and
6In this character tagging approach to word segmentation,
characters are tagged as the beginning of a word (B), inside
(or at the end) of a multi-character word (I) or a word of their
own (O). Their are numerous variations of this approach.
converted to the data format expected by µ-TBL.
The first training data subset was used for learn-
ing obligatory resegmentation and retagging rules.
The corresponding rule templates, which define
the space of possible rules to be explored, are
given in Figure 1. The training parameters of
µ-TBL, which are an accuracy threshold and a
score threshold, were set to 0.75 and 5 respec-
tively; this means that a potential rule was only
retained if at least 75% of the samples to which it
would have applied were actually modified in the
sense of the gold standard and not in some other
way and that the learning process was terminated
when no more rule could be found that applied to
at least 5 samples in the first training data subset.
With these training parameters, 3,319 obligatory
rules were learned by µ-TBL.
Once the obligatory rules had been learned on
the first training data subset, they were applied to
the second training data subset. Then, optional
rules were learned on this second training data
subset. The rule templates used for optional rules
are very similar to the ones used for obligatory
rules; a few templates of optional rules are given in
Figure 2. The difference between obligatory rules
and optional rules is that the former replace one
character tag by another, whereas the latter add
character tags. They hence introduce ambiguity,
which is why we call them optional rules. Like in
the learning of the obligatory rules, the accuracy
threshold used was 0.75; the score theshold was
set to 7 because the training software seemed to
hit a bug below that threshold. 753 optional rules
were learned. We did not experiment with the ad-
justment of the training parameters on a separate
held-out set.
Finally, the rule sets learned were converted into
the fst (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) notation for
transformational rules, so that they could be tested
and used in the FST cascade used for preprocess-
ing the input of the Chinese LFG. For evaluation,
the converted rules were applied to our test data set
of 5,054 sentences. A few example rules learned
by µ-TBL with the set-up described above are
given in Figure 3; we show them both in µ-TBL
notation and in fst notation.

Figure 2: Sample templates of optional rules used
in our experiments
tokenizer-tagger run in the mode where it returns
only the most probable tag for each word (PKU
one tag), of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger run in the
mode where it returns all possible tags for a given
word (PKU all tags), of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger
in one-tag mode augmented with the obligatory
transformational rules learned on the first part of
our training data (PKU one tag + deterministic rule
set), and of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger augmented
with both the obligatory and optional rules learned
on the first and second parts of our training data re-
spectively (PKU one tag + non-deterministic rule
set). We give results in terms of character tag ac-
curacy and ambiguity according to our character
tagging scheme. Then we provide evaluation fig-
ures for the word level. Finally, we give results re-
ferring to the sentence level in order to make clear
how serious a problem Chinese segmentation and
POS tagging still are for parsers, which obviously
operate at the sentence level.
These results show that simply switching from
the one-tag mode of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger to its
all-tags mode is not a solution. First of all, since
the tokenizer-tagger always produces only one
segmentation regardless of the mode it is used in,
segmentation accuracy would stay completely un-
affected by this change, which is particularly seri-
ous because there is no way for the grammar to re-
cover from segmentation errors and the tokenizer-
tagger produces an entirely correct segmentation
only for 47.15% of the sentences. Second, the
improved tagging accuracy would come at a very
heavy price in terms of ambiguity; the median
number of combined segmentation and POS tag-
ging analyses per sentence would be 1,440.
269
In contrast, machine-learned transformation
rules are an effective means to improve the out-
put of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger. Applying only
the obligatory rules that were learned already im-
proves segmented sentence accuracy from 47.15%
to 63.14% and tagged sentence accuracy from
14.07% to 27.21%, and this at no cost in terms
of ambiguity. Adding the optional rules that were
learned and hence making the rule set used for
post-processing the output of PKU’s tokenizer-
tagger non-deterministic makes it possible to im-
prove segmented sentence accuracy and tagged
sentence accuracy further to 65.06% and 31.47%
respectively, i.e. tagged sentence accuracy is more
than doubled with respect to the baseline. While
this last improvement does come at a price in
terms of ambiguity, the ambiguity resulting from
the application of the non-deterministic rule set is
very low in comparison to the ambiguity of the
output of PKU’s tokenizer-tagger in all-tags mode;
the median number of analyses per sentences only
increases to 2. Finally, it should be noted that
the transformational rules provide entirely correct
segmentation and POS tagging analyses not only
for more sentences, but also for longer sentences.
They increase the average length of a correctly
segmented sentence from 18.22 words to 21.94
words and the average length of a correctly seg-
mented and POS-tagged sentence from 9.58 words
to 16.33 words.
4 Comparison to related work and
Discussion
Comparing our results to other results in the liter-
ature is not an easy task because segmentation and
POS tagging standards vary, and our test data have
not been used for a final evaluation before. Nev-
ertheless, there are of course systems that perform
word segmentation and POS tagging for Chinese
and have been evaluated on data similar to our test
data.
Published results also vary as to the evalua-
tion measures used, in particular when it comes
to combined word segmentation and POS tag-
ging. For word segmentation considered sepa-
rately, the consensus is to use the (segmentation)
F-score (SF). The quality of systems that perform
both segmentation and POS tagging is often ex-
pressed in terms of (character) tag accuracy (TA),
but this obviously depends on the character tag-
ging scheme adopted. An alternative measure is
POS tagging F-score (TF), which is the geomet-
ric mean of precision and recall of correctly seg-
mented and POS-tagged words. Evaluation mea-
sures for the sentence level have not been given in
any publication that we are aware of, probably be-
cause segmenters and POS taggers are rarely con-
sidered as pre-processing modules for parsers, but
also because the figures for measures like sentence
accuracy are strikingly low.
For systems that perform only word segmenta-
tion, we find the following results in the literature:
(Gao et al., 2004), who use TBL to adapt a “gen-
eral purpose” segmenter to varying standards, re-
port an SF of 95.5% on PKU data and an SF of
90.4% on CTB data. (Tseng et al., 2005) achieve
an SF of 95.0%, 95.3% and 86.3% on PKU data
from the Sighan Bakeoff 2005, PKU data from
the Sighan Bakeoff 2003 and CTB data from the
Sighan Bakeoff 2003 respectively. Finally, (Zhang
et al., 2006) report an SF of 94.8% on PKU data.
For systems that perform both word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging, the following results were
published: Florian and Ngai (2001) report an SF
of 93.55% and a TA of 88.86% on CTB data.
Ng and Low (2004) report an SF of 95.2% and
a TA of 91.9% on CTB data. Finally, Zhang and
Clark (2008) achieve an SF of 95.90% and a TF
of 91.34% by 10-fold cross validation using CTB
data.
Last but not least, there are parsers that oper-
ate on characters rather than words and who per-
form segmentation and POS tagging as part of the
parsing process. Among these, we would like to
mention Luo (2003), who reports an SF 96.0%
on Chinese Treebank (CTB) data, and (Fung et
al., 2004), who achieve “a word segmentation pre-
cision/recall performance of 93/94%”. Both the
SF and the TF results achieved by our “PKU one
tag + non-deterministic rule set” setup, whose out-
put is slightly ambiguous, compare favorably with
all the results mentioned, and even the results
achieved by our “PKU one tag + deterministic rule
set” setup are competitive.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
The idea of carrying some ambiguity from one
processing step into the next in order not to prune
good solutions is not new. E.g., Prins and van No-
ord (2003) use a probabilistic part-of-speech tag-
ger that keeps multiple tags in certain cases for
a hand-crafted HPSG-inspired parser for Dutch,

Table 1: Evaluation figures achieved by four different systems on the 5,054 sentences of our test set
and Curran et al. (2006) show the benefits of us-
ing a multi-tagger rather than a single-tagger for
an induced CCG for English. However, to our
knowledge, this idea has not made its way into
the field of Chinese parsing so far. Chinese pars-
ing systems either pass on a single segmentation
and POS tagging analysis to the parser proper or
they are character-based, i.e. segmentation and
tagging are part of the parsing process. Although
several treebank-induced character-based parsers
for Chinese have achieved promising results, this
approach is impractical in the development of a
hand-crafted deep grammar like the Chinese LFG.
We therefore believe that the development of a
“multi-tokenizer-tagger” is the way to go for this
sort of system (and all systems that can handle a
certain amount of ambiguity that may or may not
be resolved at later processing stages). Our results
show that we have made an important first step in
this direction.
As to future work, we hope to resolve the prob-
lem of not having a gold standard that is seg-
mented and tagged exactly according to the guide-
lines established by the Chinese LFG developer
by semi-automatically applying the hand-crafted
transformational rules that were developed to the
PKU gold standard. We will then induce obliga-
tory and optional FST rules from this “grammar-
compliant” gold standard and hope that these will
be able to replace the hand-crafted transformation
rules currently used in the grammar. Finally, we
plan to carry out more training runs; in particu-
lar, we intend to experiment with lower accuracy
(and score) thresholds for optional rules. The idea
is to find the optimal balance between ambigu-
ity, which can probably be higher than with our
current set of induced rules without affecting ef-
ficiency too adversely, and accuracy, which still
needs further improvement, as can easily be seen
from the sentence accuracy figures.
