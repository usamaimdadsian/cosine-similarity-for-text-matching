Abstract
The task of inferring the native language of
an author based on texts written in a second
language has generally been tackled as a clas-
sification problem, typically using as features
a mix of n-grams over characters and part of
speech tags (for small and fixed n) and un-
igram function words. To capture arbitrar-
ily long n-grams that syntax-based approaches
have suggested are useful, adaptor grammars
have some promise. In this work we investi-
gate their extension to identifying n-gram col-
locations of arbitrary length over a mix of PoS
tags and words, using both maxent and in-
duced syntactic language model approaches to
classification. After presenting a new, simple
baseline, we show that learned collocations
used as features in a maxent model perform
better still, but that the story is more mixed for
the syntactic language model.
1 Introduction
The task of inferring the native language of an author
based on texts written in a second language — na-
tive language identification (NLI) — has, since the
seminal work of Koppel et al. (2005), been primarily
tackled as a text classification task using supervised
machine learning techniques. Lexical features, such
as function words, character n-grams, and part-of-
speech (PoS) n-grams, have been proven to be use-
ful in NLI (Koppel et al., 2005; Tsur and Rappoport,
2007; Estival et al., 2007). The recent work of Wong
and Dras (2011), motivated by ideas from Second
Language Acquisition (SLA), has shown that syn-
tactic features — potentially capturing syntactic er-
rors characteristic of a particular native language —
improve performance over purely lexical ones.
PoS n-grams can be leveraged to characterise sur-
face syntactic structures: in Koppel et al. (2005),
for example, ungrammatical structures were approx-
imated by rare PoS bigrams. For the purpose of NLI,
small n-gram sizes like bigram or trigram might not
suffice to capture sequences that are characteristic of
a particular native language. On the other hand, an
attempt to represent these with larger n-grams would
not just lead to feature sparsity problems, but also
computational efficiency issues. Some form of fea-
ture selection should then come into play.
Adaptor grammars (Johnson, 2010), a hierarchi-
cal non-parametric extension of PCFGs (and also in-
terpretable as an extension of LDA-based topic mod-
els), hold out some promise here. In that initial
work, Johnson’s model learnt collocations of arbi-
trary length such as gradient descent and cost func-
tion, under a topic associated with machine learning.
Hardisty et al. (2010) applied this idea to perspective
classification, learning collocations such as pales-
tinian violence and palestinian freedom, the use of
which as features was demonstrated to help the clas-
sification of texts from the Bitter Lemons corpus as
either Palestinian or Israeli perspective.
Typically in NLI and other authorship attribu-
tion tasks, the feature sets exclude content words,
to avoid unfair cues due to potentially different do-
mains of discourse. In our context, then, what we are
interested in are ‘quasi-syntactic collocations’ of ei-
ther pure PoS (e.g. NN IN NN) or a mixture of PoS
with function words (e.g. NN of NN). The partic-
ular question of interest for this paper, then, is to
699
investigate whether the power of adaptor grammars
to discover collocations — specifically, ones of ar-
bitrary length that are useful for classification — ex-
tends to features beyond the purely lexical.
We examine two different approaches in this pa-
per. We first utilise adaptor grammars for discovery
of high performing ‘quasi-syntactic collocations’ of
arbitrary length as mentioned above and use them
as classification features in a conventional maximum
entropy (maxent) model for identifying the author’s
native language. In the second approach, we adopt
a grammar induction technique to learn a grammar-
based language model in a Bayesian setting. The
grammar learned can then be used to infer the most
probable native language that a given text written
in a second language is associated with. The latter
approach is actually closer to the work of Hardisty
et al. (2010) using adaptor grammars for perspec-
tive modeling, which inspired our general approach.
This alternative approach is also similar in nature
to the work of Bo¨rschinger et al. (2011) in which
grounded learning of semantic parsers was reduced
to a grammatical inference task.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we review the existing work of NLI as well
as the mechanics of adaptor grammars along with
their applications to classification. Section 3 details
the supervised maxent classification of NLI with
collocation (n-gram) features discovered by adaptor
grammars. The language model-based classifier is
described in Section 4. Finally, we present a dis-
cussion in Section 5 and follow with concluding re-
marks.
2 Related Work
2.1 Native Language Identification
Most of the existing research treats the task of na-
tive language identification as a form of text classi-
fication deploying supervised machine learning ap-
proaches.
The earliest notable work in this classification
paradigm is that of Koppel et al. (2005) using as
features function words, character n-grams, and PoS
bigrams, together with some spelling errors. Their
experiments were conducted on English essays writ-
ten by authors whose native language one of Bulgar-
ian, Czech, French, Russian, or Spanish. The cor-
pus used is the first version of International Corpus
of Learner English (ICLE). Apart from investigating
lexical features, syntactic features (errors in particu-
lar) were highlighted by Koppel et al. (2005) as po-
tentially useful features, but they only explored this
by characterising ungrammatical structures with rare
PoS bigrams: they chose 250 rare bigrams from the
Brown corpus.
Features for this task can include content words
or not: Koppel et al. (2009), in reviewing work in
the general area of authorship attribution (including
NLI), discuss the (perhaps unreasonable) advantage
that content word features can provide, and com-
ment that consequently they “are careful . . . to dis-
tinguish results that exploit content-based features
from those that do not”. We will not be using con-
tent words as features; we therefore note only ap-
proaches to NLI that similarly do not use them.
Following Koppel et al. (2005), Tsur and Rap-
poport (2007) replicated their work and hypothe-
sised that word choices in second language writing
is highly influenced by the frequency of native lan-
guage syllables. They investigated this through mea-
suring classification performance with only charac-
ter bigrams as features.
Estival et al. (2007) tackled the broader task of
developing profiles of authors, including native lan-
guage and various other demographic and psycho-
metric author traits, across a smaller set of languages
(English, Spanish and Arabic). To this end, they de-
ployed various lexical and document structure fea-
tures.
Wong and Dras (2011), starting from the Kop-
pel et al. (2005) approach, explored the usefulness
of syntactic features in a broader sense in which
they characterised syntactic errors with cross sec-
tions of parse trees obtained from statistical parsers,
both horizontal slices of the parse trees in the form
of CFG production rules, and the feature schemata
used in discriminative parse reranking (Charniak
and Johnson, 2005); they also found that using the
top 200 PoS bigrams helped. Their results on the
second version of the ICLE corpus, across seven
languages (those of Koppel et al., plus two Orien-
tal languages, Chinese and Japanese) demonstrated
that syntactic features of these kinds lead to signifi-
cantly better performance than the Koppel et al. fea-
tures alone, with a top accuracy (on 5-fold cross-
validation) of 77.75%.
700
Subsequently, Wong et al. (2011) explored
Bayesian topic modeling (Blei et al., 2003; Griffiths
and Steyvers, 2004) as a form of feature dimension-
ality reduction technique to discover coherent latent
factors (‘topics’) that might capture predictive fea-
tures for individual native languages. Their topics,
rather than the typical word n-grams, consisted of
bigrams over (only) PoS. However, while there was
some evidence of topic cluster coherence, this did
not improve classification performance.
The work of the present paper differs in that it
uses Bayesian techniques to discover collocations of
arbitrary length for use in classification, over a mix
of both PoS and function words, rather than for use
as feature dimensionality reduction.
2.2 Adaptor Grammars
Adaptor Grammars are a non-parametric extension
to PCFGs that are associated with a Bayesian in-
ference procedure. Here we provide an informal
introduction to Adaptor Grammars; Johnson et al.
(2007) provide a definition of Adaptor Grammars as
a hierarchy of mixtures of Dirichlet (or 2-parameter
Poisson-Dirichlet) Processes to which the reader
should turn for further details.
Adaptor Grammars can be viewed as extending
PCFGs by permitting the grammar to contain an
unbounded number of productions; they are non-
parametric in the sense that the particular produc-
tions used to analyse a corpus depends on the cor-
pus itself. Because the set of possible productions
is unbounded, they cannot be specified by simply
enumerating them, as is standard with PCFGs. In-
stead, the productions used in an adaptor gram-
mar are specified indirectly using a base grammar:
the subtrees of the base grammar’s “adapted non-
terminals” serve as the possible productions of the
adaptor grammar (Johnson et al., 2007), much in
the way that subtrees function as productions in Tree
Substitution Grammars .1
Another way to view Adaptor Grammars is that
they relax the independence assumptions associated
with PCFGs. In a PCFG productions are gener-
ated independently conditioned on the parent non-
terminal, while in an Adaptor Grammar the proba-
bility of generating a subtree rooted in an adapted
1For computational efficiency reasons Adaptor Grammars
require the subtrees to completely expand to terminals. The
Fragment Grammars of O’Donnell (2011) lift this restriction.
non-terminal is roughly proportional to the number
of times it has been previously generated (a certain
amount of mass is reserved to generate “new” sub-
trees). This means that the distribution generated by
an Adaptor Grammar “adapts” based on the corpus
being generated.
2.2.1 Mechanics of adaptor grammars
Adaptor Grammars are specified by a PCFG G,
plus a subset of G’s non-terminals that are called
the adapted non-terminals, as well as a discount
parameter aA, where 0 ? aA < 1 and a con-
centration parameter bA, where b > ?a, for each
adapted non-terminal A. An adaptor grammar de-
fines a two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet Process for
each adapted non-terminal A governed by the pa-
rameters aA and bA. For computational purposes it
is convenient to integrate out the Poisson-Dirichlet
Process, resulting in a predictive distribution spec-
ified by a Pitman-Yor Process (PYP). A PYP can
be understood in terms of a “Chinese Restaurant”
metaphor in which “customers” (observations) are
seated at “tables”, each of which is labelled with a
sample from a “base distribution” (Pitman and Yor,
1997).
In an Adaptor Grammar, unadapted non-terminals
expand just as they do in a PCFG; a production r ex-
panding the non-terminal is selected according to the
multinomial distribution ?r over productions speci-
fied in the grammar. Each adapted non-terminalA is
associated with its own Chinese Restaurant, where
the tables are labelled with subtrees generated by
the grammar rooted in A. In the Chinese Restau-
rant metaphor, the customers are expansions of A,
each table corresponds to a particular subtree ex-
panding A, and the PCFG specifies the base distri-
bution for each of the adapted non-terminals. An
adapted non-terminal A expands as follows. A ex-
pands to a subtree t with probability proportional to
nt, where nt is the number of times t has been pre-
viously generated. In addition, A expands using a
PCFG rule r expanding A with probability propor-
tional to (mA aA + bA) ?r, where mA is the number
of subtrees expanding A (i.e., the number of tables
in A’s restaurant). Because the underlying Pitman-
Yor Processes have a “rich get richer” property, they
generate power-law distributions over the subtrees
for adapted non-terminals.
701
2.2.2 Adaptor grammars as LDA extension
With the ability to rewrite non-terminals to en-
tire subtrees, adaptor grammars have been used to
extend unigram-based LDA topic models (Johnson,
2010). This allows topic models to capture se-
quences of words with abitrary length rather than
just unigrams of word. It has also been shown that it
is crucial to go beyond the bag-of-words assump-
tion as topical collocations capture more meaning
information and represent more interpretable topics
(Wang et al., 2007).
Taking the PCFG formulation for the LDA topic
models, it can be modified such that each topic
Topici generates sequences of words by adapting
each of the Topici non-terminals (usually indicated
with an underline in an adaptor grammar). The over-
all schema for capturing topical collocations with an
adaptor grammar is as follows:
Sentence? Docj j ? 1, . . . ,m
Docj ? j j ? 1, . . . ,m
Docj ? Docj Topici i ? 1, . . . , t;
j ? 1, . . . ,m
Topici ?Words i ? 1, . . . , t
Words?Word
Words?Words Word
Word? w w ? V
There is a non-grammar-based approach to find-
ing topical collocations as demonstrated by Wang et
al. (2007). Both of these approaches learned use-
ful collocations: for instance, as mentioned in Sec-
tion 1, Johnson (2010) found collocations such gra-
dient descent and cost function associated with the
topic of machine learning; Wang et al. (2007) found
the topic of human receptive system comprises of
collocations such as visual cortext and motion de-
tector.
Adaptor grammars have also been deployed as a
form of feature selection in discovering useful collo-
cations for perspective classification. Hardisty et al.
(2010) argued that indicators of perspectives are of-
ten beyond the length of bigrams and demonstrated
that the use of the adaptor grammar inferred n-grams
of arbitrary length as features establishes the start-
of-the-art performance for perspective classification
on the Bitter Lemons corpus, depicting two differ-
ent perspectives of Israeli and Pelestinian. We are
adopting a similar approach in this paper for classi-
fying texts with respect to the author’s native lan-
guage; but the key difference with Hardisty et al.
(2010)’s approach is that our focus is on collocations
that mix PoS and lexical elements, rather than being
purely lexical.
3 Maxent Classification
In this section, we first explain the procedures taken
to set up the conventional supervised classification
task for NLI through the deployment of adaptor
grammars for discovery of ‘quasi-syntactic colloca-
tions’ of arbitrary length. We then present the classi-
fication results attained based on these selected sets
of n-gram features. In all of our experiments, we
investigate two sets of collocations: pure PoS and
a mixture of PoS and function words. The idea of
examining the latter set is motivated by the results
of Wong and Dras (2011) where inclusion of parse
production rules lexicalised with function words as
features had shown to improve the classification per-
formance relative to unlexicalised ones.
3.1 Experimental Setup
3.1.1 Data and evaluation
The classification experiments are conducted on
the second version of ICLE (Granger et al., 2009).2
Following our earlier NLI work in Wong and Dras
(2011), our data set consists of 490 texts written
in English by authors of seven different native lan-
guage groups: Bulgarian, Czech, French, Russian,
Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese. Each native lan-
guage contributes 70 out of the 490 texts. As we are
using a relative small data set, we perform k-fold
cross-validation, choosing k = 5.
3.1.2 Adaptor grammars for supervised
classification
We derive two adaptor grammars for the maxent
classification setting, where each is associated with
a different set of vocabulary (i.e. either pure PoS
or the mixture of PoS and function words). We use
2Joel Tetreault and Daniel Blanchard from ETS have pointed
out (personal communication) that there is a subtle issue with
ICLE that could have an impact on the classification perfor-
mance of NLI tasks; in particular, when character n-grams are
used as features, some special characters used in some ICLE
texts might affect performance. For our case, this should not be
of much issue since they will not appear in our collocations.
702
the grammar of Johnson (2010) as presented in Sec-
tion 2.2.2, except that the vocabulary differs: either
w ? Vpos or w ? Vpos+fw. For Vpos, there are
119 distinct PoS tags based on the Brown tagset.
Vpos+fw is extended with 398 function words as per
Wong and Dras (2011). m = 490 is the number of
documents, and t = 25 the number of topics (chosen
as the best performing one from Wong et al. (2011)).
Rules of the form Docj ? Docj Topici that
encode the possible topics that are associated with
a document j are given similar ? priors as used
in LDA (? = 5/t where t = 25 in our experi-
ments). Likewise, similar ? priors from LDA are
placed on the adapted rules expanding from Topici
? Words, representing the possible sequences of
words that each topic comprises (? = 0.01).3 The
inference algorithm for the adaptor grammars are
based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique
made available online by Johnson (2010).4
3.1.3 Classification models with n-gram
features
Based on the two adaptor grammars inferred, the
resulting collocations (n-grams) are extracted as fea-
tures for the classification task of identifying au-
thors’ native language. These n-grams found by the
adaptor grammars are only a (not necessarily proper)
subset of those n-grams that are strongly characteris-
tic of a particular native language. In principle, one
could find all strongly characteristic n-grams by enu-
merating all the possible instances of n-grams up to
a given length if the vocabulary is of a small enough
closed set, such as for PoS tags, but this is infeasi-
ble when the set is extended to PoS plus function
words. The use of adaptor grammars here can be
viewed as a form of feature selection, as in Hardisty
et al. (2010).
Baseline models To serve as a baseline, we take
the commonly used PoS bigrams as per the previ-
ous work of NLI (Koppel et al., 2005). A set of
200 PoS bigrams is selected in two ways: the 200
most frequent in the training data (as in Wong and
Dras (2011)) and the 200 with the highest informa-
tion gain (IG) values in the training data (not evalu-

values presented in Wong et al. (2011).

ated in other work).
Enumerated n-gram models Here, we enumer-
ate all the possible n-grams up to a fixed length and
select the best of these according to IG, as a general-
isation of the baseline. The first motivation for this
feature set is that, in a sense, this should give a rough
upper bound for the adaptor grammar’s PoS-alone n-
grams, as these latter should most often be a subset
of the former. The second motivation is that it gives
a robust comparison for the mixed PoS and function
word n-grams, where it is infeasible to enumerate all
of them.
ENUM-POS We enumerate all possible n-grams up
to the length of 5, and select those that actually
occur (i.e. of the
?5
i=1 119
i possible n-grams,
this is 218,042 based on the average of 5 folds).
We look at the top n-grams up to length 5 selected
by IG: the top 2,800 and the top 6,500 (for com-
parability with adaptor grammar feature sets, be-
low), as well as the top 10,000 and the top 20,000
(to study the effect of larger feature space).
Adaptor grammar n-gram models The classifi-
cation features are the two sets of selected colloca-
tions inferred by the adaptor grammars which are the
main interest of this paper.
AG-POS This first set of the adaptor grammar-
inferred features comprise of pure PoS n-grams
(i.e. Vpos). The largest length of n-gram found
is 17, but about 97% of the collocations are of
length between 2 to 5. We investigate three vari-
ants of this feature set: top 200 n-grams of all
lengths (based on IG), all n-grams of all lengths
(n = 2, 795 on average), and all n-grams up to
the length of 5 (n = 2, 710 on average).
AG-POS+FW This second set of the adaptor
grammar-inferred features are mixtures of PoS
and function words (i.e. Vpos+fw). The largest
length of n-gram found for this set is 19 and
the total number of different collocations found
is much higher. For the purpose of comparabil-
ity with the first set of adaptor grammar features,
we investigate the following five variants for this
feature set: top 200 n-grams of all lengths, all n-
grams of all lengths (n = 6, 490 on average), all
n-grams up to the length of 5 (n = 6, 417 on av-
erage), top 2,800 n-grams of all different lengths,

and top 2,800 n-grams up to the length of 5. (All
the selections are based on IG).
In our models, all feature values are of binary
type. For the classifier, we employ a maximum en-
tropy (MaxEnt) machine learner — MegaM (fifth re-
lease) by Hal Daume´ III.5
3.2 Classification results
Table 1 presents all the classification results for the
individual feature sets, along with the baselines. On
the whole, both sets of the collocations inferred by
the adaptor grammars perform better than the two
baselines. We make the following observations:
• Regarding ENUM-POS as a (rough) upper
bound, the adaptor grammar AG-POS with a
comparable number of features performs al-
most as well. However, because it is possible to
enumerate many more n-grams than are found
during the sampling process, ENUM-POS opens
up a gap over AG-POS of around 4%.
• Collocations with a mix of PoS and function
words do in fact lead to higher accuracy as
compared to those of pure PoS (except for the
top 200 n-grams); for instance, compare the
2,800 n-grams up to length 5 from the two cor-
responding sets (71.84 vs. 68.57).

collocations with mixtures of PoS and function

words (AG-POS+FW) in general perform better
than our rough upper bound of PoS colloca-
tions, i.e. the enumerated PoS n-grams (ENUM-
POS): the overall best results of the two feature
sets are 74.49 and 72.44 respectively.
Given that the AG-POS+FW n-grams are captur-
ing different sorts of document characteristics, they
could potentially usefully be combined with the
PoS-alone features. We thus combined them with
both AG-POS and ENUM-POS feature sets, and the
classification results are presented in Table 2. We
tried two ways of integrating the feature sets: one
way is to take the overall top 2,800 of the two sets
based on IG; the other way is to just combine the two
sets of features by concatenation of feature vectors
(as indicated by a and b respectively in the result
table). For comparability purposes, we considered
only n-grams up to the length of 5. A baseline ap-
proach to this is just to add in function words as un-
igram features by feature vector concatenation, giv-
ing two further models, AG-POS [all ? 5-gram] &
FW and ENUM-POS [top2800 ? 5-gram] & FW.
Overall, the classification accuracies attained by
the combined feature sets are higher than the in-
dividual feature sets. The best performing of all
the models is achieved by combining the mixed
PoS and function word collocations with the adap-
tor grammar-inferred PoS, producing the best accu-
racy thus far of 75.71. This demonstrates that fea-
tures inferred by adaptor grammars do capture some
useful information and function words are playing
a role. The way of integrating the two feature sets
has different effects on the types of combination. As
seen in Table 2, method a works better for the com-
704
bination of the two adaptor grammar feature sets;
whereas method b works better for combining adap-
tor grammar features with enumerated n-gram fea-
tures.
Using adaptor grammar collocations also outper-
forms the alternative baseline of adding in function
words as unigrams. For instance, the best perform-
ing combined feature set of both AG-POS and AG-
POS+FW does result in higher accuracy as compared
to the two alternative baseline models, comparing
75.71 with 72.04 (and 75.71 with 73.67). This
demonstrates that our more general PoS plus func-
tion word collocations derived from adaptor gram-
mars are indeed useful, and supports the argument
of Wang et al. (2007) that they are a useful tech-
nique for looking into features beyond just the bag
of words.
4 Language Model-based Classification
In this section, we take a language modeling ap-
proach to native language identification; the idea
here is to adopt grammatical inference to learn
a grammar-based language model to represent the
texts written by non-English native users. The gram-
mar learned is then used to predict the most probable
native language that a document (a sentence) is as-
sociated with.
In a sense, we are using a parser-based language
model to rank the documents with respect to native
language. We draw on the work of Bo¨rschinger et
al. (2011) for this section. In that work, the task
was grounded learning of a semantic parser. Train-
ing examples there consisted of natural language
strings (descriptions of a robot soccer game) and
a set of candidate meanings (actions in the robot
soccer game world) for the string; each was tagged
with a context identifier reflecting the actual action
of the game. A grammar was then induced that
would parse the examples, and was used on test data
(where the context identifier was absent) to predict
the context. We take a similar approach to devel-
oping an grammatical induction technique, although
where they used a standard LDA topic model-based
PCFG, we use an adaptor grammar. We expect that
the results will likely to be lower than for the dis-
criminative approach of Section 3. However, the
approach is of interest for a few reasons: because,
whereas the adaptor grammar plays an ancillary, fea-
ture selection role in Section 3, here the feature se-
lection is an organic part of the approach as per the
actual implementation of Hardisty et al. (2010); be-
cause adaptor grammars can potentially be extended
in a natural way with unlabelled data; and because,
for the purposes of this paper, it constitutes a second,
quite different way to evaluate the use of n-gram col-
locations.
4.1 Language Models
We derive two adaptor grammar-based language
models. One consists of only unigrams and bi-
grams, and the other finds n-gram collocations, in
both cases over either PoS or the mix of PoS and
function words. The assumption that we make is that
each document (each sentence) is a mixture of two
sets of topics: one is the native language-specific
topic (i.e. characteristic of the native language) and
the other is the generic topic (i.e. characteristic of
the second language — English in our case). The
generic topic is thus shared across all languages,
and will behave quite differently from a language-
specific topic, which is not shared. In other words,
there are eight topics, representing seven native lan-
guage groups that are of interest (Bulgarian, Czech,
French, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese)
and the second language English itself.6
Bigram models The following rule schema is
applicable to both vocabulary types of PoS and the
mixture of PoS and function words.
Root? lang langTopics
langTopics? langTopics langTopic

N-gram models The grammar is the same as
the above with the exception that the non-terminal
Words is now rewritten as follows in order to

adaptor grammar, by taking as terminals all pairs of PoS tags.

capture n-gram collocations of arbitrary length.
Words?Words Word
Words?Word
It should be noted that the two grammars above
can in theory be applied to an entire document or on
individual sentences. For this present work, we work
on the sentence level as the run-time of the current
implementation of the adaptor grammars grows pro-
portional to the cube of the sentence length. For each
grammar we try both sparse and uniform Dirichlet
priors (? = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0}). The sparse priors en-
courage only a minority of the rules to be associated
with high probabilities.
4.2 Training and Evaluation
As we are using the same data set as per the pre-
vious approach, we perform 5-fold cross validation
as well. However, the training for each fold is con-
ducted with a different grammar consisting of only
the vocabulary that occur in each training fold. The
reason is that we are now having a form of super-
vised topic models where the learning process is
guided by the native languages. Hence, each of the
training sentences are prefixed with the (native) lan-
guage identifiers lang, as seen in the Root rules of
the grammar presented above.
To evaluate the grammars learned, as in
Bo¨rschinger et al. (2011) we need to slightly modify
the grammars above by removing the language iden-
tifiers ( lang) from theRoot rules and then parse the
unlabeled sentences using a publicly available CKY
parser.7 The predicted native language is inferred
from the parse output by reading off the langTopics
that the Root is rewritten to. We take that as the
most probable native language for a particular test
sentence. At the document level, we select as the
class the language predicted for the largest number
of sentences in that document.
4.3 Parsing Results
Tables 3 and 4 present the parsing results at the sen-
tence level and the document level, respectively. On
the whole, the results at the sentence level are much
poorer as compared to those at the document level.
In light of the results of Section 3.2, it is surprising

that bigram models appear to perform better than n-
gram models for both types of vocabulary, with the
exception of AG-POS+FW at the document level. In
fact, one would expect n-gram models to perform
better in general as it is a generalisation that would
contain all the potential bigrams. Nonetheless, the
language models over the mixture of PoS and func-
tion words appear to be a more suitable representa-
tive of our learner corpus as compared to those over
purely PoS, confirming the usefulness of integrated
function words for the NLI classification task.
It should also be noted that sparse priors gen-
erally appear to be more appriopriate; except that
for AG-POS+FW n-grams, uniform priors are indeed
better and resulted in the highest parsing result of
50.15. (Although all the parsing results are much
weaker as compared to the results presented in Sec-
tion 3.2, they are all higher than the majority base-
line of 14.29% i.e. 70/490).
5 Discussion
Here we take a closer look at how well each ap-
proach does in identifying the individual native lan-
guages. The confusion matrix for the best model
of two approaches are presented in Table 5 and Ta-
ble 6. Both approaches perform reasonably well for
the two Oriental languages (Chinese in particular);
this is not a major surprise, as the two languages
are not part of the language family that the rest of
the languages come from (i.e. Indo-European). Un-
der the supervised maxent classification, misclassi-
fications largely are observed in the Romance ones
(French and Spanish) as well as Russian; for the lan-
guage model-based approach, Bulgarian is identi-

fied poorly, and Spanish moreso. However, the latter
approach appears to be better in identifying Czech.
On the whole, the maxent approach results in much
fewer misclassifications compared to its counterpart.
In fact, there is a subtle difference in the exper-
imental setting of the models derived from the two
approaches with respect to the adaptor grammar: the
number of topics. Under the maxent setting, the
number of topics t was set to 25, while we restricted
the models with the language modeling approach to
only eight topics (seven for the individual native lan-
guages and one for the common second language,
English). Looking more deeply into the topics them-
selves reveals that there appears to be at least two out
of the 25 topics (from the supervised models) asso-
ciated with n-grams that are indicative of the native
languages, taking Chinese and Japanese as examples
(see the associated topics in Table 7).8 Perhaps as-
sociating each native language with only one gener-
alised topic is not sufficient.
Furthermore, the distribution of n-grams among
the topics (i.e. subtrees of collocations derived
from the adaptor grammars) are quite different be-
tween the two approaches although the total num-
8Taking the examples from Wong et al. (2011) as reference,
we found similar n-grams that are indicative of Japanese and
Chinese.

ber of n-grams inferred by each approach is about
the same. For the language modeling ones, a high
number of n-grams were associated with the generic
topic nullTopic9 and each language-specific topic
langTopic has a lower number of n-grams relative
to bi-grams (Table 8) associated with it. For the
maxent models, in contrast, the majority of the top-
ics were associated with a higher number of n-grams
(Table 9). The smaller number of n-grams to be used
as features — and the fact that their extra length
means that they will occur more sparsely in the doc-
uments — seems to be the core of the problem.
Nonetheless, the language models inferred dis-
cover relevant n-grams that are representative of
individual native languages. For instance, the bi-
gram NN NN, which Wong and Dras (2011) claim
may reflect the error of determiner-noun disagree-
ment commonly found amongst Chinese learners,
was found under the Chinese topic at the top-2 posi-
tion with a probability of 0.052 as compared to the
other languages at the probability range of 0.0005-
0.003. Similarly, one example for Japanese, the mix-
ture bigram PPSS think, indicating frequent us-
age of pronouns within Japanese was seen under the
Japanese topic at the top-9 position with a probabil-
ity of 0.025 in relation to other languages within the
range of 0.0002-0.006: this phenomenon as char-

structures that are representative of native English speakers that
are shared by non-native speakers.

with three additional topics that represent the lan-

grammar is presented as below.) However, the pars-

6 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper has shown that the extension of adap-
tor grammars to discovering collocations beyond the
lexical, in particular a mix of PoS tags and function
words, can produce features useful in the NLI clas-
sification problem. More specifically, when added
to a new baseline presented in this paper, the com-
bined feature set of both types of adaptor grammar
inferred collocations produces the best result in the
context of using n-grams for NLI. The usefulness of
the collocations does vary, however, with the tech-
nique used for classification.
Future work will involve a broader exploration
of the parameter space of the adaptor grammars,
in particular the number of topics and the value
of ?; a look at other non-parametric extensions of
PCFGs, such as infinite PCFGs (Liang et al., 2007)
for finding a set of non-terminals permitting more
fine-grained topics; and an investigation of how the
approach can be extended to semi-supervised learn-
ing to take advantage of the vast quantity of texts
with errors available on the Web.
