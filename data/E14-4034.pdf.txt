Abstract
In this paper, we present a simple ap-
proach for consistent training of hierarchi-
cal phrase-based translation models. In
order to consistently train a translation
model, we perform hierarchical phrase-
based decoding on training data to find
derivations between the source and tar-
get sentences. This is done by syn-
chronous parsing the given sentence pairs.
After extracting k-best derivations, we
reestimate the translation model proba-
bilities based on collected rule counts.
We show the effectiveness of our proce-
dure on the IWSLT German?English and
English?French translation tasks. Our
results show improvements of up to 1.6
points BLEU.
1 Introduction
In state of the art statistical machine translation
systems, the translation model is estimated by fol-
lowing heuristic: Given bilingual training data,
a word alignment is trained with tools such as
GIZA
++
(Och and Ney, 2003) or fast align (Dyer
et al., 2013). Then, all valid translation pairs are
extracted and the translation probabilities are com-
puted as relative frequencies (Koehn et al., 2003).
However, this extraction method causes several
problems. First, this approach does not consider,
whether a translation pair is extracted from a likely
alignment or not. Further, during the extraction
process, models employed in decoding are not
considered.
For phrase-based translation, a successful ap-
proach addressing these issues is presented in
(Wuebker et al., 2010). By applying a phrase-
based decoder on the source sentences of the train-
ing data and constraining the translations to the
corresponding target sentences, k-best segmenta-
tions are produced. Then, the phrases used for
these segmentations are extracted and counted.
Based on the counts, the translation model prob-
abilities are recomputed. To avoid over-fitting,
leave-one-out is applied.
However, for hierarchical phrase-based transla-
tion an equivalent approach is still missing.
In this paper, we present a simple and effec-
tive approach for consistent reestimation of the
translation model probabilities in a hierarchical
phrase-based translation setup. Using a heuristi-
cally extracted translation model as starting point,
the training data are parsed bilingually. From the
resulting hypergraphs, we extract k-best deriva-
tions and the rules applied in each derivation. This
is done with a top-down k-best parsing algorithm.
Finally, the translation model probabilities are re-
computed based on the counts of the extracted
rules. In our procedure, we employ leave-one-out
to avoid over-fitting. Further, we consider all mod-
els which are used in translation to ensure a con-
sistent training.
Experimental results are presented on the
German?English and English?French IWSLT
shared machine translation task (Cettolo et al.,
2013). We are able to gain improvements of up to
1.6% BLEU absolute and 1.4% TER over a com-
petitive baseline. On all tasks and test sets, the
improvements are statistically significant with at
least 99% confidence.
The paper is structured as follow. First, we re-
vise the state of the art hierarchical phrase-based
extraction and translation process. In Section 3,
we propose our training procedure. Finally, ex-
perimental results are given in Section 4 and we
conclude with Section 5.
2 Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation
In hierarchical phrase-based translation (Chiang,
2005), discontinuous phrases with “gaps” are
allowed. The translation model is formalized
as a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG)
174
and consists of bilingual rules, which are based
on bilingual standard phrases and discontinuous
phrases. Each bilingual rule rewrites a generic
non-terminal X into a pair of strings
˜
f and e˜
with both terminals and non-terminals in both lan-
guages
X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?. (1)
In a standard hierarchical phrase-based translation
setup, obtaining these rules is based on a heuristic
extraction from automatically word-aligned bilin-
gual training data. Just like in the phrase-based
approach, all bilingual rules of a sentence pair
are extracted given an alignment. The standard
phrases are stored as lexical rules in the rule set.
In addition, whenever a phrase contains a sub-
phrase, this sub-phrase is replaced by a generic
non-terminal X . With these hierarchical phrases
we can define the hierarchical rules in the SCFG.
The rule probabilities which are in general defined
as relative frequencies are computed based on the
joint counts C(X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?) of a bilingual rule
X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?
p
H
(
˜
f |e˜) =
C(X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?)
?
˜
f
?
C(X ? ?
˜
f
?
, e˜?)
. (2)
The translation probabilities are computed in
source-to-target as well as in target-to-source di-
rection. In the translation processes, these proba-
bilities are integrated in the log-linear combination
among other models such as a language model,
word lexicon models, word and phrase penalty and
binary features marking hierarchical phrases, glue
rule and rules with non-terminals at the bound-
aries.
The translation process of hierarchical phrase-
based approach can be considered as parsing prob-
lem. Given an input sentence in the source lan-
guage, this sentence is parsed using the source lan-
guage part of the SCFG. In this work, we perform
this step with a modified version of the CYK+ al-
gorithm (Chappelier and Rajman, 1998). The out-
put of this algorithm is a hypergraph, which rep-
resents all possible derivations of the input sen-
tence. A derivation represents an application of
rules from the grammar to generate the given in-
put sentence. Using the the associated target part
of the applied rule, for each derivation a transla-
tion can be constructed. In a second step, the lan-
guage model score is incorporated. Given the hy-
pergraph, this is done with the cube pruning algo-
rithm presented in (Chiang, 2007).
3 Translation Model Training
We propose following pipeline for consistent hi-
erarchical phrase-based training: First we train a
word alignment, from which the baseline trans-
lation model is extracted as described in the pre-
vious section. The log-linear parameter weights
are tuned with MERT (Och, 2003) on a develop-
ment set to produce the baseline system. Next,
we perform decoding on the training data. As the
translations are constrained to the given target sen-
tences, we name this step forced decoding in the
following. Details are given in the next subsection.
Given the counts C
FD
(X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?) of the rules,
which have been applied in the forced decoding
step, the translation probabilities p
FD
(
˜
f |e˜) for the
translation model are recomputed:
p
FD
(
˜
f |e˜) =
C
FD
(X ? ?
˜
f, e˜?)
?
˜
f
?
C
FD
(X ? ?
˜
f
?
, e˜?)
. (3)
Finally, using the translation model with the
reestimated probabilities, we retune the log-linear
parameter weights and obtain our final system.
3.1 Forced Decoding
In this section, we describe the forced decoding
for hierarchical phrase-based translation in detail.
Given a sentence pair of the training data, we
constrain the translation of the source sentence to
produce the corresponding target sentence. For
this constrained decoding process, the language
model score is constant as the translation is fixed.
Hence, the incorporation of the a language model
is not needed. This results in a simplification of
the decoding process as we do not have to employ
the cube pruning algorithm as described in the pre-
vious section. Consequently, forced decoding for
hierarchical phrase-based translation is equivalent
to synchronous parsing of the training data. Dyer
(2010) has described an approach to reduce the
average-case run-time of synchronous parsing by
splitting one bilingual parse into two successive
monolingual parses. We adopt this method and
first parse the source sentence and then the target
sentence with CYK+.
If the given sentence pair has been parsed suc-
cessfully, we employ a top-down k-best parsing
algorithm (Chiang and Huang, 2005) on the re-
sulting hypergraph to find the k-best derivations
between the given source and target sentence. In
this step, all models of the translation process are
175
included (except for the language model). Further,
leave-one-out is applied to counteract overfitting.
Note, that the model weights of the baseline sys-
tem are used to perform forced decoding.
Finally, we extract and count the rules which
have been applied in the derivations. These counts
are used to recompute the translation probabilities.
3.2 Recombination
In standard hierarchical phrase-based decoding,
partial derivations that are indistinguishable from
each other are recombined. In (Huck et al., 2013)
two schemes are presented. Either derivations that
produce identical translations or derivations with
identical language model context are recombined.
As in forced decoding the translation is fixed and
a language model is missing, both schemes are not
suitable.
However, a recombination scheme is necessary
to avoid derivations with the same application
of rules. Further, recombining such derivations
increases simultaneously the amounts of consid-
ered derivations during k-best parsing. Given two
derivations with the same set of applied rules, the
order of application of the rules may be different.
Thus, we propose following scheme for recom-
bining derivations in forced decoding: Derivations
that produce identical sets of applied rules are re-
combined. Figure 1 shows an example for k = 3.
Employing the proposed scheme, derivations d
1
and d
2
are recombined since both share the same
set of applied rules ({r

data of the IWSLT 2013 German?English and
English?French task.
It is focusing the translation of TED talks. Bilin-
gual data statistics are given in Table 1. The base-
line system was trained on all available bilingual
data and used a 4-gram LM with modified Kneser-
Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995; Chen and
Goodman, 1998), trained with the SRILM toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002). As additional data sources for the
LM we selected parts of the Shuffled News and
LDC English Gigaword corpora based on cross-
entropy difference (Moore and Lewis, 2010). In
all experiments, the hierarchical search was per-
formed as described in Section 2.
To confirm the efficacy of our approach, addi-
tional experiments were run on the IWSLT 2013
English?French task. Statistics are given in Ta-
ble 1.
The training pipeline was set up as described
in the previous section. Tuning of the log-linear
parameter weights was done with MERT on a pro-
vided development set. As optimization criterion
we used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001).
Forced decoding was performed on the TED
talks portion of the training data (?140K sen-
tences). In both tasks, around 5% of the sentences
could not be parsed. In this work, we just skipped
those sentences.
We report results in BLEU [%] and TER [%]
(Snover et al., 2006). All reported results are av-
erages over three independent MERT runs, and
we evaluated statistical significance with MultE-
val (Clark et al., 2011).
4.2 Results
Figure 2 shows the performance of setups us-
ing translation models with reestimated translation
probabilities. The setups vary in the k-best deriva-
tion size extracted in the forced decoding (fd) step.
Based on the performance on the development set,
we selected two setups with k = 500 using leave-
one-out (+l1o) and k = 750 without leave-one-
out (-l1o). Table 2 shows the final results for
the German?English task. Performing consistent
translation model training improves the translation

quality on all test sets significantly. We gain an
improvement of up to 0.7 points in BLEU and 0.9
points in TER. Applying leave-one-out results in
an additional improvement by up to 0.4 % BLEU
and 0.5 % TER. The results for English?French
are given in Table 3. We observe a similar im-
provement by up to 1.6 % BLEU and 1.1 % TER.
The improvements could be the effect of do-
main adaptation since we performed forced decod-
ing on the TED talks portion of the training data.
Thus, rules which were applied to decode the in-
domain data might get higher translation probabil-
ities.
Furthermore, employing leave-one-out seems to
avoid overfitting as the average source rule length
in training is reduced from 5.0 to 3.5 (k = 500).
5 Conclusion
We have presented a simple and effective approach
for consistent training of hierarchical phrase-based
translation models. By reducing hierarchical de-
coding on parallel training data to synchronous
parsing, we were able to reestimate the trans-
lation probabilities including all models applied
during the translation process. On the IWSLT
German?English and English?French tasks, the
final results show statistically significant improve-
ments of up to 1.6 points in BLEU and 1.4 points
in TER.
