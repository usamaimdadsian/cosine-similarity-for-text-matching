ABSTRACT 
There have been various attempts at 
using the sublanguage notion for disambi- 
guation and the selection of target language 
equivalents in machine translation. In this 
paper a theoretical concept and its imple- 
mentation in a real MT application are pre- 
sented. Above this, means of linguistic 
engineering like weighting mechanisms are 
proposed. 
INTRODUCTION 
It has been proposed by a number of 
authors (cf. Kittredge 1987, Kittredge/Lehr- 
berger 1982, Luckhardt 1984) to use the 
sublanguage notion for solving some of the 
notorious problems in machine translation 
(MT) such as disambiguation a d selection 
of target language quivalents. 
In the following, I shall give a rough 
summary of what sublanguages can contri- 
bute to the solution of concrete MT pro- 
blems. 
A SUBLANGUAGE CONCEPT FOR 
USE IN MT SYSTEMS 
To my knowledge, it was Z. Harris 
who introduced the term 'sublanguage' (cf. 
Harris 1968, 152) for a portion of natural 
language differing from other portions of 
the same language syntactically and/or 
lexically. Definitions are gwen by 
Hirschman/Sager (1982), Quinlan (1989) 
and Lehrberger (1982). 
In order to be able to use such 
characterizations in MT, they have to be 
formalized in a way adequate to the MT 
system in question. Such formalizable 
properties were combined in the definition 
of Luckhardt (1984) of what sublanguage 
can mean for MT: 
Text type represents the 
syntactic-syntagmatic level of a sublangua- 
ge for which only a rather weak 
differentiation can be proposed (e.g. running 
text, word list, nominal structures etc.). 
Subiect field represents the lexical 
level of a sublanguage, i.e. for every 
sublanguage a subject field is determined as 
being characteristic, so that the MT system 
may choose on the basis of the sublanguage 
of a text those translation equivalents from 
the lexicon which carry the same subject 
field code as the translated text. 
The lack of a commonly accepted 
subject field classification for MT Is a 
serious problem. Such a classification is 
tentatively proposed in Luckhardt/Zimmer- 
mann 1991. 
T~xt function represents the lexical- 
pragmatic level. The function of a text (or 
its target group) may determine the choice 
of TL equivalents and of syntactic structure 
or style. 
The inhouse usage criterion covers a 
number of aspects determined by special 
requests of the MT user or the firm ordering 
the translation. This is first of all a question 
of inhouse terminology. 
SUBLANGUAGES FOR MT: 
MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS 
A typical maintenance r quirement card of 
the Bundessprachenamt (Federal Translati- 
ons Agency) among others contains the fol- 
lowing parts: 
. 0esignation ofeauipment 
text type 'nominal structure' 
text function 'title' 
e.g.: 'Portable gasoline driven pump' 
. tools, parts, material~ 
text type 'word list' 
text function 'accessories'; e.g.: 
- key set, head screw, L-type hex 
- wrench, adjustable, open end 6" 
- solvent, type II 
- screwdriver, flat tip, medium duty 
- rags, wiping 
- 306 - 
3. the basis of word order: orocedure 
text type 'instructions' 
(imperative style) 
text function 'maintenance 
instructions', e.g.: 
'Accomplish annually or when directed 
as a result of operational test. Clean and 
inspect fuel filter and float valve; 
- remove pump housing covers, if applicable 
- observe no smoking regulation 
- remove choke knob and fuel connection 
- remove float chamber and gasket 
- clean all parts in solvent, allow to air dry 
- inspect filter for clogging, 
tears, and deterioration' 
(cf. Wilms 1983) 
The example indicates how nicely the 
different sublanguages of this type of 
document can be differentiated, and it 
ought to be possible in all MT systems to 
capture these differences, especially the 
typical 'imperative style' of the text type 
'instructions'. In order to achieve this it 
must be possible to weight rules or 
resulting structures like in the SUSY 
system (cf. Thiel 1987). This is important, 
because there is no absolute certainty that 
all predicate structures appear as 
imperatives in English or as infinitives in 
German. 
THE USE OF SUBLANGUAGES IN THE 
STS PROJECT AND SYSTEM 
Since 1985 the SUSY system has been 
used as the core MT system within the 
computer-aided Saarbriicken Translation 
System (STS), i.e. in human-aided MT 
and in machine-aided human translation. 
Titles of scientific papers from German 
databases were machine-translated and 
postedited by humans, abstracts were 
translated by translators (in all around 5 
million words), with the MT system 
automatically supplying the correct 
terminology (from a terminology pool of 
more than 350.000 German-English entries). 
In the following a specific aspect of 
sublanguage-dependent disambiguation is 
described. 
SEMANTICS OF PREPOSITIONS IN 
TITLES 
• Highly ambiguous prepositions like 'zu', 
'fiber' etc. can be safely disambiguated on 
'Zur Optimierung von Waldschadenserhe, 
bungen' => 'The optimization of wood 
damage surveys' 
'Zur Riickgewinnung yon W~rn¢ 
verpflichtet' => 'Obliged to recover heat' 
'Technologien zur Verminderung von 
Abf'allen' => 'Technologies for the 
reduction of waste' 
'Uber Arbeit und Umwelt' => 'Labour and 
environment' 
A 'zu'-phrase at the beginning of a title (the 
top node of the nominal structure) always 
denotes a TOPIC (lst example), otherwise 
(3rd example) a purpose. 'Uber' at the 
beginning also denotes a TOPIC. These 
rules only apply, if the PP is not embedded 
in a predicate structure like in the 2nd 
example, where it fills the zu-valency of 
'verpflichtet'. So, if the parser produces a 
structure like the following: 
SUBJECT: none GOAL:riickgewinnen 
i 
OBJECT: W~-me 
there only has to be lexical transfer => 
oblige 
SUBJECT: none / ~ ~ ~ ' ~ ~  recover 
! 
OBJECT: heat 
to present a structure to generation that 
cames enough information to produce the 
English translation given above ('Obliged to 
recover heat'). 
Similarly, examples 1. and 3. can be 
represented by the parser in a way which 
allows the generation of the correct target 
language quivalent, e.g.: 
'Zur Optimierung von Waldschadenserhe- 
bungen' 
TOPIC: ~)ptimierung 
OBJECT: Waldschadenserhebung 
- 307 - 
transfer => 
TOPIC: optimization 
I 
OBJECT: wood damage survey 
generation => 
'The optimization of wood damage surveys' 
The surface realization of the semantic roles 
TOPIC and OBJECT is a task for zenerati- 
v 
on, i.e. transfer can be completely relieved 
of rules treating such semantic roles (cf. 
Luckhardt 1987). 
CONCLUSION 
Sublanguage is a notion MT developers 
ought to turn their attention to 
when their system has reached a 
stable and robust state offering the 
necessary tools and methods of 
language ngineering like weighting 
mechanisms 
when their system is about to be 
applied to large volumes of text with 
distinct sublanguage characteristics 
if a terminological data base system 
has been established which makes it 
possible to cover the lexical and 
inhouse usage levels of 
sublanguages and which can be 
accessed by the MT system 
if the necessary machine-readable 
terminology is at hand. 
A sublanguage is not as easy to implement 
as it may appear from a first glance at texts 
of a specific corpus, however distinct that 
type of text may look. Very often the 
apparently formalizable criteria turn out to 
be useless for MT, although any human 
reader could easily formulate them. The 
METEO ideal of a sublanguage surely 
cannot be reproduced easily.
