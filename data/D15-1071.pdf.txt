Abstract
In November 2014, the European Cen-
tral Bank (ECB) started to directly su-
pervise the largest banks in the Euro-
zone via the Single Supervisory Mecha-
nism (SSM). While supervisory risk as-
sessments are usually based on quantita-
tive data and surveys, this work explores
whether sentiment analysis is capable of
measuring a bank’s attitude and opinions
towards risk by analyzing text data. For
realizing this study, a collection consisting
of more than 500 CEO letters and outlook
sections extracted from bank annual re-
ports is built up. Based on these data, two
distinct experiments are conducted. The
evaluations find promising opportunities,
but also limitations for risk sentiment anal-
ysis in banking supervision. At the level of
individual banks, predictions are relatively
inaccurate. In contrast, the analysis of ag-
gregated figures revealed strong and sig-
nificant correlations between uncertainty
or negativity in textual disclosures and the
quantitative risk indicator’s future evolu-
tion. Risk sentiment analysis should there-
fore rather be used for macroprudential
analyses than for assessments of individ-
ual banks.
1 Introduction
From 2007 on, a global crisis struck the financial
markets and led to a severe slow-down of the real
economy. It was triggered by the collapsing US
subprime mortgage sector, where loans had been
issued to borrowers with poor credit ratings. Due
to the tight interconnectedness of the financial sys-
tem, problems quickly propagated in the global
banking system. Governments had to bail out im-
portant institutions like Northern Rock, but such
solutions could not be provided for every troubled
bank. In September 2008, the large investment
bank Lehman Brothers had to file bankruptcy. In
the aftermath of this event, further banks had to be
rescued in order to stabilize the financial system.
This deep financial crisis highlighted the necessity
of better financial regulation as well as more ef-
fective financial supervision in the future (Hodson
and Quaglia, 2009).
As a reaction to the crisis and its severe eco-
nomic consequences, EU institutions decided to
build up an European Banking Union (EBU). The
EBU consists of three pillars, one of them being
a new system of financial supervision, the Sin-
gle Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Its goal is to
“promote long-term safety and soundness of credit
institutions and the stability of the financial sys-
tem within the Union and each Member State
[...]” (Council of the EU, 2013, p. 72).
For supervising over 120 of the largest banks
in the Eurozone, the SSM utilizes a range of in-
formation sources in order to detect vulnerabilities
and risks. The sources include mainly backward-
looking quantitative Key Risk Indicators (KRIs),
which are complemented with surveys in order to
include forward-looking information as well (Eu-
ropean Banking Authority, 2014). However, an-
other source of information seems to be largely
untapped, namely textual data published by the
banks. Publications like periodic reports, press re-
leases, and news published for investors also con-
tain forward-looking information. Analyzing this
readily available data would be more cost-efficient
in comparison to traditional approaches like sur-
veys. It could provide answers to questions like:
what does official communication by banks re-
veal about their expectations and attitudes towards
risk?
In this paper, we present a novel applica-
tion of sentiment analysis for exploring attitudes
and opinions about risk in textual disclosures by
591
banks. In particular, this work (1) finds suitable
data sources, (2) identifies appropriate techniques
for risk sentiment analysis, and (3) analyzes risk
sentiment within the last decade in order to cover
the financial crisis of 2007-08 adequately. The de-
rived sentiment scores quantify uncertainty, nega-
tivity, and positivity in the analyzed documents.
All of them are interesting with regards to risk
sentiment analysis: uncertainty relates to risk in
a direct way since the latter are “uncertainties re-
sulting in adverse variations of profitability or in
losses” (Bessis, 2002, p. 11). Highly negative sen-
timent refers to current or future problems, and
too positive sentiment could represent overconfi-
dence. We find that sentiment scores reflect not
only the financial crisis, but also other major eco-
nomic events within the last decade.
In addition, we test for correlations between the
sentiment scores and a popular quantitative risk in-
dicator. It turns out that aggregated risk sentiment
in forward-looking documents is a leading indica-
tor for the actual risk figures, so it can be used
within predictive models.
The remainder of this paper, which is based on
the Master’s thesis of one of the authors (Nopp,
2015), is organized as follows: first, we give an
overview on related work in the field of risk sen-
timent analysis. The following section introduces
the chosen sources for text data and quantitative
figures. Afterwards, we give an overview on the
chosen methodologies and evaluate the experi-
mental results. The last section concludes.
2 Related Work
Sentiment analysis in general and its application
in the financial domain in particular gained a lot
of interest within the last decade. There is a num-
ber of studies which aim to identify risks by means
of text mining. A common question tackled by
researchers is whether corporate disclosures drive
stock price volatilities or future earnings of the re-
spective firm (Groth and Muntermann, 2011; Ko-
gan et al., 2009; Tsai and Wang, 2013). Hence,
they focus on the risk an investor takes if he or
she buys stocks of a company. Generally spo-
ken, these studies find significant correlations be-
tween sentiment extracted from corporate disclo-
sures and future volatilities. Other papers deal
with financial distress prediction, for example Ha-
jek and Olej (2013). As a baseline, they classify
companies based on financial indicators. It turned
out that the inclusion of sentiment indicators im-
proved financial distress prediction.
Among the text data sources for these studies
are mainly annual reports, but also news stories
or earning calls transcripts
1
. Kogan et al. (2009)
exclude irrelevant information from the annual re-
ports by focusing on a section which contains im-
portant forward-looking content.
In the related studies, authors work with simi-
lar approaches for extracting sentiment from texts.
Linguistic preprocessing generally involves to-
kenization, lemmatization, and removing non-
essential items like tables, exhibits, or digit se-
quences. In almost every study, the authors also
make use of term weighting schemes. With the
selected features and additional quantitative data,
the studies either employ machine learning algo-
rithms, or use the data for regression analyses.
Although none of the mentioned papers focuses
on risk sentiment analysis in the banking industry,
parts of their processing pipelines and approaches
can be reused for this work. With regards to the se-
lection of appropriate data sources, it can be con-
cluded that analyzing annual reports is very pop-
ular in this field of research. Hence, these data
should also be considered for the experiments of
this study. In contrast to the majority of the related
papers, we only use specific sections of the annual
reports, namely CEO letters and outlook sections
(see Section 3).
Regarding the machine learning algorithms and
the incorporation of quantitative indicators, the ap-
proaches of Groth and Muntermann (2011), Ko-
gan et al. (2009), and Hajek and Olej (2013) are a
good basis for the experiments of this study. All of
them define the document labels based on suitable
quantitative indicators. For labeling, the related
studies consider the fact that text data are forward-
looking, but quantitative indicators reflect the past.
Hence, the indicators are taken from one period
after publication of the text data. The labeled data
are then used for training machine learning algo-
rithms. Since the focus of our work lies on banks,
we make use of a specific quantitative risk indica-
tor which is not employed by related studies. In
the following section, we introduce this indicator
and the selected text data sources.

3 Data Sources
Among this work’s aims is to test for relations be-
tween textual risk sentiment and quantitative risk
indicators. A careful selection of sources for both
types of data is crucial since irrelevant ones would
lead to biased conclusions.
Quantitative Risk Indicator. The selected
quantitative risk indicator has to represent fi-
nancial health and the general risk exposure of
a bank within a specific period or at a specific
point in time. Furthermore, the data have to be
(1) publicly accessible, (2) available for each
analyzed bank, (3) published at least annually,
and (4) comparable among the different banks.
A comparison of several quantitative risk in-
dicators based on expert interviews revealed that
only the Tier 1 Capital Ratio (T1) fulfills all cri-
teria. The T1 is one of the most important ratios
based on risk-weighted amount of the bank’s as-
sets. In particular, it refers to the bank’s Tier 1
capital as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets:
Tier 1 Capital Ratio =
Tier 1 Capital
Risk-Weighted Assets
(1)
Tier 1 capital is considered as the best form of
bank capital and has to fulfill several criteria mak-
ing it relatively secure. As Cannata et al. (2012,
p. 12) put it, this ratio “measures the ability of the
bank to absorb losses”. If the T1 is high, the bank
acts conservatively and with a high risk buffer. A
high ratio can be achieved by either increasing the
Tier 1 capital or by reducing the amount of risk-
weighted assets, i.e. reducing the amount of total
assets or replacing them with safer ones.
The T1 also played a major role during the 2014
EU-wide banking stress test, which was an impor-
tant part of the preparation phase for the Single
Supervisory Mechanism. The stress test had the
purpose to assess the resilience of large EU banks
in different macroeconomic scenarios, measured
by the impact on the T1.
Text Data Sources. In order to minimize noise
and to enhance the sentiment analysis validity, it is
crucial to work with the documents well adapted to
the task of risk sentiment analysis. Like the quan-
titative risk indicators, they need to be (1) publicly
accessible, (2) available for every analyzed bank,
and (3) published at least annually. In addition, for
this study, the documents need to be (4) written in
the English language, (5) directly published by the
bank, and (6) contain forward-looking and subjec-
tive information about the bank’s attitude and ex-
pectations towards risk.
These criteria are best fulfilled by two types of
document published in the banks’ annual reports,
namely CEO letters and outlook sections. The for-
mer are carefully crafted documents which con-
tain valuable information about the management’s
opinions about risk. Amernic et al. (2010) recog-
nize in their study from 2010 that the word choice
of managers strongly influences companies, and
CEO letters are a way for communicating their at-
titudes and values.
Outlook sections are usually a part of the man-
agement report, which is a textual summary of the
bank’s results, its business environment, and regu-
latory as well as internal developments. In their
outlook on the next year, banks write about the
expected macroeconomic environment, manage-
ment guidelines, and priorities for the next period.
These documents might be less subjective com-
pared to CEO letters, but they are usually more
comprehensive and contain interesting forward-
looking information.
Collection of Data. The annual reports for this
work were collected via a Bloomberg Terminal,
supplemented by direct downloads from bank
websites. In total, over 500 documents from 27
banks which published them between 2001 and
2013 were collected. The sample contains banks
from all 12 countries which have belonged to the
Eurozone at least since 2002. This promotes com-
parability of the data because the banks operated
in similar economic circumstances and with the
same currency.
Further data were retrieved from the online
database Bankscope: the bank’s country of resi-
dence, its full name, its size measured by total as-
sets, and its Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of each
year between 2001 and 2013. 31 % of the Tier 1
capital ratios could not be directly retrieved from
the database, so they had to be manually extracted
from the respective annual reports.
4 Methodologies
Two independent approaches are employed for the
risk sentiment analysis. First, a lexicon-based ap-
proach derives and analyzes negativity, positivity,
and uncertainty in publications by banks. The
second approach aims to predict the evolution of
593
quantitative risk indicators by means of supervised
classification. The aim of both approaches is to
assess the potential of risk sentiment analysis in
banking supervision.
Creation of the Document Collection. The
original documents are provided as PDF files. For
building up the collection, they have to be parsed
in order to acquire plain text files containing the
required sections. One method for extracting the
relevant sections is to split the original PDF files
according to their bookmarks and to convert them
into plain text files afterwards. Another way is to
convert the PDF files already in the first step and
to extract the relevant sections by making use of
specific tokens. For example, a typical CEO let-
ter is delimited by the tokens Dear Shareholders
and Sincerely. If neither of these semi-automated
approaches is applicable, the extraction has to be
done manually

Table 4 gives an overview of the number of doc-
uments in the created collection. It shows that the
number of published outlook sections constantly
increased between 2002 and 2008. From 2009
on, the number was quite stable. The number of
CEO letters also increased over time, but only un-
til 2008, when some CEOs stopped writing letters
in the course of the financial crisis.

4.1 Lexicon-based Approach
The first experiment is about analyzing sentiment
scores derived from the documents by incorpo-

This was the case for around 20 % of the documents.
rating finance-specific word lists. The objective
of this experiment is to show how the language
of forward-looking disclosures by European banks
evolved within the last decade. The workflow con-
sists of the following steps: (1) pre-processing the
collected data, (2) the actual sentiment analysis
which derives the scores, (3) data consolidation,
and (4) data evaluation.
Sentiment Tagging. In the first step of the anal-
ysis, sentiment words in the textual data are
tagged. In particular, this study works with neg-
ative words (Fin-Neg), positive words (Fin-Pos),
and words related to uncertainty (Fin-Unc). All
of these word lists are provided by Loughran and
McDonald (2011). Such topic-specific word lists
are necessary because many words bear a different
sentiment if used in a financial context: according
to Loughran and McDonald (2011), almost three
quarters (73.8 %) of typically negative words can-
not be considered as negative when they appear in
financial texts. Kearney and Liu (2014) give the
examples tax and liability. These words appear in
the Harvard IV Negative Word List (H4N), but are
neutral when used in a financial context, e.g. in
an annual report. Table 2 lists some examples for
sentiment words in the financial context.
Positive efficient, stabilized, vibrant
Negative closure, postpone, threat
Uncertainty approximately, might, volatility
Table 2: Examples for opinion words in the finan-
cial context (Loughran and McDonald, 2011).
Term Weighting. All terms in a document are
normalized by
N
j
=
1
?
?
m
i=0
(G
i
L
i,j
)
2
. (2)
This equation is based on Salton and Buck-
ley (1988) and accounts for documents of differ-
ent lengths. G
i
is the global weight of term i and
L
i,j
the local weight of term i in document j. An
established method for the latter is given by the
following formula (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999,
p. 543):
L
i,j
=
{
1 + log(tf
i ,j
) if tf
i ,j
? 1
0 otherwise
(3)
594
The term frequency is denoted as tf
i,j
. The most
popular global weight is the inverse document fre-
quency (IDF). In
G
i
= log
(
N
df
i
)
, (4)
the total number of documents is denoted by N ,
and df
i
is the number of documents where term i
occurs at least once (Salton and Buckley, 1988).
Valence Shifting. In order to account for
negated sentiment words, the simple negation han-
dling algorithm proposed by Polanyi and Zae-
nen (2006) is implemented. If one of the three di-
rect predecessors of a sentiment word is a negation
word
3
, its sentiment score will be negated. This is
done by assigning ?1 to the valence shifter vari-
able v
i
of term i. If there is no negation word
among the predecessors, v
i
is set to 1.
Calculating Sentiment Scores. The document-
level sentiment scores are calculated for three sen-
timent classes, namely uncertainty, positivity, and
negativity. In
s
c,j
=
?
i?c
L
i,j
G
i
N
j
v
i
, (5)
the term-level sentiment score is represented by
the product of the term weights L
i,j
and G
i
, the
normalization factor N
j
, and the valence shifter
v
i
. The document sentiment score s
c,j
is the sum
of the term sentiment scores which belong to the
document j and the sentiment class c.
Data Consolidation and Evaluation. After cal-
culating the sentiment scores, the data are filtered
and grouped in order to prepare them for the evalu-
ations. In particular, the data are filtered according
to specific countries and grouped by year respec-
tively by bank.
4.2 Supervised Classification
For the second experiment, the documents are la-
beled based on a quantitative risk measure, namely
the T1 dating to the end of the period referred to
in the CEO letters and outlook sections. These
data are then used for training supervised classi-
fication algorithms which aim to predict the indi-
cator’s evolution.
3
The considered negation words are no, not, don’t, never,
none, and neither.
The experiment consists of three steps: (1) read-
ing and parsing the collected data as well as as-
signing the class labels, (2) linguistic preprocess-
ing and feature selection, and (3) classifying the
data with Na¨?ve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector
Machine (SVM).
Assigning the Class Labels. The Tier 1 capital
ratio is published by banks at least once a year.
Since it is actually a continuous measure, it al-
ways strongly depends on the previous year’s ra-
tio. Banking supervisors like the ECB are inter-
ested in the future evolution of the ratio: if it in-
creases, the bank acts in a less risky way, and vice
versa. Hence, appropriate labels for the supervised
classification task are UP for an increasing T1, and
DOWN for a decreasing one. We assume that the
T1 did not change notably if the difference to the
previous year is less than 0.2 percent points
4
. In
this case, no class label is assigned.
Preprocessing and Feature Selection. Linguis-
tic preprocessing comprises the removal of punc-
tuation, numbers, single characters, and stop
words. The remaining words are converted to
lower case. Furthermore, the terms are weighted
according to the term weighting strategy presented
in Section 4.1.
For feature selection, two approaches are fol-
lowed. The first one assumes that the sentiment
words used in the lexicon-based analysis are the
relevant features for this experiment. Hence, all
words which do not appear in the first experi-
ment’s dictionaries are removed. The second ap-
proach utilizes a Snowball Stemmer to ensure that
different versions of the same word are treated as
equal. Its feature selection strategy is based on
the concepts of document frequency (DF) and in-
formation gain (IG). For DF, tests showed that a
lower bound of 20 documents yields the best re-
sults. The objective of the IG measure is to iden-
tify those features which have the highest discrim-
inatory power in a classification problem. It mea-
sures the impurity of a dataset, i.e. its entropy. If
a feature is able to reduce the entropy in a data
set by a large amount, its information gain is high.
Such features have a relatively high ability to pre-
dict the corresponding class. For calculating the
information gain, one has to compute the entropies
given the presence or absence of a feature in a
data set and subtract the results from the entropy

This affected 17 % of the data points in the sample.
595
of the original data set (Aggarwal and Zhai, 2012,
p. 169).
Classification. The outcome of the previous
steps is a set of document vectors with associated
class labels. With these data, the classification al-
gorithms Na¨?ve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector
Machine (SVM) are trained. The latter is used
in its basic version, i.e. with a linear kernel. The
performance measures are determined by employ-
ing 10-fold cross validation, which helps to avoid
problems like overfitting.
While Na¨?ve Bayes works without parameters,
the linear SVM depends on the parameter C. Its
optimal value of 111 was determined by conduct-
ing an automated grid search.
5 Evaluation of the Experiments
Both experiments aim to capture attitudes and
opinions about risk by analyzing CEO letters and
outlook sections of Eurozone banks. In this sec-
tion, conclusions are drawn from the results of the
experiments.
5.1 Evaluation of the Lexicon-based
Approach
The outcome of the lexicon-based approach con-
sists of sentiment scores for each document repre-
senting the degrees of uncertainty, negativity, and
positivity.
Evolution of Sentiment Over Time. Figure 1
shows how sentiment in CEO letters has been
evolving since 2002. The evolution of sentiment in
outlook sections is not depicted, but is very similar
to that of CEO letters. The individual data points
represent the arithmetic mean of the document-
level sentiment scores for each year. In 2002 and
2003, CEO letters contained more negative sen-
timent than in the following years. Banks might
have emphasized that the recession following the
burst of the dot-com bubble was still not over
and that recovery had not yet arrived. Between
2003 and 2006, the letters became more positive
and less negative from year to year. The turn-
ing point was in 2006—from that time on, nega-
tivity in CEO letters rose and quadrupled within
three years. During the same period, positive sen-
timent scores decreased continuously. The summit
of these evolutions was in 2009, in the midst of
the financial crisis. The letters in 2010 had been
already much more optimistic, but negativity in-
creased in 2011 and 2012 again when CEOs rec-
ognized that the crisis was still not over.
The evolution of the uncertainty scores is simi-
lar to the negative sentiment scores. This observa-
tion is supported by a high correlation coefficient
of 0.93 between uncertainty and negativity scores.
Since 2012, uncertainty has been decreasing quite
sharply. This can potentially be attributed to an
important and often-cited speech by ECB presi-
dent Mario Draghi, who calmed the financial mar-
kets with the announcement to do “whatever it
takes to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will
be enough”
5
.
Another observation is that the average uncer-
tainty scores are much lower than the average pos-
itivity and negativity scores. A plausible interpre-
tation thereof is that CEOs rather use clear state-
ments than uncertain language.
Do Sentiment Scores Predict Quantitative Risk
Measures? A comparison of the T1 average
evolution and the corresponding sentiment scores
reveals interesting relations, see Figure 2. The
correlation coefficients in Table 3 indicate that a
higher degree of uncertainty or negativity in the
documents is commonly followed by a higher in-
crease of the T1, and vice versa.
It is interesting to analyze the data by a regres-
sion model for predicting the T1 evolution. Table
4 shows such a model with negativity as the only
explaining variable. The coefficients can be inter-
preted as follows: if the average negativity score
rises by one unit, the T1 evolution increases by
0.9963 pp. If negativity is zero, the Tier 1 capital
ratio would decrease by the computed intercept,
which is -0.502 pp. Both coefficients are statisti-
cally significant if a 95 % confidence level is as-
sumed.
About 76 % of the average T1 evolution’s vari-
ation can be explained by the negativity score. A
model of similar quality could be constructed by
analyzing uncertainty in outlook sections. Hence,
sentiment scores can be considered as an addi-
tional leading indicator for the future evolution of
the Tier 1 capital ratio.
Limitations. A drawback of this regression
model is that it cannot model external shocks
which influence the T1 evolution, but are not ad-

equately covered in the text data. Examples for
such shocks would be new regulations concern-
ing the minimum capital ratio or monetary pol-
icy actions by the ECB. A further limitation is in-
duced by the fact that our methodology makes use
of the bag of words (BoW) model, which ignores
the documents internal structure. Hence, it is not
possible to utilize information like word order and
grammar, although this definitely plays a role in
carefully crafted documents like CEO letters.
It should also be emphasized that the model is
based on figures aggregated by year. Applying it
on the data of individual banks could lead to in-
correct conclusions. This assumption is supported
by Figure 3, which compares negativity scores of
individual outlook sections with the associated T1
evolutions. Although it is still possible to identify

variance is too big for satisfactory representation

. This observation is in line
with the relatively high standard deviations if the
figures are aggregated by year, see Figure 2.
5.2 Evaluation of the Supervised
Classification Approach
The supervised classification experiment aims to
assess whether this approach works better than the
lexicon-based approach in terms of predicting the
T1 evolution for individual banks based on their
CEO letters or outlook sections. The class la-
bels UP and DOWN have been assigned accord-
ing to the direction of the T1 evolution. Table
5 gives an overview of the experiments and lists

If the regression model is built with non-aggregated data,
it explains only 6.6 % of the variation.
the respective performance measures. An analy-
sis of the data in the table reveals interesting re-
sults. First, feature selection based on document
frequency and information gain works better than
the approach based on word lists. Second, the clas-
sifiers trained with CEO letters yield better results
than the ones trained with outlook sections. Fi-
nally, three out of the four SVM results are not
meaningful due to the following reason: the pa-
rameter optimization of C suggests to choose a
very low value, which indeed maximizes the clas-
sifier accuracy—but these SVMs simply assign the
class UP to every instance. These classifiers can
be seen as a baseline for comparisons. However,
the remaining SVM clearly yields the best results
among the employed algorithms.
None of the classifiers based on the feature se-
lection method (1) is able to outperform the base-
line (assigning every instance to the UP class).
Both SVMs simply classify every instance as UP,
and the Na¨?ve Bayes classifiers also deliver unsat-
isfactory results. Feature selection based on docu-
ment frequency and information gain achieves bet-
ter results than the first one, but only when the
classifiers are trained with the CEO letter collec-
tion. Most likely, this can be explained with the
fact that outlook sections provide less terms with
discriminatory power than CEO letters. Na¨?ve
Bayes correctly classifies 75 % of the instances,
and the optimized SVM yields 79.2 %. The other
SVM performance measures can be interpreted as
follows: 81 % of the instances classified as UP
were indeed instances where the Tier 1 capital
ratio increased (= precision U). Furthermore, the
SVM correctly identified almost 92 % of the in-
stances which belong to the class UP (= recall U).
These results are better than the baseline and
demonstrate a noticeable potential for supervised
classification even at the level of individual bank
disclosures. Nevertheless, they are not good
enough for reliable predictions. However, the
aggregated classification data accurately predict
whether the majority of banks will increase or de-
crease their Tier 1 capital ratio in the following
year: for 12 out of 13 years, the algorithm cor-
rectly predicts the direction of the T1 evolution.
This finding is in line with the lexicon-based ap-
proach, where the aggregated data yielded much
better results than the individual ones.

6 Conclusion
This study explored how banking supervisors
could utilize sentiment analysis for risk assess-
ments. The analysis of potential document types
revealed that two sections in a bank’s annual re-
port are particularly well suited for this work,
namely CEO letters and outlook sections. The for-
mer represent the tone from the top and provide
subjective information about the bank’s current
and future situation. Outlook sections are exclu-
sively forward-looking and reveal opinions about
the near future. Furthermore, the Tier 1 capital
ratio (T1) is the best suited quantitative risk indi-
cator. The T1 sets the most secure forms of bank
capital in relation to its risk-weighted assets and is
widely used in banking supervision, e.g. as a key
ratio for the ECB’s stress test in fall 2014.
The lexicon-based analysis showed that senti-
ment scores reflect major economic events be-
tween 2002 and 2014 very well. In addition, there
is a strong correlation between uncertainty, neg-
ativity, and the Tier 1 capital ratio evolution over
time. Hence, the sentiment scores could be used in
regression models for predicting the T1 evolution.
However, the results are only meaningful if the fig-
ures are aggregated by year. Applying the model
on data of individual banks leads to inaccurate re-
sults. It should also be noted that this method is
not meant to be used as a stand-alone estimator for
the T1 evolution. Instead, it should be combined
with other estimation methods.
The supervised risk classification approach cor-
rectly classifies 79.2 % of the CEO letters. This
is not good if one considers that it is possible to
yield an accuracy of 70 % simply by assigning the
class UP to every instance. However, if the results
of the best SVM classifier are aggregated by year,
the data correctly predict for 12 out of 13 years
whether the majority of banks will increase or de-
crease their Tier 1 capital ratio.
The described systems have the potential to pro-
vide valuable insights for banking supervisors, in
particular because of the strong correlation be-
tween sentiment scores derived from textual data
and the T1. Because of the mentioned limitations,
these techniques should only be used for macro-
prudential analyses, i.e. the promotion of stability
in the whole financial system. Examples are pre-
dictions for the average Tier 1 capital ratio’s evolu-
tion in the whole Eurozone or in groups of coun-
tries. Another option is to improve existing risk
prediction frameworks.
For future research, it would be interesting
to validate the results by conducting the study
on a larger scale. One could incorporate data
from all European banks, or from other regions.
The approach could also be used for other docu-
ment types, for example analyst reports or inter-
nal memos, or in other industries. Regarding the
methodology, it would be interesting to see how
alternative algorithms or word lists would affect
the results.
