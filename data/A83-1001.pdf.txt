an expert natural language interface to online 
data  bases. 
I. BRIEF SUMMARIES 
\[CIN\]:A robust ~ data base interface has 
been described. The system consists of two 
parts:a natural Language processor for 
building a formal representation and an 
application program for building a query in an 
augmented relational algebra. Portability is 
achieved by providing (i) definitions of new 
concepts for the NL processor and ( i l )  the 
connection between the relations in the data 
base and ~ processor concepts.  
\[GHF\]:A robust  por tab le  NL in ter face  is 
daecr ibad ,  the  por tab i l i ty  eva luced  with 
respect  to two app l i ca t ion  domains .  The 
In l t ta l  p rocess ing  i s  based on the  L ingu is t i c  
S t r ing  Parser .  The domain dependent  
in fo rmat ion  is character i zed  by domain 
in fo rmat ion  scheaa  which spec i fy  the  
cor respondences  between in fo rmat ion  s t ruc tures  
in  the  texts  and the  var ious  in terna l  
representat ions .  Hodu lar i ty  of  des ign  i s  
emphas ized  fo r  ach iev ing  por tab i l i ty  and 
managing complex i ty .  
\[GRO\]:The major  them i s  the  const ruc t ion  
of  t ranspor tab le  NL in ter faces .  A un ique  
feature  of  the  TEA}{ sys tem i s  the  in teract ive  
fac l l ty  fo r  acqu i r ing  in fo rmat ion  fo r  adapt ing  
gL in ter faces  to  data  bases fo r  which they  
were not  handta i lo red .  The DIALOGIC sys tem 
const ruc ts  a log ica l  form fo r  the  query  and 
the  data  base access  sys tem t rans la tes  the  
logical form Into a data base query. 
Transportability is achieved by factoring the 
domain dependant and domain independent 
information. Soma acquisitional and control

\[TB\]: This is a retrospective view of 
the SUFID system, traclng i t s  develpoment from 
the initlal design spec i f i ca t ions ,  tncludln g 
various stages of intermediate implementations 
and exparlence with different applications, 
and finally,endlng with a list of problems to 
be solved. TB conclude that robust ~ systems 
do not exist and provide some guidelines for 
the des ign  of such systems. 
\ [TT\] :The NL in ter face(ASK)  i s  meant for  a 
user  who wants to c reate ,  tes t  change,  
augment, and, of course, use her /h i s  knowledge 
base. The user interface is a limited subset 
of English. Fast response time is a major 
goal. Transportability is achieved via a 
dialogue in ASK which drives the Bulk Data 
Input Capability. Dialogues In ASK can also 
he used to design dialogues. A unique feature 
of the  sys tem i s  that  I t  has  been a l ready  
implemented on a deskt r  computer ,RP 9846. 
\[GT\]:An ~ interface, IR-NLI, i s  
descr ibed ,  which i s  meant fo r  non- 
p ro fess iona l  users  fo r  access ing  on-L ine  data  
bases .  The bas ic  components of the system are  
descr ibed  in genera l  terms.  An i l lus t ra t ive  
exampte is  p resented  in which , in add i t ion  to 
the user-system dialogue, the Internal 
representaclons and the search sCrategles are 
reported in the Euronet DIANE EUROLANGUAGE. 
Severa l  fu ture  d i rec t ions  are  
suggesced,includlng the system taking more 
InlCiaCive and providing Justification of Its 
mode of operaclon. 
If. SOME QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
\[. Al l  authors  have dea l t  w i th  the i ssue  
of domain independence, an impor tant  aspect  of 
por tab i l i ty  and robustness .  The main s t ra tegy  
fo r  ach iev ing  th i s  behavtour  i s  to fac tor  the 
system in to  two par ts ,  one based on domain 
independent  knowledge and the ocher  on the 
domain dependent knowledge. At leas t  two 
systems\[GRO and I'T\] talk about Interactively 
acquiring the \[nformaCion needed for 
adaptation. GRO and TT should discuss the 
s imi la r i t ies  and d i f fe rences  in  the i r  
approaches  to acqu is i t ion .  
2. GIN uses  the pre ference  in fo rmat ion  
in the data  base connect ion  par t  of h i s  system 
to induce coerc ions(e .g . ,  "a doctor  w i th in  200 
miles" meaning "a ship wlth a doctor on it 
within 200 miles). GRO in TEAM achieves the 
~ame effect by inference rules. ~t is noc 
clear Just what the difference is between 
GRO's approach and GEN"s approach, i.e., 
between inducing coercions and making the 
inferences. GRO nad GiN should discuss the 
realtive merits of their approaches. 
3. The domain information schema of GHF 
specify the correspondence between information 
structures as chef appear in the text and the 
various internal representaclons of 
i n fo rmat ion  in the system. The system 
described by GHF is the only one in this 
session which derives ice domain dependent 
knowledge from the texts Instead of domain 
expects. GHJ should discuss how successful 
~he 7 are with thls approach. Also perhaps 
the 7 should discuss how their repreeenCatlons 
compare with those In TEAM\[GROI. 
4. T~ have reviewed the hlecory of EUFZD 
and ended up on a negative note. They feel 
robust systems do not really exlsC yet. Since 
a\[l the other authors have described "robust" 
systems, perhaps TB should discuss their 
conclusions in some de,all and comment on ChL 
claims of these authors. 
5. TT have empahsized the speed of 
response  as a major  feature  of the i r  sys tem.  
What are  the t rade-o i l s  between speed and the 
modu lar i ty  of the des ign  ? TT shou ld  comment 
on th i s  aspect  as wa l l  as ocher  re la ted  
aspects  due co the i r  concern  fo r  b r ing ing  up 
the system on a desktop  computer .  
6. Most of the i ssues  d i scussed  by GT in  
the f i r s t  four  sect ions  of the i r  paper  per ta in  
co making formal  query language(FL) iucer faces  
a l so  por tab le .  ~n fac t ,  many of the i ssues  
about  por tab i l i ty  chat  the o ther  authors  have 
addressed  co are  a l so  re la ted  co FL 
interfaces. It would be very useful if 
soma(or all) of the authors discuss some 
spec i f i c  problems about  por tab i l i ty  chat  are  
special to NL interfaces in contrast to PL 
interfaces. 
Does the need for having flexible and 
9ortable interfaces for data bases necessarily 
force us towards NL interfaces ? Ne hope so ! 
Perhaps, some of the authors will comment on 
Chls issue. Their specific experience with 
chelr own systems would be very relevant here. 
7. A quesClon chaC is worth discussing by 
all the authors is whether portability and 
robustness can be helped if the design of the 
data base itself is decemined by the 
consideration chat an NL Interface will be 
hooked to IC ?
