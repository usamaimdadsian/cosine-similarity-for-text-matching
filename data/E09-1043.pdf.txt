Abstract
We extend the factored translation model
(Koehn and Hoang, 2007) to allow trans-
lations of longer phrases composed of fac-
tors such as POS and morphological tags
to act as templates for the selection and re-
ordering of surface phrase translation. We
also reintroduce the use of alignment in-
formation within the decoder, which forms
an integral part of decoding in the Align-
ment Template System (Och, 2002), into
phrase-based decoding.
Results show an increase in transla-
tion performance of up to 1.0% BLEU
for out-of-domain French–English transla-
tion. We also show how this method com-
pares and relates to lexicalized reordering.
1 Introduction
One of the major issues in statistical machine
translation is reordering due to systematic word-
ordering differences between languages. Often re-
ordering is best explained by linguistic categories,
such as part-of-speech tags. In fact, prior work
has examined the use of part-of-speech tags in
pre-reordering schemes, Tomas and Casacuberta
(2003).
Re-ordering can also be viewed as composing
of a number of related problems which can be ex-
plained or solved by a variety of linguistic phe-
nomena. Firstly, differences between phrase or-
dering account for much of the long-range re-
ordering. Syntax-based and hierarchical models
such as (Chiang, 2005) attempts to address this
problem. Shorter range re-ordering, such as intra-
phrasal word re-ordering, can often be predicted
from the underlying property of the words and
its context, the most obvious property being POS
tags.
In this paper, we tackle the issue of shorter-
range re-ordering in phrase-based decoding by
presenting an extension of the factored transla-
tion which directly models the translation of non-
surface factors such as POS tags. We shall call this
extension the factored template model. We use the
fact that factors such as POS-tags are less sparse
than surface words to obtain longer phrase trans-
lations. These translations are used to inform the
re-ordering of surface phrases.
Despite the ability of phrase-based systems to
use multi-word phrases, the majority of phrases
used during decoding are one word phrases, which
we will show in later sections. Using word trans-
lations negates the implicit capability of phrases
to re-order words. We show that the proposed
extension increases the number of multi-word
phrases used during decoding, capturing the im-
plicit ordering with the phrase translation, lead-
ing to overall better sentence translation. In
our tests, we obtained 1.0% increase in absolute
for French-English translation, and 0.8% increase
for German-English translation, trained on News
Commentary corpora 1.
We will begin by recounting the phrase-based
and factored model in Section 2 and describe the
language model and lexicalized re-ordering model
and the advantages and disadvantages of using
these models to influence re-ordering. The pro-
posed model is described in Section 4.
2 Background
Let us first provide some background on phrase-
based and factored translation, as well as the use
of part-of-speech tags in reordering.
2.1 Phrase-Based Models
Phrase-based statistical machine translation has
emerged as the dominant paradigm in machine
translation research. We model the translation of
a given source language sentence s into a target
language sentence t with a probability distribution
p(t|s). The goal of translation is to find the best
translation according to the model
tBEST = argmaxt p(t|s) (1)
The argmax function defines the search objec-
tive of the decoder. We estimate p(t|s) by decom-
1http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/shared-task.html
372
posing it into component models
p(t|s) =
1
Z
?
m
h?m(t, s)
?m (2)
where h?m(t, s) is the feature function for compo-
nent m and ?m is the weight given to component
m. Z is a normalization factor which is ignored in
practice. Components are translation model scor-
ing functions, language model, reordering models
and other features.
The problem is typically presented in log-space,
which simplifies computations, but otherwise does
not change the problem due to the monotonicity of
the log function (hm = log h?m)
log p(t|s) =
?
m
?m hm(t, s) (3)
Phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003) are
limited to the mapping of small contiguous chunks
of text. In these models, the source sentence s is
segmented into a number of phrases s¯k, which are
translated one-to-one into target phrases t¯k. The
translation feature functions hTM(t, s) are com-
puted as sum of phrase translation feature func-
tions h¯TM(t¯k, s¯k):
hTM(t, s) =
?
k
h¯TM(t¯k, s¯k) (4)
where t¯k and s¯k are the phrases that make up the
target and source sentence. Note that typically
multiple feature functions for one translation table
are used (such as forward and backward probabil-
ities and lexical backoff).
2.2 Reordering in Phrase Models
Phrase-based systems implicitly perform short-
range reordering by translating multi-word
phrases where the component words may be
reordered relative to each other. However, multi-
word phrases have to have been seen and learnt
from the training corpus. This works better when
the parallel corpus is large and the training corpus
and input are from the same domain. Otherwise,
the ability to apply multi-word phrases is lessened
due to data sparsity, and therefore most used
phrases are only 1 or 2 words long.
A popular model for phrasal reordering is lexi-
calized reordering (Tillmann, 2004) which intro-
duces a probability distribution for each phrase
pair that indicates the likelihood of being trans-
lated monotone, swapped, or placed discontinu-
ous to its previous phrase. However, whether a
phrase is reordered may depend on its neighboring
phrases, which this model does not take into ac-
count. For example, the French phrase noir would
be reordered if preceded by a noun when translat-
ing into English, as in as in chat noir, but would re-
main in the same relative position when preceded
by a conjunction such as rouge et noir.
The use of language models on the decoding
output also has a significant effect on reorder-
ing by preferring hypotheses which are more flu-
ent. However, there are a number of disadvantages
with this low-order Markov model over consecu-
tive surface words. Firstly, the model has no infor-
mation about the source and may prefer orderings
of target words that are unlikely given the source.
Secondly, data sparsity may be a problem, even
if language models are trained on a large amount
of monolingual data which is easier to obtain than
parallel data. When the test set is out-of-domain
or rare words are involved, it is likely that the lan-
guage model backs off to lower order n-grams,
thus further reducing the context window.
2.3 POS-Based Reordering
This paper will look at the use of POS tags to con-
dition reordering of phrases which are closely po-
sitioned in the source and target, such as intra-
clausal reordering, however, we do not explicit
segment along clausal boundaries. By mid-range
reordering we mean a maximum distortion of
about 5 or 6 words.
The phrase-based translation model is gener-
ally believed to perform short-range reordering
adequately. It outperforms more complex mod-
els such as hierarchical translation when the most
of the reordering in a particular language pair is
reasonably short (Anonymous, 2008), as is the
case with Arabic–English. However, phrase-based
models can fail to reorder words or phrases which
would seem obvious if it had access to the POS
tags of the individual words. For example, a trans-
lation from French to English will usually cor-
rectly reorder the French phrase with POS tags
NOUN ADJECTIVE if the surface forms exists in
the phrase table or language model, e.g.,
Union Europe´enne ? European Union
However, phrase-based models may not reorder
even these small two-word phrases if the phrase
is not in the training data or involves rare words.
This situation worsens for longer phrases where
the likelihood of the phrase being previously un-
373
seen is higher. The following example has a source
POS pattern NOUN ADJECTIVE CONJUNCTION
ADJECTIVE but is incorrectly ordered as the sur-
face phrase does not occur in training,
difficulte´s e´conomiques et socials
? economic and social difficulties
However, even if the training data does not con-
tain this particular phrase, it contains many similar
phrases with the same underlying POS tags. For
example, the correct translation of the correspond-
ing POS tags of the above translation
NOUN ADJ CONJ ADJ
? ADJ CONJ ADJ NOUN
is typically observed many times in the training
corpus.
The alignment information in the training cor-
pus shows exactly how the individual words in this
phrase should be distorted, along with the POS
tag of the target words. The challenge addressed
by this paper is to integrate POS tag phrase trans-
lations and alignment information into a phrase-
based decoder in order to improve reordering.
2.4 Factor Model Decomposition
Factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang,
2007) extend the phrase-based model by inte-
grating word level factors into the decoding pro-
cess. Words are represented by vectors of fac-
tors, not simple tokens. Factors are user-definable
and do not have any specific meaning within the
model. Typically, factors are obtained from lin-
guistic tools such as taggers and parsers.
The factored decoding process can be decom-
posed into multiple steps to fully translate the in-
put. Formally, this decomposes Equation 4 further
into sub-component models (also called transla-
tion steps)
h¯TM(t¯, s¯) =
?
i
h¯iTM(t¯, s¯) (5)
with an translation feature function h¯iTM for each
translation step for each factor (or sets of factors).
There may be also generation models which create
target factors from other target factors but we ex-
clude this in our presentation for the sake of clar-
ity.
Decomposition is a convenient and flexible
method for integrating word level factors into
phrase-based decoding, allowing source and tar-
get sentences to be augmented with factors, while
at the same time controlling data sparsity. How-
ever, decomposition also implies certain indepen-
dence assumptions which may not be justified.
Various internal experiments show that decompo-
sition may decrease performance and that better
results can often be achieved by simply translat-
ing all factors jointly. While we can gain benefit
from adding factor information into phrase-based
decoding, our experience also shows the short-
comings of decomposing phrase translation.
3 Related Work
Efforts have been made to integrate syntactic in-
formation into the decoding process to improve re-
ordering.
Collins et al. (2005) reorder the source sentence
using a sequence of six manually-crafted rules,
given the syntactic parse tree of the source sen-
tence. While the transformation rules are specific
to the German parser that was used, they could
be adapted to other languages and parsers. Xia
and McCord (2004) automatically create rewrite
rules which reorder the source sentence. Zhang
and Zens (2007) take a slightly different approach
by using chunk level tags to reorder the source
sentence, creating a confusion network to repre-
sent the possible reorderings of the source sen-
tence. All these approaches seek to improve re-
ordering by making the ordering of the source sen-
tence similar to the target sentence.
Costa-jussa` and Fonollosa (2006) use a two
stage process to reorder translation in an n-gram
based decoder. The first stage uses word classes of
source words to reorder the source sentence into
a string of word classes which can be translated
monotonically to the target sentences in the sec-
ond stage.
The Alignment Template System (Och, 2002)
performs reordering by translating word classes
with their corresponding alignment information,
then translates each surface word to be consis-
tent with the alignment. Tomas and Casacuberta
(2003) extend ATS by using POS tags instead of
automatically induced word classes.
Note the limitation of the existing work of POS-
driven reordering in phrase-based models: the re-
ordering model is separated from the translation
model and the two steps are pipelined, with pass-
ing the 1-best reordering or at most a lattice to the
translation stage. The ATS models do provide an
integrated approach, but their lexical translation is
374
limited to the word level.
In contrast to prior work, we present a inte-
grated approach that allows POS-based reordering
and phrase translation. It is also open to the use of
any other factors, such as driving reordering with
automatic word classes.
Our proposed solution is similar to structural
templates described in Phillips (2007) which was
applied to an example-based MT system.
4 Translation Using Templates of Factors
A major motivation for the introduction of fac-
tors into machine translation is to generalize
phrase translation over longer segments using less
sparse factors than is possible with surface forms.
(Koehn and Hoang, 2007) describes various strate-
gies for the decomposition of the decoding into
multiple translation models using the Moses de-
coder. We shall focus on POS-tags as an example
of a less-sparsed factor.
Decomposing the translation by separately de-
coding the POS tags and surface forms is be the
obvious option, which also has a probabilistic in-
terpretation. However, this combined factors into
target words which don’t exist naturally and bring
down translation quality. Therefore, the decoding
is constrained by decomposing into two transla-
tion models; a model with POS-tag phrase pairs
only and one which jointly translates POS-tags
and surface forms. This can be expressed using
feature-functions
h¯TM(t¯, s¯) = h¯
pos
TM (t¯, s¯)h¯
surface
TM (t¯, s¯) (6)
Source segment must be decoded by both trans-
lation models but only phrase pairs where the over-
lapping factors are the same are used. As an ad-
ditional constraint, the alignment information is
retained in the translation model from the train-
ing data for every phrase pair, and both translation
models must produce consistent alignments. This
is expressed formally in Equation 7 to 9.
An alignment is a relationship which maps a
source word at position i to a target word at po-
sition j:
a : i? j (7)
Each word at each position can be aligned to
multiple words, therefore, we alter the alignment
relation to express this explicitly:
a : i? j (8)
where J is the set of positions, jJ , that I is
aligned to in the other language. Phrase pairs
for each translation model are used only if they
can satisfy condition 9 for each position of every
source word covered.
?a, b  T ?p : JpaJ
p
b 6= ? (9)
where Jpa is the alignment information for trans-
lation model, a, at word position, p and T is the set
of translation models.
4.1 Training
The training procedure is identical to the fac-
tored phrase-based training described in (Koehn
and Hoang, 2007). The phrase model retains the
word alignment information found during train-
ing. Where multiple alignment exists in the train-
ing data for a particular phrase pair, the most fre-
quent is used, in a similar manner to the calcula-
tion of the lexicalized probabilities.
Words positions which remain unaligned are ar-
tificially aligned to every word in the other lan-
guage in the phrase translation during decoding to
allow the decoder to cover the position.
4.2 Decoding
The beam search decoding algorithm is unchanged
from traditional phrase-based and factored decod-
ing. However, the creation of translation options is
extended to include the use of factored templates.
Translation options are the intermediate represen-
tation between the phrase pairs from the transla-
tion models and the hypotheses in the stack de-
coder which cover specific source spans of a sen-
tence and are applied to hypotheses to create new
hypotheses.
In phrase-based decoding, a translation option
strictly contains one phrase pair. In factored de-
coding, strictly one phrase pair from each trans-
lation model is used to create a translation op-
tions. This is possible only when the segmenta-
tion is identical for both source and target span of
each phrase pair in each translation model. How-
ever, this constraint limits the ability to use long
POS-tag phrase pairs in conjunction with shorter
surface phrase pairs.
The factored template approach extend factored
decoding by constructing translation options from
a single phrase pair from the POS-tag translation
model, but allowing multiple phrase pairs from
375
other translation models. A simplified stack de-
coder is used to compose phrases from the other
translation models. This so called intra-phrase de-
coder is constrained to creating phrases which ad-
heres to the constraint described in Section 4. The
intra-phrase decoder uses the same feature func-
tions as the main beam decoder but uses a larger
stack size due to the difficulty of creating com-
pleted phrases which satisfy the constraint. Every
source position must be covered by every transla-
tion model.
The intra-phrase decoder is used for each con-
tiguous span in the input sentence to produce
translation options which are then applied as usual
by the main decoder.
5 Experiments
We performed our experiments on the news com-
mentary corpus2 which contains 60,000 parallel
sentences for German–English and 43,000 sen-
tences for French–English. Tuning was done on
a 2000 sentence subset of the Europarl corpus
(Koehn, 2005) and tested on a 2000 sentence Eu-
roparl subset for out-of-domain, and a 1064 news
commentary sentences for in-domain.
The training corpus is aligned using Giza++
(Och and Ney, 2003). To create POS tag trans-
lation models, the surface forms on both source
and target language training data are replaced with
POS tags before phrases are extracted. The taggers
used were the Brill Tagger (Brill, 1995) for En-
glish, the Treetagger for French (Schmid, 1994),
and the LoPar Tagger (Schmidt and Schulte im
Walde, 2000) for German. The training script sup-
plied with the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007)
was used, extended to enable alignment informa-
tion of each phrase pair. The vanilla Moses MERT
tuning script was used throughout.
Results are also presented for models trained on
the larger Europarl corpora3.
5.1 German–English
We use as a baseline the traditional, non-factored
phrase model which obtained a BLEU score of
14.6% on the out-of-domain test set and 18.2% on
the in-domain test set (see Table 1, line 1).
POS tags for both source and target languages
were augmented to the training corpus and used in
the decoding and an additional trigram language

Table 2: French–English results
model was used on the target POS tags. This
increased translation performance (line 2). This
model has the same input and output factors, and
the same language models, as the factored model
we will present shortly and it therefore offers a
fairer comparison of the factored template model
than the non-factored baseline.
The factored template model (line 3) outper-
forms the baseline on both sets and the joint factor
model on the out-of-domain set.
However, we believe the language pair
German–English is not particularly suited for
the factored template approach as many of the
short-range ordering properties of German and
English are similar. For example, ADJECTIVE
NOUN phrases are ordered the same in both
languages.
5.2 French–English
Repeating the same experiments for French–
English produces bigger gains for the factored
template model. See Table 4 for details. Using
the factored template model produces the best re-
sult, with gains of 1.0 %BLEU over the unfactored
baseline on both test sets. It also outperforms the
joint factor model.
5.3 Maximum Size of Templates
Typical phrase-based model implementation use a
maximum phrase length of 7 but such long phrases
are rarely used. Long templates over POS may be
more valuable. The factored template models were
retrained with increased maximum phrase length
but this made no difference or negatively impacted
translation performance, Figure 1.
However, using larger phrase lengths over 5
words does not increase translation performance,
376
Figure 1: Varying max phrase length
as had been expected. Translation is largely un-
affected until the maximum phrase length reaches
10 when performance drops dramatically. This re-
sults suggested that the model is limited to mid-
range reordering.
6 Lexicalized Reordering Models
There has been considerable effort to improve re-
ordering in phrase-based systems. One of the most
well known is the lexicalized reordering model
(Tillmann, 2004).
The model uses the same word alignment that is
used for phrase table construction to calculate the
probability that a phrase is reordered, relative to
the previous and next source phrase.
6.1 Smoothing
Tillmann (2004) proposes a block orientation
model, where phrase translation and reordering
orientation is predicted by the same probability
distribution p(o, s¯|t¯). The variant of this imple-
mented in Moses uses a separate phrase translation
model p(s¯|t¯) and lexicalized reordering model
p(o|s¯, t¯)
The parameters for the lexicalized reordering
model are calculated using maximum likelihood
with a smoothing value ?
p(o|s¯, t¯) =
count(o, s¯, t¯) + ?
?
o?(count(o, s¯, t¯) + ?)
(10)
where the predicted orientation o is either mono-
tonic, swap or discontinuous.
The effect of smoothing lexical reordering ta-
bles on translation is negligible for both surface
forms and POS tags, except when smoothing is
disabled (?=0). Then, performance decreases
markedly, see Figure 2 for details. Note that the

ordering

Table 3: Extending the models with lexicalized re-
ordering (LR)
un-smoothed setting is closer to the block orienta-
tion model by Tillmann (2004).
6.2 Factors and Lexicalized Reordering
The model can easily be extended to take advan-
tage of the factored approach available in Moses.
In addition to the lexicalized reordering model
trained on surface forms (see line 1a in Table 3),
we also conducted various experiments with the
lexicalized reordering model for comparison.
In the joint factored model, we have both sur-
face forms and POS tags available to train the lex-
icalized reordering models on. The lexicalized re-
ordering model can be trained on the surface form,
the POS tags, jointly on both factors, or indepen-
dent models can be trained on each factor. It can
be seen from Table 3 that generalizing the reorder-
ing model on POS tags (line 2a) improves perfor-
mance, compared to the non-lexicalized reorder-
ing model (line 2). However, this performance
does not improve over the lexicalized reordering
model on surface forms (line 1a). The surface and
POS tag models complement each other to give an
overall better BLEU score (line 2b).
In the factored template model, we add a POS-
377
based lexicalized reordering model on the level of
the templates (line 3a). This gives overall the best
performance. However, the use of lexicalized re-
ordering models in the factored template model
only shows improvements in the in-domain test
set.
Lexicalized reordering model on POS tags in
factored models underperforms factored template
model as the latter includes a larger context of the
source and target POS tag sequence, while the for-
mer is limited to the extent of the surface word
phrase.
7 Analysis
A simple POS sequence that phrase-based systems
often fail to reorder is the French–English
NOUN ADJ ? ADJ NOUN
We analyzed a random sample of such phrases
from the out-of-domain corpus. The baseline
system correctly reorders 58% of translations.
Adding a lexicalized reordering model or the fac-
tored template significantly improves the reorder-
ing to above 70% (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Percentage of correctly ordered NOUN
ADJ phrases (100 samples)
A more challenging phrase to translate, such as
NOUN ADJ CONJ ADJ ? ADJ CONJ ADJ NOUN
was judge in the same way and the results show the
variance between the lexicalized reordering and
factored template model (Figure 4).
The factored template model successfully uses
POS tag templates to enable longer phrases to
be used in decoding. It can be seen from Fig-
ure 5, that the majority of input sentence is de-
coded word-by-word even in a phrase-based sys-
tem. However, the factored template configura-
Figure 4: Percentage of correctly ordered NOUN
ADJ CONJ ADJ phrases (69 samples)
Figure 5: Length of source segmentation when de-
coding out-of-domain test set
tion contains more longer phrases which enhances
mid-range reordering.
8 Larger training corpora
It is informative to compare the relative per-
formance of the factored template model when
trained with more data. We therefore used the Eu-
roparl corpora to train and tuning the models for
French to English translation. The BLEU scores
are shown below, showing no significant advan-
tage to adding POS tags or using the factored tem-
plate model. This result is similar to many others
which have shown that the large amounts of addi-
tional data negates the improvements from better
models.

9 Conclusion
We have shown the limitations of the current fac-
tored decoding model which restrict the use of
long phrase translations of less-sparsed factors.
This negates the effectiveness of decomposing
the translation process, dragging down translation
quality.
An extension to the factored model was imple-
mented which showed that using POS tag transla-
tions to create templates for surface word trans-
lations can create longer phrase translation and
lead to higher performance, dependent on lan-
guage pair.
For French–English translation, we obtained a
1.0% BLEU increase on the out-of-domain and in-
domain test sets, over the non-factored baseline.
The increase was also 0.4%/0.3% when using a
lexicalized reordering model in both cases.
In future work, we would like to apply the fac-
tored template model to reorder longer phrases.
We believe that this approach has the potential for
longer range reordering which has not yet been re-
alized in this paper. It also has some similarity to
example-based machine translation (Nagao, 1984)
which we would like to draw experience from.
We would also be interested in applying this to
other language pairs and using factor types other
than POS tags, such as syntactic chunk labels or
automatically clustered word classes.
