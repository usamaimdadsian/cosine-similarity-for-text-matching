PREFACE 
This volume contains texts of the papers presented at the Fourth Conference of 
the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, reserve papers, 
and tutorial abstracts. 
Over 130 papers were submitted for the conference, and the overall standard was 
high: it was with regret and difficulty that the Programme Committee were able to 
accept only 45, even including parallel sessions and reserve papers. We are grateful to 
all those who submitted papers, to the Programme Committee and referees for reading 
them, and to all who worked hard on local arrangements. Our thanks in particular to 
Prof. J. C. Sager and to the secretarial staff of the Centre for Computational 
Linguistics, UMIST for many forms of moral and material support. Don Walker and 
the officials of the European Chapter, Maghi King, Beat Buchmann, and Mike Rosner, 
also did much to make it all possible.

Tutorial Abstracts 
Machine Translation 
Jun-ichi Tsujii (UMIST) 
MT systems developed so far are surveyed, and the basic characteristics 
of MT which distinguish it from other NLP applications are discussed. New trends in 
research such as telephone dialogue translation, knowledge-based MT etc. are also 
discussed. 
Discourse 
Bonnie Lynn Webber (U Penn) 
Discourse places two demands on a communicative agent: (1) the need to comprehend 
and produce multiple utterances, each being interpreted in the context of those 
preceding it, and (2) the need to treat utterances as intentional behavior. Both 
processes eem to be inherently computational. That is, to model changes in context 
and attention requires consideration of the side effects of understanding and producing 
utterances. Similarly, interpreting and responding to utterances as intentional behavior 
requires support for planning and plan inference. This tutorial explores emerging 
computational models and methods for both contextual and intentional aspects of 
discourse. 
Combinatory Categorial Grammars 
Mark Steedman (U Penn) 
The session will discuss a generalisation f Categorial Grammar based on the inclusion 
of a few syntactic operations related to "combinators", such as functional composition. 
The theory implies a radical revision of accepted notions of surface structure and 
constituency, with interesting implications for theories of the production and 
comprehension f spoken and written language. 
The theory will be presented in the first instance as a theory of syntactic ompetence, 
with particular attention to constructions involving coordination and unbounded 
dependency. Attention will be paid to certain universal properties of such 
constructions across languages. The discussion will then be widened to consider the 
implications of this theory of syntax for selected problems in prosody and intonation, 
incremental semantic interpretation, and processing.

The lexicon 
Bran Boguraev (Cambridge Computer Lab & IBM Yorktown Heights) 
Knowledge of and about words underlies all natural anguage processing tasks. This 
tutorial will focus on the complementary questions of content and format(s) of 
computational lexicons, after looking in some detail at the specific lexical requirements 
of natural language processing systems. 
In particular, we will study some recent developments in theories of grammar and 
lexical semantics, and observe the implications in the way they handle lexical 
information for the organization of computational lexicons. We will trace, through a 
number of illustrative examples, issues like formalization of lexical information, 
flexibility and extendability of lexicon formats, scaling up prototype lexical systems, 
and acquisition of lexical knowledge, and observe how these inter-relate during the 
process of designing lexical components for realistic natural language processing 
systems.

Current Issues in Computational Lexical Semantics 
James Pustejovsky 
Brandeis University 
Waltham, MA. USA 
Abstract 
In this talk I would like to address ome issues of major importance in lexical semantics. In particular, I
will discuss four topics relating to current research in the field: methodology, descriptive coverage, 
adequacy of the representation, and the computational usefulness of representations. In addressing these 
issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics 
community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Finally, I outline a theory of lexical 
semantics embodying a richer notion of compositionality, termed cocomposition, which aims to spread 
the semantic load more evenly throughout the lexicon. 
1. Introduction 
I believe we have reached an interesting turning point in research, where linguistic studies can be 
informed by computational tools for lexicology as well as an appreciation of the computational 
complexity of large lexical databases. Likewise, computational research can profit from an awareness of 
the grammatical and syntactic distinctions of lexical items; natural language processing systems must 
account for these differences in their lexicons and grammars. The wedding of these disciplines is so 
important, in fact, that I believe it will soon be impossible to carry out serious computational research 
in our field without the help of electronic dictionaries and computational lexicographic resources 
\[Walker, 1986\]. Positioned at the center of this synthesis is the study of word meaning, lexical 
semantics, which is currently witnessing a minor revival. 
Given this, I would like to turn to a few issues that I feel the lexical semantics community should 
address. In particular, I will pose the following four questions: 
1. Has recent work in lexical semantics been methodologically any sounder than the previous work in 
the field? 
2. Do theories being developed today have any broader coverage than the earlier descriptive work? 
3. Do current heories provide any new insights into the representation f knowledge for the global 
structure of the lexicon? 
4. Finally, has recent work provided the computational community with useful resources for parsing, 
generation, and translation research? 
Before answering these questions, I would like to establish two points that will figure prominently in 
our critique of the field. The first is that, without an appreciation of the syntactic structure of a 
language, the study of lexical semantics is bound to fail. There is no way in which meaning can be 
completely divorced from the structure that carries it. This is more a methodological point than 
anything else, since grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic 
theories. 
c~--, - xvii - 
The second point is that the meanings of words should somehow reflect the deeper, conceptual 
structures in the system and the domain it operates in. This is tantamount tostating that the semantics 
of natural language should be the image of (nonlinguistic) conceptual organizing principles (whatever 
their structure). 
Some of the major points I would like to make here are the following. First, a clear notion of semantic 
well-formedness will be necessary in order to characterize a theory of possible word meaning. This may 
entail idealizing the notion of lexical meaning away from other semantic influences. For instance, this 
might suggest that discourse and pragmatic factors should be handled ifferently or separately from the 
semantic ontributions of lexical items in composition (contra \[Hobbs, 1987\]. Although this is not a 
necessary assumption and may in fact be wrong, it may help narrow our focus on what is important for 
lexical semantic descriptions. 
Secondly, lexical semantics must look for representations that are richer than thematic role descriptions 
\[Fillmore, 1968\]. As argued in \[Levin and Rappaport, 1986\], named roles are useful, at best, for 
establishing fairly general mapping strategies to the syntactic structures in language. The distinctions 
possible with "theta" roles are much too coarse-grained toprovide a useful semantic interpretation of a 
sentence. What is needed, therefore, is a principled method of lexical decomposition. This presupposes, 
if it is to work at all, (1) a rich, recursive theory of semantic omposition, (2) the notion of semantic 
well-formedness mentioned above, and (3) an appeal to levels of interpretation i the semantics \[Scha, 
1983\]. 
Thirdly, and related to the point above, the lexicon is not just verbs. Recent work has done much to 
clarify the nature of verb classes and the syntactic onstructions that each allows \[Levin, 1985\]. Yet it 
is not clear whether we are any closer to understanding the underlying nature of verb meaning, why the 
classes develop as they do, and what consequences these distinctions have for the rest of the lexicon 
and grammar. The curious thing is that there has been little attention paid to the other lexical categories 
(but see \[Fass, 1988\]. That is, we have little insight into the semantic nature of adjectival predication, 
and even less into the semantics of nominals. Not until all major categories have been studied can we 
hope to arrive at a balanced understanding of the lexicon and the methods of composition. 
2. Methods in Lexical Semantics 
Given what I have said, let us examine the questions presented above in more detail. Because of space, 
I will have little to say concerning question (4) in this short note. First, let us turn to the issue of 
methodology. How can we determine the soundness of our method? Are new techniques available now 
that have not been adequately explored? Very briefly, we can summarize the most essential techniques 
assumed by the field, in some way, as follows (see, for example \[Cruse, 1986\]): 
1. On the basis of categorial distinctions, establish the fundamental differences between the grammatical 
classes; the typicial semantic behavior of a word of category X. 
2. Find distinctions between elements of a word class on the basis of collocation and cooccurrence t sts. 
For example, "dog" and "rock" partition into different classes due to certain features. 
3. Test for distinctions of a grammatical nature on the basis of diathesis; i.e. alternations that are 
realized in the syntax. For example, break vs. cut in (i) and (ii) below \[Hale and Keyser, 1986\]. 
(i) a. The glass broke. 
b. John broke the glass. 
(ii) a. *The bread cut. 
b. John cut the bread. 
- xviii - 
This results in ever-finer distinctions in the semantic and syntactic behavior of verbs. 
4. Test for entailments in the word senses of a word, in different grammatical contexts. The same 
lexical item may carry different entailments in different contexts. For example, "forget" in (i): 
(i) a. John forgot that he locked the door. 
b. John forgot to lock the door. 
Sentence (a) has a factive interpretation of "forget" that (b) does not carry. 
5. Test for the ambiguity of a word. Distinguish between ambiguity and polysemy, (cf. \[Hirst, 1987\], 
\[Fass, 1988\]) and from the accidental nature and the logical nature of ambiguity. For example, the 
ambiguity between the two senses of "bank" in (i) 
and the polysemy in (ii). 
(i) a. the bank of the river 
b. the richest bank in the city 
(ii) a. The bank raised its interest rates yesterday. 
b. The store in next to the bank. 
6. Establish what the compositional nature of a lexical item is when applied to other words. For 
example, "alleged" vs. "tall" in the example below. 
(i) a. the alleged suspect 
b. the tall suspect 
While "tall" is a simple intersective modifier in (b) we must be aware of the intensional behavior of 
adjectives such as "alleged" in (a). 
This just briefly characterizes some of the techniques that have been useful for arriving at pre-theoretic 
notions of word meaning. What has changed over the years are not so much the methods themselves as 
the descriptive details provided by each test. One thing that has changed, however, --and this is 
significant-- is the way computational lexicography has provided stronger techniques and even new 
tools for lexical semantics research: for sense discrimination tasks \[Atldns 1987\]; for constructing 
concept taxonomies \[Amsler 1985, Atldns, Klavans and Boguraev, forthcoming\]; for establishing 
semantic relatedness among word senses \[Wilks et al, 1988\]; as well as for testing new ideas about 
semantic representations \[Boguraev and Pustejovsky, forthcoming\]. 
3. Descriptive Adequacy of Existing Representations 
Turning now to the question of how current theories compare with the coverage of lexical semantic 
data, there are two generalizations that should be made. First, the taxonomic descriptions that have been 
made of verb classes are far superior to the classifications available twenty years ago (see \[Levin, 1985\] 
for review). Using mainly the descriptive vocabulary of \[Talmy, 1975, 1985\] and \[Jackendoff, 1983\], 
fine and subtle distinctions are drawn that were impossible to capture in the earlier primitives-approach 
of \[Schank, 1972, 1975\] or the frame semantics of \[Fillmore, 1968\]. There are two problems with the 
current work, however. Unlike the theories of \[Wilks, 1975\] and \[Quillian, 1968\], there is no general 
coherent view on what the entire lexicon will look like when semantic structures for other major 
categories are studied. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this work embodies a real theory of 
knowledge representation. We can, however, view this research as the first step towards constructing a
theory of lexical semantics which is integrated into a linguistic theory, as well as interpreted in a 
knowledge representation system. 
- xix - 
4. Explanatory Adequacy of  Existing Representations 
Finally, let us turn to the question of whether current theories have changed the way we look at 
representation a d lexicon design. The question here is whether the representations assumed by current 
theories are adequate to account for the richness of natural language semantics. It should be pointed out 
here that a theory of lexical meaning will affect the general design of our semantic theory in several 
ways. If we view the goal of a semantic theory as being able to recursively assign meanings to 
expressions, (accounting for phenomena such as synonymy, antonymy, polysemy, metonymy, etc.), then 
our view of compositionality depends ultimately on what the basic lexical categories of the language 
denote. Conventional wisdom on this point paints a picture of words behaving as either active functors 
or passive arguments \[Montague, 1974\]. But if we change the way which categories can denote, then 
the form of compositionality itself changes. Therefore, if done well, lexical semantics forces us to 
reevaluate the very nature of semantic omposition in language (see, for example \[Keenan and Faltz, 
1985\]). 
In what ways could lexical semantics affect the larger methods of composition in semantics? I 
mentioned above that most of the careful representation work has been done on verb classes. In fact, 
the semantic weight in both lexical and compositional terms usually falls on the verb. This has obvious 
consequences for how to treat lexical ambiguity. For example, consider the verb "bake" in the two 
sentences below. 
(1) a. John baked the potato. 
b. John baked the cake. 
\[Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988\] demonstrate that verbs such as "bake" are ambiguous, with both a 
"change-of-state" sense (la) and a "create" sense (lb). 
A similar ambiguity exists with verbs that allow the resulative construction, shown in (2) and (3), and 
discussed in \[Dowty, 1979\], \[Jackendoff, 1983\], and \[Levin and Rapoport, 1988\]. 
(2) a. Mary hammered the metal. 
b. Mary hammered the metal flat. 
(3) a. John wiped the table. 
b. John wiped the table clean. 
On many views, the verbs in (2) and (3) are ambiguous, related by either a lexical transformation 
\[Levin and Rapoport, 1988\], or a meaning postulate \[Dowty, 1979\]. In fact, given strict requirements on 
the way that a verb can project its lexical information, the verb "run" in (4) will also have two lexical 
entries, depending on the syntactic environment it selects \[Talmy, 1985\], \[Levin and Rappaport, 1989\]. 
(4) a. Mary ran yesterday. 
b. Mary ran to the store yesterday. 
These two verbs differ in their semantic representations, where the "run" in (4b) means "go-to-by- 
means-of-running", while in (4a) it means simply "move-by-running". 
The methodology described above for distinguishing word senses is also assumed by those working in 
more formal frameworks. For example, \[Dowty, 1985\] proposes multiple entries for control and raising 
verbs, and establishes their semantic equivalence with the use of meaning postulates. That is, the verbs 
in (5) and (6) are lexically distinct but semantically related by rules. 
(5) a. It seems that John likes Mary. 
b. John seems to like Mary. 
- XX - 
(6) a. Mary prefers that she come. 
b. Mary prefers to come. 
Given the conventional notions of function application and compositionality, there is little choice but to 
treat all of the above cases as polysemous verbs. Yet, something about the systematicity of such 
ambiguity suggests that a more general, simpler explanation should be possible. By relaxing the 
conditions on how the meaning of a complex expression is derived from its parts, we can, in fact, arrive 
at a very straightforward explanation for cases of "logical polysemy." 
The basic idea is this. Rather than treating the expressions that behave as arguments to a function as 
simple, passive objects, imagine that they are as active in the semantics as the verb itself. The product 
of function application would be sensitive to both the function and its active argument. Something like 
this is suggested in \[Keenan and Faltz, 1985\], as the "Meaning-Form Correlation Principle." 
What I have in mind can best be illustrated by returning to the examples in (1). Rather than having 
two word senses for a verb such as "bake," suppose there is simply one, a "change-of-state." Now, 
assume that "bake" can be lexically specified as a Process verb \[Pustejovsky, 1988\]. It is a general 
property of Processes, that they can shift their "aspectual type" to become a telic event. For example, 
"push the wagon" can shift from a Process to a Transition ("push the wagon to Mary") by general 
principles of event composition (cf. \[Pustejovsky, 1988\]). Assume further, that our semantic theory 
makes a logical distinction between "potatoes" and "cakes" in terms of natural versus artifactual objects. 
Any artifact can be identified with the state of being that object, along with the purpose of the object, 
and other information. Most importantly, however, an artifact has a kind of stative interpretation aspart 
of its meaning. 
Notice that the two senses for "bake" in (1) are the result of compositionality in a richer sense. For 
observe that the "create" sense arises by the same principle of event composition mentioned above. 
Namely, that there is a baking process, and it results in a cake. This is the "create" sense, and it is 
present just in those cases where an artifactual stative is already encoded in the argument (see 
\[Pustejovsky, 1989\] for details). 
In fact, similar principles eem to be operating in the examples mentioned in (2) through (4); namely, 
systematic ambiguity is the result of principles of semantic omposition, rather than lexical ambiguity. I 
will call this particular kind of case "cocompositionality." 
In explaining the behavior of the systematic ambiguity above, I made reference to properties of the 
Noun Phrase that are not typical semantic properties for nouns in linguistics, e.g. artifact, natural kind. 
In \[Pustejovsky, 1989\] and \[Pustejovsky and Anick, 1988\], I suggest that there is a system of relations 
that characterizes the semantics of nominals, very much like the argument structure of a verb. I call this 
the "Qualia Structure", adopting a term from \[Goodman, 1951\]. Essentially, the qualia structure of a 
noun determines its meaning as much as the list of arguments determines a verb's meaning. The 
elements that make up a qualia structure include notions such as "container," space," "surface," 
"figure," artifact," and so on. 
When we combine the qualia structure of a NP with the argument structure of a verb, we begin to see a 
richer notion of compositionality emerging, one that looks very much like object-oriented approaches to 
programming \[Ingria nd Pustejovsky, 1988\]. As an example, consider the two senses of "window" and 
"door" in (7) and (8) below: 
(7) a. John crawled through the window. 
b. The window is closed. 
(8) a. Mary painted the door. 
b. Mary walked through the door. 
¢ 
- xxi  - 
Each noun appears to have two senses: an object denotation, and a portal denotation. We can 
characterize the meaning of such "Double Figure Ground" nominals as a three place relation, roughly 
something like N(Figure,Invert-Figure, Ground), where Figure refers to the artifact itself, Invert-Figure 
refers to the portal, and Ground is a reference constant. The foregrounding or backgrounding of a 
nominal's qualia is very similar to argument structure-changing operations for verbs. That is, in (Sa) 
"paint" applies to the Figure interpretation of "the door," while in (8b), "through" will apply to the 
Invert-Figure interpretation of the same NP. The ambiguity with such nouns is a logical one, one that is 
intimately linked to the semantic representation f the object itself. The qualia structure is a way of 
capturing this fact. 
Having discussed the notion of logical polysemy, let us conclude our brief discussion of lexical 
semantics with the issue of metonymy. Metonymy, where a subpart or related part of an object 
"stands" for the object itself, also poses a problem for standard enotational theories of semantics. For 
example, how can we account for the reference shifts such as those shown in (9)? 
(9) a. Thatcher vetoed the channel tunnel. 
b. Mary enjoyed the book. 
I suggest that these are cases of semantic "type coercion", where the verb has coerced the meaning of a 
term phrase into a different semantic type. In the case of (9a), it is obvious that what is vetoed is some 
proposal relating to the object. In (9b), the book is enjoyed only by virtue of some event or process that 
involves the book, performed by Mary. It might furthermore be reasonable to assume that the qualia 
structure of "book" specifies what the artifact is used for; i.e. reading. Such coercion results in a word 
sense for the NP that I will call "logical metonymy." Roughly, logical metonymy is where a logical 
argument of a semantic type (selected by a function) denotes the semantic type itself. For details see 
\[Pustejovsky, 1989\]. 
Another interesting example involves the possible subjects of causative verbs. These are also cases of 
logical metonymy. Consider the sentences in (10) and (11). 
(10) a. The pictures of himself rightened John. 
b. A cup of coffee in the morning woke John up. 
(11) a. John killed Mary. 
b. The gun killed Mary. 
c. John's stupidity killed Mary. 
d. The war killed Mary. 
e. John's pulling the trigger killed Mary. 
The sentences in (10) illusffate the various syntactic onsequences of metonymy and coercion involving 
experiencer verbs, while those in (11) show the different "metonymic extensions" possible from the 
causing event in a killing. The generalization here is that when a verb selects an event as one of its 
arguments, type coercion to an event will permit a limited range of logical metonymy. 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper I have tried to cover what I believe are currently some of the most interesting issues in 
lexical semantics. I have also tried to outline an approach to meaning where the semantic load is 
spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. This entails a semantic description of noun classes, termed 
a "theory of Qualia," as well as the rules of composition that allow this information to be incorporated 
into the semantic interpretation of larger expressions. Although much of what I have presented is 
incomplete and somewhat programmatic, I firmly believe this approach can help clarify the nature of 
word meaning and compositionality in natural anguage.
