Abstract
We explore Debatepedia, a community-
authored encyclopedia of sociopolitical de-
bates, as evidence for inferring a low-
dimensional, human-interpretable representa-
tion in the domain of issues and positions. We
introduce a generative model positing latent
topics and cross-cutting positions that gives
special treatment to person mentions and opin-
ion words. We evaluate the resulting repre-
sentation’s usefulness in attaching opinionated
documents to arguments and its consistency
with human judgments about positions.
1 Introduction
The social web has evolved into a forum for large
portions of the population to discuss and debate
complex issues of societal importance. Websites like
Debatepedia,1 an online, community-authored ency-
clopedia of debates (§2), seek to organize some of
this exchange into structured information resources
that summarize arguments and link externally to
texts (editorials, blog posts, etc.) that express and
evoke them. Empirical NLP, we propose, has a
role to play in creating a more compact and easily-
interpretable way to understand the opinion space.
In particular, we envision applications to computa-
tional journalism, where there is high demand for
transformation of and pattern discovery in unman-
ageable, unstructured, evolving data (including text)
to inform the public (Cohen et al., 2011).
In this paper, we develop a generative model for
discovering such a representation (§3), using De-
batepedia as a corpus of evidence. We draw in-
spiration from Lin et al. (2008) and Ahmed and
1http://dbp.idebate.org
Xing (2010), who used generative models to infer
topics—distributions over words—and other word-
associated variables representing perspectives or
ideologies. We view topics as lexicons, and propose
that grounding a topic model with evidence beyond
bags of words can lead to more lexicon-like repre-
sentations. Specifically, our generative topic model
grounds topics using the hierarchical organization
of arguments within Debatepedia. Further, we use
named entity recognition as a preprocessing step, an
existing sentiment lexicon to construct an informed
prior, and we incorporate a latent, discrete position
variable that cuts across debates.2
We evaluate the model informally and formally
(§4). Subjectively, the model identifies reasonable
topic and perspective terms, and it associates topics
sensibly with important public figures. In quanti-
tative evaluations, we find the model’s representa-
tion superior to topics from vanilla latent Dirichlet
allocation (Blei et al., 2003) and the joint sentiment
topic model (Lin and He, 2009) in matching external
texts to debates. Further, the position variables can
be used to infer the side of an argument within a de-
bate; our model performs with an accuracy of 86%
on position prediction of the debate argument. The
cross-cutting position variable is not especially con-
sistent with human judgments, suggesting that fur-
ther knowledge sources may be required to improve
interpretability across issues.
2 Data
Debatepedia, like Wikipedia, is constructed by vol-
unteer contributors and has a system of community
2This variable might serve to cluster debate sides according
to “abstract beliefs commonly shared by a group of people,”
sometimes called ideologies (Van Dijk, 1998). We do not claim
that our model infers ideologies (see §4).

moderation. Many of the debate issues covered are
controversial and salient in current public discourse.
Because it is primarily expressed as text, Debatepe-
dia is a corpus of debate topics, but it is organized
hierarchically, with multiple issues in each debate
topic, questions within each issue, and arguments on
two sides of each question. An important feature of
the corpus is the widespread quotation and linking to
external articles on the web, including news stories,
blog postings, wiki pages, and social media forums;
here we use these external articles in evaluation (§4).
Table 1 shows excerpts from a debate page3 from
Debatepedia. Each debate contains “questions,”
which reflect the different aspects of a debate. In this
particular debate, there are 13 questions (2 shown),
ranging from economic benefits to enforceability to
social impacts. For each question, there are two dis-
tinct sides, each with its own set of supporting argu-
ments. Many of these arguments also contains links
to online articles where the quotes are extracted from
(not shown in Table 1). For example, in the second
argument on the “No” side, there is an inline link to
the article written by Congressman Drinan.4
Within a debate topic, the sides cut across differ-
ent questions, aligning arguments together. In gen-

eral, the questions are phrased so that a consistent
“pro” and “con” structure is apparent throughout
each debate, aligned to a high-level question (i.e.,
the “Yes” sides of all the questions are consistent
with the same side of the larger debate). The ex-
ample of Table 1 deviates from this pattern, with the
self-defense “Yes” arguing “no” to the high-level de-
bate question—Should laws be passed to limit gun
ownership further?—and the economic “Yes” argu-
ing “yes” to the high-level question.
Table 2 presents statistics of our corpus.
2.1 Preprocessing
We scraped the Debatepedia website and extracted
the debate, question, argument, and side structure
of the debate topics. We crawled the external
web articles that were linked from the Debatepe-
dia arguments. For the web articles, we extracted
the main text content (ignoring boilerplate elements
such as navigation and advertisments) using Boil-
1859
erpipe (Kohlschu¨tter et al., 2010).5 We tokenized
the text and filtered stopwords.6 We considered both
unigrams and bigrams in our model, keeping all uni-
grams and removing bigram types that appeared less
than 5 times in the corpus. Although our modeling
approach ultimately treats texts as bags of terms (un-
igrams and bigrams), one important preprocessing
step was taken to further improve the interpretabil-
ity of the inferred representation: named entity men-
tions of persons. We identified these mentions of
persons using Stanford NER (Finkel et al., 2005)
and treated each person mention as a single token. In
our qualitative analysis of the model (§4.2), we will
show how this special treatment of person mentions
enables the association of well-known individuals
with debate topics. Though not part of our exper-
imental evaluation in this paper, such associations
are, we believe, an interesting direction for future
applications of the model.
3 Model
Our model defines a probability distribution over
terms7 that are observed in the corpus. Each term
occurs in a context defined by the tuple ?d, q, s, a?
(respectively, a debate, a question within the debate,
a side within the debate, and an argument). At each
level of the hierarchy is a different latent variable:
• Each question q within debate d is associated
with a distribution over topics, denoted ?d,q.8
• Each side s of the debate d is associated with a
position, denoted id,s and we posit a global dis-
tribution ? that cuts across different questions
and arguments. In our experiments, there are
two positions, and the two sides of a debate
are constrained to associate with opposing po-
sitions. As illustrated by Table 1, this assump-
5http://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe
6www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html
7Recall that our model includes bigrams. We treat each un-
igram and bigram token (after filtering discussed in §2.1) as a
separate term.
8In future work, more sharing across questions within a
debate, or more differentiation among the topic distributions
for arguments under a question, might be explored. Wallach
(2006) describes suitable techniques using hierarchical Dirich-
let draws, and Eisenstein et al. (2011) suggests the use of sparse
shocks to log-odds at different levels. Here we work on the
assumption that Debatepedia’s questions are the most topically
coherent level, and work with a single topic mixture at this level.

tion is not always correct, though it tends to
hold most of the time.
• Each term wd,q,s,a,n (n is the position index
of the term within an argument) is associated
with one of five functional term types, denoted
yd,q,s,a,n. This variable is latent, except when it
takes the value “entity” (e) for terms marked as
named entity mentions. When it is not an en-
tity, it takes one of the other four values: “gen-
eral position” (i), “topic-specific position” (o),
“topic” (t), or “background” (b). Thus, every
term w is drawn from one of these 5 types of
bags, and y acts as a switching variable to se-
lect the type of bag.
• For some term types (the ones where y ?
{o, t}), each term wd,q,s,a,n is associated with
one of T discrete topics, as indexed by
zd,q,s,a,n.
Figure 1 illustrates the plate diagram for the
graphical model underlying our approach. The gen-
erative story is given in Figure 2.

apply empirical Bayesian techniques to estimate the
hyperparameters. Motivated by past efforts to ex-
ploit prior knowledge (Zhao et al., 2010; Lin and
He, 2009), we use the OpinionFinder sentiment lex-
icon9 (Wilson et al., 2005) to construct ?i and ?o.
Specifically, terms w in the lexicon were given pa-
rameters ?iw = ?ow = 0.01, and other terms were
given ?iw = ?ow = 0.001, capturing our prior belief
that opinion-expressing terms are likely to be used
in expressing positions. 5,451 types were given a
“boost” through this prior.
Information retrieval has long exploited the ob-
servation that a term’s document frequency (i.e., the
number of documents a term occurs in) is inversely
related its usefulness in retrieval (Jones, 1972). We
encode this in ?b, the prior over the background
term distribution, by setting each value to the log-
arithm of the term’s argument frequency.
The other priors were set to be symmetric: ?e =
0.01 (entity topics), ?t = 0.001 (topics), ? =
50/T = 1.25 (topic mixture coefficients), ? = 0.01
(positions), and ? = 0.01 (functional term types).
Preliminary tests showed that final topics are rela-
tively insensitive to the values of the hyperparame-
ters.
3.2 Inference and Parameter Estimation
Exact inference under this model, like most latent-
variable topic models, is intractable. We apply col-
lapsed Gibbs sampling, a standard approach for such
9http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_
lexicon/
models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).10 The no-
table deviations from typical uses of collapsed Gibbs
sampling are: (i) we jointly sample id,1 and id,2 to
respect the constraint that they differ; and (ii) we
fix the priors, in some cases to be asymmetric, as
discussed in §3.1. We perform Gibbs sampling for
2,000 iterations over the dataset, discarding the first
500 iterations for burn-in, and averaging over every
10th iteration thereafter to get estimates for our term
distributions.
3.3 T andK
In all experiments, we use T = 40 topics andK = 2
positions. We did not extensively explore different
values for T and K; preliminary exploration sug-
gested that interpretability, gauged informally by the
authors, degraded for higher values of either.
4 Evaluation
Recall that the aim of this work is to infer a low-
dimensional representation of debate text. We esti-
mated our model on the Debatepedia debates (not in-
cluding hyperlinked articles), and conducted several
evaluations of the model, each considering a differ-
ent aspect of the goal. We exploit external articles
hyperlinked from Debatepedia described in §2 as
supporting texts for arguments, treating each one’s
association to an argument as variable to be pre-
dicted. Firstly, we evaluate our model on the article
associating task. Secondly, we evaluate our model
on the position prediction task. Then, we compare

qualitative discussion.
4.1 Quantitative Evaluation
4.1.1 Topics
As described in §2, our corpus includes 3,352 ar-
ticles hyperlinked by Debatepedia arguments.11 Our
model can be used to infer the posterior over top-
ics associated with such an article, and we compare
that distribution to that of the Debatepedia article
that links to it. Calculating the similarity of these
distributions, we get an estimate of how closely our
model can associate text related to a debate with the
specific argument that linked to it. We compare with
LDA (Blei et al., 2003), which ignores sentiment,
and the joint sentiment topic (JST) model (Lin and
He, 2009), an unsupervised model that jointly cap-
tures sentiment and topic.12 Using Jensen-Shannon
divergence, we find that our approach embeds these
pairs significantly closer than LDA and JST (also
trained with 40 topics), under a Wilcoxon signed
rank test (p < 0.001). Figure 3 shows the histogram
of divergences between our model, JST, and LDA.
Associating external articles. More challenging,
of course, is selecting the argument to which an
external article should be associated. We used the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between topic distribu-
tions of articles and arguments to rank the latter,
for each article. The mean reciprocal rank scores
(Voorhees, 1999) for LDA, JST, and our model were
11We consider only those articles linked by a single Debate-
pedia argument.
12JST multiplies topics out by the set of sentiment labels, as-
signing each token to both a topic and a sentment. We use the
OpinionFinder lexicon in JST’s prior in the same way it is used
in our model.

0.001). We found the same pattern for MRR@k,
k ? {5, 10, 15, 20, 25,?}, as shown in Figure 4.
It is likely possible to engineer more accurate
models for attaching articles to arguments, but the
attachment task is our aim only insofar as it con-
tributes to an overall assessment of an inferred rep-
resentation’s quality.
4.1.2 Positions
Positional distance by topic. We next consider
the JS divergences of position term distributions by
topic; for each topic t, we consider the divergence
between inferred values for ?o1,t and ?o2,t. Figure 5
shows these measurements sorted from most to least
different; these might be taken as evidence for which
issue areas’ arguments are more lexically distin-
guishable by side, perhaps indicating less common
ground in discourse or (more speculatively) greater
controversy. For example, our model suggests that
debates relating to topics like presidential politics,
foreign policy, teachers, women’s health, religion,
and Israel/Palestine are more heated (within the De-
batepedia community at the time the debates took
place) than those about the minimum wage, Iran as
a nuclear threat, or immigration.
Predicting positions for arguments. We tested
our model’s ability to infer the positions of argu-
ments. In this experiment (only), we held out 3,000
arguments during parameter estimation. The held-
out arguments were selected so that every debate
side maintained at least one argument whose in-
ferred side could serve as the correct answer for the
held-out argument. We then inferred i for each held-
out argument from debate d and side s, given the
parameters, and compared it with the value of id,s
inferred during parameter estimation. The model
achieved 86% accuracy (Table 3 shows the confu-
1862
sion matrix). Note that JST does not provide a base-
line for comparison, since it does not capture debate
sides.

i? = 1 1,272 216
i? = 2 199 1,313
Table 3: Confusion matrix for position prediction on
held-out arguments.
Predicting positions for external articles. We
can also use the model to predict the position
adopted in an external text. For articles linked from
within Debatepedia, we have a gold standard: from
which side of a debate was it linked? After using
the model to infer a position variable for such a text,
we can check whether the inferred position variable
matches that of the argument that links to it. Table 4
shows that our model does not successfully com-
plete this task, assigning about 60% of both kinds
of articles i = 1.
i = 1 i = 2
i? = 1 1,042 623
i? = 2 1,043 644
Table 4: Confusion matrix for position prediction on hy-
perlinked articles.
Genre. We manually labeled 500 of these articles
into six genre categories. We had two annotators for
this task (Cohen’s ? = 0.856). These categories,
in increasing order of average Jensen-Shannon di-
vergence, are: blogs, editorials, wiki pages, news,
other, and government. Figure 6 shows the results.
While the only difference between the first and last
groups are surprising by chance, we are encouraged
by our model’s suggestion that blogs and editori-
als may be more “Debatepedia argument-like” than
news and government articles.
Note that our model is learned only from text
within Debatepedia; it does not observe the text of
external linked articles. Future work might incorpo-
rate this text as additional evidence in order to cap-
ture effects on language stemming from the interac-
tion of position and genre.

were instructed to group the 44 sides of the debates.
The instructions stated:
Our goal is to see what you think about how
the different sides of different debates can be
lined up. You might find it convenient to
think of these in terms of political philoso-
phies, contemporary political party platforms,
or something else. Any of these is fine; we
want you to tell us the grouping you find most
reasonable.
All three annotators (hereafter denoted A1, A2, and
A3) used fairly involved labeling schemes; the an-
notators used 37, 30, and 16 unique labels, respec-
tively.14 A1 used keyword lists to label items; we
coarsened his labels manually by removing or merg-
ing less common keywords (resulting in: Republi-
can, Democrat, science/environment, nanny, politi-
cal reform, fiscal liberal, fiscal conservative, liber-
tarian, Israel, Palestine, and one unlabeled side).
A2 provided a coarse annotation along with each
American politics.
14In a small number of cases, an annotator declined to label
a side. Each unlabeled item received its own cluster.
fine-grained one (liberal, conservative, ?, and two
unlabeled sides). We used 100 samples from our
Gibbs sampler to estimate posteriors for each id,s;
these were always 99% or more in agreement, so we
mapped each debate side into its single most proba-
ble cluster. Recall that the two sides of each debate
must be in different clusters.
Table 5 shows the variation of information mea-
sure (Meila, 2003) for each pairing among the three
annotators and our model. The model agrees with
A2’s coarse clustering most closely, and in fact is
closer to A2’s clustering than A2 is to A3’s; it also
agrees with A2’s coarse clustering better than A2’s
coarse and fine clusterings agree (3.36, not shown

have confidence that the positional dimension is be-
ing captured especially well in this model; for those
debate-sides labeled liberal or conservative by A2,
the best match of our two positions was still only in
agreement only about 60% of the time, and agree-
ment with each human annotator is within the inter-
val of what would be expected if each debate’s sides
were assigned uniformly at random to positions.15
Remarks. Within debates and within topics, the
model uses the position variable to distinguish sides
well. For external text, the model performs well
on articles such as blogs and editorials but on oth-

ful, perhaps due to the less argumentative nature
of other kinds of articles. Noting the vast litera-
ture focusing on ideological positions expressed in
text, we believe this failure suggests (i) that broad-
based positions that hold across many topics may
require richer textual representations (see, e.g., the
“syntactic priming” of Greene and Resnik, 2009),
or (ii) that an alternative representation of positions,
such as the spatial models favored by political sci-
entists (Poole and Rosenthal, 1991), may be more
discoverable. Aside from those issues, a stronger
theory of positions may be required. Such a the-
ory could be encoded in a more informative prior or
weaker independence assumptions across debates.
Finally, exploiting explicitly ideological texts along-
side the moderated arguments of Debatepedia might
also help to identify textual associations with gen-
eral positions (Sim et al., 2013). We leave these di-
rections to future work.
4.2 Qualitative Analysis
Of the T = 40 topics our model inferred, we subjec-
tively judged 37 to be coherent; a glimpse of each is
given in Figure 5. We manually selected six of the
most interpretable topics for further evaluation.
As a generative modeling approach, our model
was designed for the purpose of reducing the dimen-
sionality of the sociopolitical debate space, as evi-
denced by Debatepedia. It is like other topic models
in this regard, but we believe that some effects of our
design choices are noteworthy. Table 6 compares the
positional bigrams of our model to the sentiments in-
ferred by JST. We observe the benefit of our model
in identifying terms associated with positions on so-
cial issues, while JST selects more general sentiment
terms.
1865
Table 7 shows bigrams most strongly associated
with general position distributions ?i and selected
topic-position distributions ?o.16 We see the poten-
tial benefit of multiword expressions. Although we
have used frequent bigrams as a poor man’s approx-
imation to multiword expression analysis, we find
the topic-specific positions terms to be subjectively
evocative. While somewhat internally coherent, we
do not observe consistent alignment across topics,
and the general distributions ?i are not suggestive.
The separation of personal name mentions into
their own distributions, shown for some topics in
Table 8, gives a distinctive characterization of top-
ics based on relevant personalities. Subjectively, the
top individuals are relevant to the subject matter as-
sociated with each topic (though the topics are not
always pure; same-sex marriage and the space pro-
gram are merged, for example).
5 Related Work
Insofar as debates are subjective, our study is related
to opinion mining. Subjective text classification
(Wiebe and Riloff, 2005) leads to opinion mining
tasks such as opinion extraction (Dave et al., 2003),
positive and negative polarity classification (Pang et
al., 2002), sentiment target detection (Hu and Liu,
2004; Ganapathibhotla and Liu, 2008), and feature-
opinion extraction (Wu et al., 2009). The above
studies are conducted mostly on product reviews, a
domain with a simpler opinion landscape and more
concrete rationales for those opinions, compared to
sociopolitical debates.
Generative topic models have been successfully
implemented in opinion mining tasks such as feature
identification (Titov and McDonald, 2008), entity-
topic extraction (Newman et al., 2006), mining con-
tentious expressions and interactions (Mukherjee
and Liu, 2012) and specific aspect-opinion word ex-
traction from labeled data (Zhao et al., 2010). Most
relevant to this research is work on feature-sentiment
extraction (Lin and He, 2009; Mei et al., 2007). Mei
et al. (2007) built on PLSI, which is problematic
for generalizing beyond the training sample. The
JST model of Lin and He (2009) is an LDA-based
topic model in which each word token is assigned
both a sentiment and a topic; they exploited a sen-

timent lexicon in the prior distribution. Our model
is closely related, but introduces a switching vari-
able that assigns some tokens to positions, some to
topics, and some to both. Unlike Lin and He’s senti-
ments, our model’s positions are associated with the
two sides of a debate, and we incorporate topics at
the level of questions within debates.
Some studies have specifically analyzed con-
trastive viewpoints or stances in general discussion
text.Agrawal et al. (2003) used graph mining based
method to classify authors in to opposite camps for
a given topic. Paul et al. (2010) developed an unsu-
pervised method for summarizing contrastive opin-
ions from customer reviews. Abu-Jbara et al. (2012)
and Dasigi et al. (2012) developed techniques to ad-
dress the problem of automatically detecting sub-
groups of people holding similar stances in a dis-
cussion thread.
Several prior studies have considered debates.
Cabrio and Villata (2012) developed a system based
on argumentation theory which recognizes the en-
tailment and contradiction relationships between
two texts. Awadallah et al. (2011) used a debate
corpus as a seed for extracting person-opinion-topic
tuples from news and other web documents and in
later work classified the quotations to specific top-
ics and polarity using language models (Awadal-
lah et al., 2012). Somasundaran and Wiebe (2009)
and Anand et al. (2011) were interested in ideolog-
ical content in debates, relying on discourse struc-
ture and leveraging sentiment lexicons to recognize
stances.
Closer to the methodology we describe, Lin et
al. (2008) presented a statistical model for politi-
cal discourse that incorporates both topics and ide-
ologies; they used debates on the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. Fortuna et al. (2009) showed that it is pos-
sible to isolate a subset of terms from media content
that are informative of a news organization’s bias to-
wards a particular issue. Ahmed and Xing (2010) in-
troduced multi-level latent Dirichlet allocation, and
Eisenstein et al. (2011) introduced sparse additive
generative models, both conceived as extensions to
well-established probabilistic modeling techniques
(Blei et al., 2003); these were applied to debates
and political blog datasets. Our approach builds on
these models (especially the switching variables of
Ahmed and Xing). We go farther in jointly modeling
1866
text across many debates evidenced by the structure
of Debatepedia, thus grounding our models more
solidly in familiar sociopolitical issues, and in mak-
ing extensive use of existing NLP resources.
6 Conclusion
Using text from Debatepedia, we inferred topics and
position term lexicons in the domain of sociopoliti-
cal debates. Our approach brings together tools from
information extraction and sentiment analysis into a
latent-variable topic model and exploits the hierar-
chical structure of the dataset. Our qualitative and
quantitative evaluations show the model’s strengths
and weaknesses.
