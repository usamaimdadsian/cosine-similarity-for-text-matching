We present in this paper a morphological nalyzer and 
generator for French that contains a dictionary of 
700,000 inflected words called DELAF 1, and a full two- 
level system aimed at the analysis of new derivatives. 
Hence, this tool recognizes and generates both correct 
inflected forms of French simple words (DELAF look- 
up procedure) and new derivatives and their inflected 
forms (two-level analysis). Moreover, aclear distinction 
is made between dictionary look-up processes and new 
words analyses in order to clearly identify the analyses 
that involve heuristic rules. 
We tested this tool upon a French corpus of 
1,300 ,000  words with significant results 
(Clemenceau D. 1992). With regards to efficiency, since 
this tool is compiled into a unique transducer, it
provides avery fast look-up procedure (1,100 words per 
second) at a low memory cost (around 1.3 Mb in 
RAM).

This operation leads to the transducer of 1.3Mb with a 
look-up procedure of 1,100 words per second, a sample 
of which is given in the following figure: 
2 Description of the analyzer 
We fhst built the transducer representing all the entries 
of DELAF along with their inflectionnal code. Each 
entry defines apartial function, as in: 
inculpons ~ inculper , V&P l p 
which corresponds to the first person plural in the 
present tense of the verb inculper (to charge someone). 
The union of these 700,000 partial functions leads to 
the transducer DELAF stored in 1Mb with a look-up 
procedme of 1,100 words per second. 
The 70 two-level rules that describe the way 
characteas te changed when prefixes or suffixes are added 
to words are themselves transducers (Karttunen et al., 
1992). The two following two-level rules generate the 
two surface forms co\[nculper and co-inculper when 
adding the prefbt co- to the verb inculper: 
i:i ¢* c o -:0 * 
i:i ~ c o -:- * 
These 70 transducers have been merged into the 
transducer Rules by performing an intersection. 
The two transducers above have been merged with 
four different DAGs, Pref, Suf, DELAS and DELAF A, 
representing respectively a list of prefixes, a list of 
suffixes, the list of canonical forms (inf'mitive form of a 
verb for instance) and the whole list of the 700,000 
inflected forms appearing in DELAF through the 
following formula: 
IDELAF stands for Electronic Dictionary of Inflected Forms 
of the LADL (Courtois, 1990). 
3 Results 
We tested this transducer on a 1,300,000 words corpus 
containing 58,000 different graphical forms. Our 
transducer analyzed 75% of these graphical forms, which 
is 3% more that the transducer of DELAF alone, at a 
speed of 1,100 words per second. Hence, more than 97% 
of the word occurrences of our corpus have been 
analyzed in the following way:

the identity function restricted to L(A). The operators * and
