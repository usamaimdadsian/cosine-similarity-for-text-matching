Abstract
This paper describes a study on the impact of
the original signal (text, speech, visual scene,
event) of a text pair on the task of both man-
ual and automatic sub-sentential paraphrase
acquisition. A corpus of 2,500 annotated sen-
tences in English and French is described, and
performance on this corpus is reported for
an efficient system combination exploiting a
large set of features for paraphrase recogni-
tion. A detailed quantified typology of sub-
sentential paraphrases found in our corpus
types is given.
1 Introduction
Sub-sentential paraphrases can be acquired from text
pairs expressing the same meaning (Madnani and
Dorr, 2010). If the semantic similarity of a text
pair has a direct impact on the quality of the ac-
quired paraphrases, it has, to our knowledge, never
been shown what impact the type of original sig-
nal has on paraphrase acquisition. In this work,
we consider four types of corpora, which we think
are representative of the main types of original
semantic signals: text pairs (roughly, sentences)
originating a) from independent translations of a
text (TEXT), b) from independent translations of a
speech (SPEECH), c) from independent descriptions
of a visual scene (SCENE), and d) from independent
descriptions of some event (EVENT). We will report
the results of experiments on sub-sentential para-
phrase acquisition on all these corpus types in two
languages, English and French, and provide some
answers to the following questions: What types of
paraphrases can be found by human annotators, with
what confidence and in which quantities? How well
can representative paraphrase acquisition systems
perform on each corpus type, and how performance
can be improved through combination? On what
corpus types can performance be improved by using
training material from other corpus types? Our ex-
perimental results will provide several indications of
the differences and complementarities of the corpus
types under study, and will notably show that perfor-
mance on the most readily available corpus type can
be improved by using training data from the set of
all other corpus types.
We will first describe the building procedures
and characteristics of our corpora (section 2), and
then describe our experimental settings for evalu-
ating paraphrase acquisition (section 3.1). Our ex-
periments will first consist of the description (sec-
tion 3.2) and evaluation (section 3.3) of a system
combination on each corpus type and then of our
system provided with additional training data from
the other corpus types (section 3.4). We will finally
briefly review related work (section 4) and discuss
our main findings and future work (section 5).
2 Collection of sentence pair corpora
In this study, we will focus on paraphrase acquisition
from related sentence pairs characteristic of 4 corpus
types, which correspond to different original signal
types of text pairs illustrated by the word alignment
matrices on Figure 1. A corpus for each type has
been collected for 2 languages, English and French,
and comprises 625 sentence pairs per language. We
now briefly describe how each corpus was built.

Figure 1: Example reference alignment matrices for
(from top to bottom) TEXT, SPEECH, SCENE and
EVENT. Sure alignments appear in green or gray (identi-
ties) and possible alignments in yellow.
TEXT For English, we used the MTC corpus1 (de-
scribed in (Cohn et al., 2008)) consisting of sets
of news article translations from Chinese, and for
French the CESTA corpus2 consisting of sets of
news article translations from English. For each
sentence cluster, we selected sentence pairs with
minimal edit distance above an empirically-selected
threshold, covering all clusters first and then select-
ing from already used clusters to reach the target
number of sentence pairs.
e.g. It is estimated that the total annual volume of import
and export will exceed 9 billion US dollars. ? It is an-
ticipated that the annual total foreign trade volume will
exceed US$9 billion.
SPEECH For English, we used two freely avail-
able subtitle files3 of the French movies Le Fabuleux
Destin d’Ame´lie Poulain and Les Choristes, and for
French we used two subtitle files from the Desperate
Housewives TV series. We first aligned each paral-
lel corpus using the algorithm described in (Tiede-
mann, 2007), based on time frames and developed
for bilingual subtitles, we then filtered out sentence
pairs below a minimal edit distance threshold, and
manually removed obvious errors made by the algo-
rithm.
e.g. So he uses the photo booths to remind people what
he looks like. ? He uses those machines to remind the
living of his face.
SCENE We used the Multiple Video Description
Corpus (Chen and Dolan, 2011) obtained from mul-
tiple descriptions of short videos. Similarly to what
we did for TEXT, we selected sentence pairs from
clusters by minimal edit distance above a threshold.
An important fact is that for English we were able
to use what is described as “verified” descriptions.
There were, however, far fewer descriptions avail-
able for French, and none had the “verified” status.
We decided to use this corpus nonetheless, but with
the knowledge that this source for French is of a sub-
stantially lower quality (this corpus type will there-
fore appear as “(SCENE)” in all tables to reflect this).
e.g. a boy is riding on a bicycle fast. ? a boy rides a bike
on a dirt road.

SCENE for French appears within parentheses as we do not consider it of the same quality as the other corpora.
EVENT We used titles of news article clusters
from the Google News4 news aggregation service.
We further refined the clustering algorithm by filter-
ing out article pairs whose publication dates differed
from more than one day. We repeated the same se-
lection procedure as for TEXT and SCENE to have
a maximal cluster coverage and select more similar
pairs first.
e.g. Pigeons Have an Understanding of Numbers on Par
With Primates ? Pigeons Have Numerical Abilities Just
Like Primates
Table 1 provides various statistics for these cor-
pora. The first observation is that TEXT contains sig-
nificantly larger sentences than the other types, more
than twice as long as those of SPEECH. Annotation
was performed following the guidelines proposed by
Cohn et al. (2008)5 using the YAWAT tool (Germann,
2008), except that alignments where not initially ob-
tained automatically so as not to bias our annota-
tors’ work (there were two annotators per language).
The main guidelines that they had to follow were
that sure and possible paraphrases must be distin-
guished, smaller alignments were to be prefered but
any-to-any alignments may be used, and sentences
should be aligned as much as possible. Henceforth,
we will only consider for all reported statistics and
experiments those paraphrases that are not identity
pairs (e.g. (a nice day ? a nice day)), as they are
4http://news.google.com
5See http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/
people/T.Cohn/paraphrase_guidelines.pdf
considered trivial as far as acquisition is concerned.
Table 1 also reports inter-annotator agreement6
values computed on sets of 50 sentence pairs. We
find that acceptable values are obtained for sure
paraphrases, but that low values are obtained for
possible paraphrases. This was somehow expected,
given the many possible interpretations of possible
paraphrases, but was not a problem for our experi-
ments: as we will describe in section 3.1, the evalua-
tion metrics we use will not count them as expected
solutions, but will simply not count them as false
when proposed as candidates.
Table 1 finally shows proportions and absolute
numbers of paraphrases of each type for all corpora.
We find that there are approximately the same to-
tal number of paraphrases for English (16,799) and
French (17,001), but that English corpora collec-
tively have an equivalent number of sure and pos-
sible paraphrases (8,303 vs. 8,496) and French have
more sure paraphrases (11,953 vs. 5,048). This may
be explained by the fact that our annotators worked
independently and that the corpora used have dif-
ferences by nature, as our experiments will show.
Other salient results include the fact that TEXT con-
tains more sure paraphrases in number than the other
corpora, that SPEECH contains relatively more pos-
sible paraphrases than the other corpora, and that
SCENE has significantly fewer paraphrases, both in
proportion and number. In Figure 2 various mea-

Table 2: Percentages of paraphrase classes in 50 randomly selected sentence pairs for reference paraphrases for English
(top) and French (bottom). Classes are illustrated by the following examples: (mutual understanding ? consensus)
(synonymy), (California ? CA) (typography), (letting ? having let) (tense), (Asian Development Bank ? Asian
Bank) (inclusion), (police dispatcher ? woman) (pragmatics), (grief-stricken ? struck with grief ) (syntactic), (Viet-
name ? Vietnam) (morphology), (mortgage ? mortgages) (number).
sures of sentence pair similarities are given. TEXT
contains the most similar sentence pairs according to
all metrics, with EVENT at a similar level on French.
SCENE has sentence pairs that are more similar than
those in SPEECH for English, but this is not the case
for French. While the metrics used can only provide
a crude account of semantic equivalence at the sen-
tence level, these results clearly indicate that trans-
lating from text yields more similar sentences than
translating from speech.
Table 2 provides a typology of paraphrases found
in all our corpora and two languages, where each
class has been quantified with respect to the refer-
ence alignments.7 The main observation here is that
phrasal synonymy (e.g. mutual understanding ?
consensus) is the most present phenomenon. It is
also interesting to note that the EVENT corpus type,
which is easy to collect on a daily basis, contains ref-
erence paraphrases spread over all classes. Lastly, it
is expected that paraphrases in the pragmatics class
(e.g. police dispatcher ? woman) would be diffi-
cult to acquire, as this would often rely on document
context and costly world knowledge.8
7Note that typologies of paraphrases have already been pro-
posed in the literature (e.g. (Culicover, 1968; Vila et al., 2011)),
but that the choice of our classes has been primarily moti-
vated by potential subsequent uses of the acquired paraphrases
(paraphrases could be annotated as belonging to more than one
class). Note also that our experiments will also include results
focused on the synonymy class only (cf. Table 5).
8Reusing such types of paraphrases into applications would
however often be too strongly context-dependent.

3 Bilingual experiments across corpus
types
3.1 Evaluation of paraphrase acquisition
We followed the PARAMETRIC methodology de-
scribed in (Callison-Burch et al., 2008) for assess-
ing the performance of systems on the task of sub-
sentential paraphrase acquisition. In this methodol-
ogy, a set of paraphrase candidates extracted from
a sentence pair is compared with a set of reference
paraphrases, obtained through human annotation, by
computing usual measures of precision (P ) and re-
call (R). The first value corresponds to the propor-
tion of paraphrase candidates, denoted H, produced
by a system and that are correct relative to the ref-
erence set containing sure and possible paraphrases,
denoted Rall. Recall is obtained by measuring the
proportion of the reference set of sure paraphrases,

denoted Rsure, that are found by a system. We also
computed an F-measure value (F1), which consid-
ers recall and precision as equally important. These
values are thus given by the following formulae:
P =
|H ? Rall|
|H|
R =
|H ? Rsure|
|Rsure|
F1 =

P +R
Note that the way the sets Rall and Rsure of refer-
ence paraphrase pairs are defined ensures that para-
phrase pair candidates that include possible refer-
ence paraphrases will not penalize precision while
not increasing recall.
All performance values reported in the follow-
ing sections will be obtained using 10-fold cross-
validation and averaging the results on each sub-test.
All data sets of cross-validation contain 500 sen-
tence pairs per corpus type, and 125 pairs are kept
for development.
3.2 A framework for sub-sentential paraphrase
identification
We now describe the systems that will be tested
on the various corpora described in section 2 using
the methodology described in section 3.1. Follow-
ing (Bouamor et al., 2012), a combination system
is used to automatically weight paraphrase pair can-
didates produced by individual systems using a set
of features aiming at recognizing paraphrases, as il-
lustrated on Figure 3. Four individual systems have
been used and are described below: the reasons for
considering those systems include their free avail-
ability, the possibility of using comparable resources
when relevant for our two languages, and the spe-
cific characteristics of the techniques used.
Statistical learning of word alignments (GIZA)
The GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2004) com-
putes statistical word alignment models of increas-
ing complexity from parallel corpora. It was run
on each monolingual corpus of sentence pairs in
both directions, symmetrized alignments were kept
and classical phrase extraction heuristics were ap-
plied (Koehn et al., 2003), without growing phrases
with unaligned tokens.
Linguistic knowledge on term variation (FASTR)
The FASTR tool (Jacquemin, 1999) spots term vari-
ants in large corpora, where variants are described
through metarules expressing how the morphosyn-
tactic structure of a term variant can be derived
from a given term by means of regular expressions
on morphosyntactic categories. Paradigmatic varia-
tion can also be expressed with constraints between
words, imposing that they be of the same morpho-
logical or semantic family using existing resources
available in our two languages. Variants for all
phrases from one sentence of a pair are extracted
from the other sentence, and the intersection of the
sets for both directions is kept.
Edit rate on word sequences (TERp) The TERp
tool (Snover et al., 2010) can be used to compute an
optimal set of word and phrase edits that can trans-
form one sentence into another one.9 Edit types are
parameterized by one or more weights which were
optimized towards F-measure by hill climbing with
100 random restarts using the held-out data set con-
sisting of 125 sentence pairs for each corpus type.
Translational equivalence (PIVOT) We exploited
the paraphrase probability defined by Bannard and
Callison-Burch (2005) on bilingual parallel corpora.
We used the Europarl corpus10 of parliamentary de-
bates in English and French, consisting of approx-
imately 1.7 million parallel sentences, using each
language as source and pivot in turn. GIZA++
9Note that contrarily to what TERp allows, we did not used
the possibility of using word or phrase equivalents as those are
only made available for English. This type of knowledge is
however captured in part by the FASTR and PIVOT systems.

Phrase pair features – edit distance between paraphrases, stem identity, bag-of-tokens similarity, phrase
length ratio
Sentence pair features – sentence pair similarity (cosine, BLEU, TER, METEOR), relative position of
paraphrases, presence of common tokens at paraphrase boundaries, presence of another paraphrase pair
from each system at paraphrase boundaries, presence of a paraphrase at a different position in the other
sentence
Distributional features – similarity of token context vectors for each phrase of a paraphrase (derived
from counts in the large English-French parallel corpus from WMT’11 (http://www.statmt.org/
wmt11/translation-task.html) (approx. 30 million parallel sentences)

was used for word alignment and phrase transla-
tion probabilities were estimated from them by the
MOSES system (Koehn et al., 2007). For each
phrase of a sentence pair, we built its set of para-
phrases, and extracted its paraphrase from the other
sentence with highest probability. We repeated this
process in both directions, and finally kept for each
phrase its paraphrase pair from any direction with
highest probability.
Automatic validation of candidate paraphrases
Taking the union of all paraphrase pair candidates
from all the above systems for each sentence pair, we
perform a Maximum Entropy two-class classifica-
tion11, which allows us to include features that were
not necessarily exploited or straightforward to ex-
ploit by individual systems to determine the proba-
bility that each candidate is a good paraphrase. More
generally, this allows us to attempt to learn a more
generic characterization of paraphrases, which could
trivially accept any number of systems as inputs.
Positive examples for the classifier are those from
the union of candidates that are also in the reference
set Rsure, while negative examples are the remaining
ones from the union. The features that we used are
summarized in Table 3.
3.3 Experimental results
Results for individual systems, their union and our
validation system trained on each corpus type are
given on Table 4. First, we find that all individual
systems fare better on TEXT, for which more train-
ing data were available and where semantic equiv-

alence of sentence pairs is most likely. EVENT ap-
pears to be the most difficult corpus type, whereas
one could say that being the most readily data source
this is a disapointing result: we will return to this in
section 3.4. In terms of performance on F-measure
per corpus type, GIZA performs best for TEXT and
SPEECH, containing long sentences with possible
repetitions, while TERp performs on par with GIZA
for SCENE and best for EVENT, where equivalences
that are rare at the corpus level are more present.
FASTR achieves a very low recall, showing that the
encoded definitions of term variants do not cover all
types of paraphrases, and also possibly that the lex-
ical resource that it uses has incomplete coverage.
It nonetheless obtains high precision values, most
notably on TEXT. One last comment regarding in-
dividual systems is that PIVOT is by far the most
precise of all the techniques used, but with a recall
much lower than those of GIZA and TERp: as is
the case for FASTR, which makes use of manually-
encoded lexical resources, PIVOT encodes in some
sense some kind of semantic knowledge.12
In all cases, our combination system manages
to increase F-measure substantially over the best
individual system for a corpus type and the sim-
ple union. Improvements are strong on TEXT
(resp. +12.5 and +11.6 on English and French)
and on SPEECH (+11.7 and +11.1) and quite good
on SCENE (+3.2 and +6.4) and on EVENT (+5.4
12Note that the fact that English and French were used as the
pivot for one another may have had some positive effect here,
but, incidentally, the two corpora obtained by translating from
the other language (TEXT and SPEECH) are not those where
PIVOT fares better. The difference observed may however lie in
the higher complexity of the sentences in these corpus types.

number of sure paraphrase examples for both lan-

efficiently use them.
Recall values for the union are quite strong for
all corpus types, ranging from 71.4 (SPEECH in En-

ever, a substantial decrease between the unions and
the results of our combination systems, although
recall values for our systems are roughly between
56 and 67, which may be considered an acceptable
range on such a task. Further study of false neg-
atives should help with engineering new features to
improve paraphrase recognition. Lastly, we note that
precision is in general highest for a specific system
(PIVOT), and reaches high values for our validation
system on TEXT, where we have the most examples
(resp. 68.4 and 74.7 for English and French).
As seen in Table 2, synonymy is the most present
phenomenon in all our corpora; it is also proba-
bly one of the most useful type of knowledge for
many applications. We now therefore focus on this
class, for which all the sure paraphrases in our cor-
pora falling in this class have been annotated. Ta-
ble 5 shows F-measure values for the individual
techniques and our combination systems on all cor-
pus types. We first observe that our combination sys-
tem also always improves here over the best individ-
ual system, albeit not by a large margin on EVENT.

Also, we find that PIVOT performs relatively closer
to GIZA and TERp on TEXT and SPEECH than for
the full set of classes, confirming the intuition that
translational equivalence may be appropriate to rec-
ognize synonymy.
3.4 Experiments across corpus types
To test how different the corpora under study are as
regards paraphrase identification, we now consider
using as additional training data for our classifiers
corpora of the other types, both individually and col-
lectively. Results are given on Table 6.13
13Note that our results are still given by performing cross-
validation averaging over 10 test sets for each tested corpus
type.

Table 6: Evaluation results (F1 scores) for all corpus
types for English (top) and French (bottom) when adding
training material from other corpus types (values with
gray background on the diagonal are when no additional
training data are used). “#ex+” rows indicate numbers of
positive paraphrase examples for each additional corpus
type.
The most notable observation is that EVENT is
substantially improved by using all available addi-
tional training data for English (+10.2), and to a
lesser extent for French (+2.5) . It should be noted
that no individual corpus type, save TEXT, individu-
ally improves results on EVENT, and that results are
yet substantially improved over the use of training
data from TEXT when using all available data, re-
vealing a collective contribution of all corpus types.
The second major observation is that all other cor-
pus types seem to be quite specific in nature, as no
addition of training data from other types yields any
improvement (with the exception of SPEECH on En-
glish), but they often in fact decrease performance.
For instance, SCENE in English is substantially neg-
atively impacted by the use of the numerous exam-
ples of TEXT (-4 in F-measure) and even more when
using all other training data (-9). This underlines
the specific nature of this corpus type: independent
descriptions of the same scene in a video may be
worded with much variation that mostly differ from
that present in other corpus types.
Our main conclusion here is therefore that all our
corpora under study are quite specific in nature, but
that EVENT can benefit from all training data from
the other corpus types. We can further note that the
fact that TEXT is almost not impacted by additional
data may also be explained by the fact that this cor-
pus type contains more than half of the total number
of examples for the two languages. Finally, there are
substantially more positive paraphrase examples for
French (19,427) than for English (12,593).
4 Related work
Over the years, paraphrase acquisition and genera-
tion have attracted a wealth of research works that
are too many to adequatly summarize here: (Mad-
nani and Dorr, 2010) presents a complete and up-
to-date review of the main approaches. Sentential
paraphrase collection has been tackled from specific
resources increasing the probability of sentences be-
ing paraphrases (Dolan et al., 2004; Bernhard and
Gurevych, 2008; Wubben et al., 2009), from com-
parable monolingual corpora (Barzilay and Elhadad,
2003; Fung and Cheung, 2004; Nelken and Shieber,
2006), and even at web scale (Pasc¸a and Dienes,
2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008).
Various techniques have been proposed for para-
phrase acquisition from related sentence pairs
(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003)
and from bilingual parallel corpora (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005; Kok and Brockett, 2010).
The issue of corpus construction for developing and
evaluating paraphrase acquisition techniques are ad-
dressed in (Cohn et al., 2008; Callison-Burch et al.,
2008). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that a study in paraphrase acquisition is con-
ducted on several corpus types and for 2 languages.
Faruqui and Pado´ (2011) study the acquisition of en-
tailment pairs (premise and hypothesis), with ex-
periments in 3 languages and various domains of
newspaper corpora for one language. Although their
work is not directly comparable to ours, they report
that robustness across domains is difficult to achieve.
Laslty, the evaluation of automatically generated
paraphrases has recently received some attention
(Liu et al., 2010; Chen and Dolan, 2011; Met-
zler et al., 2011) although it remains a difficult is-
sue. Application-driven paraphrase generation pro-
vides indirect means of evaluating paraphrase gen-
eration (Zhao et al., 2009). For instance, the field of
Statistical Machine Translation has produced works
showing both the usefulness of human-produced
728
(Schroeder et al., 2009; Resnik et al., 2010) and au-
tomatically produced paraphrases (Madnani et al.,
2008; Marton et al., 2009; Max, 2010; He et al.,
2011) for improving translation performance.
5 Discussion and future work
This work has addressed the issue of sub-sentential
paraphrase acquisition from text pairs. Analogu-
ously to bilingual parallel corpora, which are still
to date the most reliable resources for automatic ac-
quisition of sub-sentential translations, monolingual
parallel corpora are generally regarded as very ap-
propriate for paraphrase acquisition. However, their
low availability makes searching for less parallel
corpora a necessity. In this study, we have attempted
to identify corpora of various degrees of semantic
textual similarity by considering text pairs originat-
ing from various signal types. These signal types
allow various degrees of freedom as to how to for-
mulate a text: a text is read and translated into a dif-
ferent language (TEXT); some speech is listened to
in the context of a visual story and translated into a
different language (SPEECH); some action is looked
at and described (SCENE); and some event that took
place is concisely reported (EVENT).
The results presented in this paper have shown
how these corpora differed in various aspects. First,
they contain varying quantities of paraphrases that
are differently distributed into paraphrase classes.
Individual acquisition techniques, based on statis-
tical learning of word alignments (GIZA), linguis-
tic knowledge on term variation (FASTR), edit rate
on word sequence (TERp), and translational equiv-
alence (PIVOT), for which different performances
were observed among them on the same corpus
type, were shown to achieve different performances
across corpus types. An efficient combination of
candidate paraphrases from these individual tech-
niques exploiting additional features to character-
ize paraphrases has yielded substantial increases in
performance on all corpus types; however, it is in-
teresting to note that the highest amplitude in per-
formance across corpus types was not so much on
recall (amplitude of 10.5 on English and 4.7 on
French) than on precision (amplitude of 33.4 on En-
glish and 34.714 on French). This, some other fac-
14Not considering (SCENE) for French.
tors aside, emphasizes the fact that the correct idenfi-
cation of paraphrases is facilitated when equivalence
of semantic content is more probable. Many works
have accordingly attempted to identify text units that
are as parallel as possible from large corpora, and
the task of measuring semantic textual similarity,
which can find many uses, has received some atten-
tion lately (Agirre et al., 2012). However, it itself
relies on some knowledge on paraphrasing.
Our avenues for future work lie in three main ar-
eas. The first one is to continue our current line of
work and study the impact of additional individual
acquisition techniques and better characterizations
of paraphrases in context, in tandem with working
on identifying parallel text pairs in large corpora.
Another avenue is to start from the output of high
recall techniques and to attempt to characterize the
contexts of possible substitution for candidate para-
phrases from large corpora as a means to acquire
precise paraphrases. As the examples from Table 7
show, some classes of paraphrases, and in particular
in the continuum from our synonymy to pragmat-
ics classes, require the joint acquisition of contextual
information that license substitution. Lastly, we plan
to apply such knowledge in text-to-text applications.
