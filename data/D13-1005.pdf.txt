Abstract
We present a cognitive model of early lexi-
cal acquisition which jointly performs word
segmentation and learns an explicit model of
phonetic variation. We define the model as a
Bayesian noisy channel; we sample segmen-
tations and word forms simultaneously from
the posterior, using beam sampling to control
the size of the search space. Compared to a
pipelined approach in which segmentation is
performed first, our model is qualitatively more
similar to human learners. On data with vari-
able pronunciations, the pipelined approach
learns to treat syllables or morphemes as words.
In contrast, our joint model, like infant learners,
tends to learn multiword collocations. We also
conduct analyses of the phonetic variations that
the model learns to accept and its patterns of
word recognition errors, and relate these to de-
velopmental evidence.
1 Introduction
By the end of their first year, infants have acquired
many of the basic elements of their native language.
Their sensitivity to phonetic contrasts has become
language-specific (Werker and Tees, 1984), and they
have begun detecting words in fluent speech (Jusczyk
and Aslin, 1995; Jusczyk et al., 1999) and learn-
ing word meanings (Bergelson and Swingley, 2012).
These developmental cooccurrences lead some re-
searchers to propose that phonetic and word learning
occur jointly, each one informing the other (Swingley,
2009; Feldman et al., 2013). Previous computational
models capture some aspects of this joint learning
problem, but typically simplify the problem consid-
erably, either by assuming an unrealistic degree of
phonetic regularity for word segmentation (Goldwa-
ter et al., 2009) or assuming pre-segmented input
for phonetic and lexical acquisition (Feldman et al.,
2009; Feldman et al., in press; Elsner et al., 2012).
This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first broad-
coverage model that learns to segment phonetically
variable input into words, while simultaneously learn-
ing an explicit model of phonetic variation that allows
it to cluster together segmented tokens with different
phonetic realizations (e.g., [ju] and [jI]) into lexical
items (/ju/).
We base our model on the Bayesian word segmen-
tation model of Goldwater et al. (2009) (henceforth
GGJ), using a noisy-channel setup where phonetic
variation is introduced by a finite-state transducer
(Neubig et al., 2010; Elsner et al., 2012). This in-
tegrated model allows us to examine how solving
the word segmentation problem should affect infants’
strategies for learning about phonetic variability and
how phonetic learning can allow word segmentation
to proceed in ways that mimic the idealized input
used in previous models.
In particular, although the GGJ model achieves
high segmentation accuracy on phonemic (non-
variable) input and makes errors that are qualitatively
similar to human learners (tending to undersegment
the input), its accuracy drops considerably on phonet-
ically noisy data and it tends to oversegment rather
than undersegment. Here, we demonstrate that when
the model is augmented to account for phonetic vari-
ability, it is able to learn common phonetic changes
42
and by doing so, its accuracy improves and its errors
return to the more human-like undersegmentation
pattern. In addition, we find small improvements
in lexicon accuracy over a pipeline model that seg-
ments first and then performs lexical-phonetic learn-
ing (Elsner et al., 2012). We analyze the model’s
phonetic and lexical representations in detail, draw-
ing comparisons to experimental results on adult and
infant speech processing. Taken together, our results
support the idea that a Bayesian model that jointly
performs word segmentation and phonetic learning
provides a plausible explanation for many aspects of
early phonetic and word learning in infants.
2 Related Work
Nearly all computational models used to explore the
problems addressed here have treated the learning
tasks in isolation. Examples include models of word
segmentation from phonemic input (Christiansen et
al., 1998; Brent, 1999; Venkataraman, 2001; Swing-
ley, 2005) or phonetic input (Fleck, 2008; Rytting,
2007; Daland and Pierrehumbert, 2011; Boruta et
al., 2011), models of phonetic clustering (Vallabha
et al., 2007; Varadarajan et al., 2008; Dupoux et al.,
2011) and phonological rule learning (Peperkamp et
al., 2006; Martin et al., 2013).
Elsner et al. (2012) present a model that is similar
to ours, using a noisy channel model implemented
with a finite-state transducer to learn about phonetic
variability while clustering distinct tokens into lexi-
cal items. However (like the earlier lexical-phonetic
learning model of Feldman et al. (2009; in press))
their model assumes known word boundaries, so
to perform both segmentation and lexical-phonetic
learning, they use a pipeline that first segments using
GGJ and then applies their model to the results.
Neubig et al. (2010) also present a transducer-
based noisy channel model that performs joint in-
ference on two out of the three tasks we consider
here; their model assumes fixed probabilities for pho-
netic changes (the noise model) and jointly infers
the word segmentation and lexical items, as in our
‘oracle’ model below (though unlike our system their
model learns from phone lattices rather than a single
transcription). They evaluate only on phone recogni-
tion, not scoring the inferred lexical items.

joint learner for segmentation, phonetic learning, and
lexical clustering, but the model and inference are
tailored to investigate word-final /t/-deletion, rather
than aiming for a broad coverage system as we do.
3 Model
We follow several previous models of lexical acquisi-
tion in adopting a Bayesian noisy channel framework
(Eq. 1-4; Fig. 1). The model has two components:
a source distribution P (X) over utterances without
phonetic variability X , i.e., intended forms (Elsner et
al., 2012) and a channel or noise distribution T (S|X)
that translates them into the observed surface forms
S. The boundaries between surface forms are then
deterministically removed so that the actual observa-
tions are just the unsegmented string of characters in
the surface forms.

Gx|G0, ?1 ? DP (?1, G0) (2)

The source model is an exact copy of GGJ1: to
generate the intended-form word sequences X , we

sample a random language model from a hierarchi-
cal Dirichlet process (Teh et al., 2006) with char-
acter strings as atoms. To do so, we first draw a
unigram distribution G0 from a Dirichlet process
prior whose base distribution generates intended form
word strings by drawing each phone in turn until the
stop character is drawn (with probability pstop). Then,
for each possible context word x, we draw a condi-
tional distribution on words following that context
Gx = P (Xi = •|Xi?1 = x) using G0 as a prior.
Finally, we sample word sequences x1 . . . xn from
the bigram model.
The channel model is a finite transducer with pa-
rameters ? which independently rewrites single char-
acters from the intended string into characters of the
surface string. We use MAP point estimates of these
parameters; single characters (without n-gram con-
text) are used for computational efficiency. Also for
efficiency, the transducer can insert characters into
the surface string, but cannot delete characters from
the intended string. As in several previous phonolog-
ical models (Dreyer et al., 2008; Hayes and Wilson,
2008), the probabilities are learned using a feature-
based log-linear model. For features, we use all the
unigram features from Elsner et al. (2012), which
check faithfulness to voicing, place and manner of
articulation (for example, for k ? g, active features
are faith-manner, faith-place, output-g and voiceless-
to-voiced).
Below, we present two methods for learning the
transducer parameters ?. The oracle transducer is es-
timated using the gold-standard word segmentations
and intended forms for the dataset; it represents the
best possible approximation under our model of the
actual phonetics of the dataset. We can also estimate
the transducer using the EM algorithm. We first ini-
tialize a simple transducer by putting small weights
on the faithfulness features to encourage phonologi-
cally plausible changes. With this initial model, we
begin running the sampler used to learn word segmen-
tations. After several hundred sampler iterations, we
start re-estimating the transducer by maximum likeli-
hood after each iteration. We regularize our estimates
by adding 200 pseudocounts for the rewrite x ? x
during training (rather than regularizing the weights
for particular features). We also show segment only
results for a model without the transducer component
(i.e., S = X); this recovers the GGJ baseline.
4 Inference
Inference for this model is complicated for two rea-
sons. First, the hypothesis space is extremely large.
Since we allow the input string to be probabilistically
lengthened, we cannot be sure how long it is, nor
which characters it contains. Second, our hypothe-
ses about nearby characters are highly correlated due
to lexical effects. When deciding how to interpret
[w@nt], if we posit that the intended vowel is /2/, the
word is likely to be /w2n/ “one” and the next word
begins with /t/ ; if instead we posit that the vowel
is /O/, the word is probably /wOnt/ “want”. Thus,
inference methods that change only one character at
a time are unlikely to mix well. Since they cannot
simultaneously change the vowel and resegment the
/t/, they must pass through a low-probability inter-
mediate state to get from one state to the other, so
will tend to get stuck in a bad local minimum. A
Gibbs sampler which inserts or deletes a single seg-
ment boundary in each step (Goldwater et al., 2009)
suffers from this problem.
Mochihashi et al. (2009) describe an inference
method with higher mobility: a block sampler for
the GGJ model that samples from the posterior over
analyses of a whole utterance at once. This method
encodes the model as a large HMM, using dynamic
programming to select an analysis. We encode our
own model in the same way, constructing the HMM
and composing it with the transducer (Mohri, 2004)
to form a larger finite-state machine which is still
amenable to forward-backward sampling.
4.1 Finite-state encoding
Following Mochihashi et al. (2009) and Neubig et
al. (2010), we can write the original GGJ model
as a Hidden Semi-Markov model. States in the
HMM, written ST:[w][C], are labeled with the
previous word w and the sequence of characters C
which have so far been incorporated into the current
word. To produce a word boundary, we transition
from ST:[w][C] to ST:[C][] with probability
P (xi = C|xi?1 = w). We can also add the next
character s to the current word, transitioning from
ST:[w][C] to ST:[w][C : s], at no cost (since
the full cost of the word is paid at its boundary, there

probably j but can be d or others with lower probability.
After j can be a word boundary (forming the intended
word j), or another character such as u, @ or other (not
shown) alternatives.
is no cost for the individual characters)2.
In addition to analyses using known words, we
can also encode the uniform-geometric prior over
unknown words using a finite-state machine. We
can choose to select a word from the prior by tran-
sitioning to a state ST:[Geom][] with probability
P (new word|xi?1 = w) immediately after a word
boundary. While inGeom, we can transition to a new
Geom state and produce any character with uniform
probability P (c) = (1?Pstop) 1|C| ; otherwise, we can
end the word, transitioning to ST:[unk .word][],
with probability Pstop.
This construction is also approximate; it ignores
the possibility that the prior will generate a known
word w, in which case our final transition ought to
be to ST:[w][] instead of ST:[unk .word][]. This
approximation means we do not need to add context
to the Geom state to remember the sequence of char-
acters it produced, which allows us to keep only a
single Geom state on the chart at each timestep.
When we compose this model with the channel
model, the number of states expands. Each state must
now keep track of the previous word, what intended
charactersC have been posited and what surface char-
acters S have been recognized, ST:[w][C][S].
2Though not mentioned by Mochihashi et al. (2009) or Neu-
big et al. (2010), this construction is not exact, since transitions
in a Bayesian HMM are exchangeable but not independent (Beal
et al., 2001): if a word occurs twice in an utterance, its probabil-
ity is slightly higher the second time. For single utterances, this
bias is small and easy to correct for using a Metropolis-Hastings
acceptance check (Bo¨rschinger and Johnson, 2012) using the
path probability from the HMM as the proposal.
To recognize the current word, we transition to
ST:[C][][] with probability P (xi = C|xi?1 =
w). To parse a new surface character s by positing
intended character x (note that x might be ), we
transition to ST:[w][C : x][S : s] with probabil-
ity T (s|x). (As above, we pay no cost for our choice
of x, which is paid for when we recognize the word;
however, we must pay for s.) For efficiency, we do
not allow the G0 states to hypothesize different sur-
face and intended characters, so when we initially
propose an unknown word, it must surface as itself.3
4.2 Beam sampler
This machine has too many states to fully fill the chart
before backward sampling, so we restrict the set of
trajectories under consideration using beam sampling
(Van Gael et al., 2008) and simulated annealing.
The beam sampler is closely related to the standard
beam search technique, which uses a probability cut-
off to discard parts of the FST which are unlikely to
figure in the eventual solution. Unlike conventional
beam search, the sampler explores using stochastic
cutoffs, so that all trajectories are explored, but most
of the bad ones are explored infrequently, leading to
higher efficiency.
We design our beam sampler to restrict the set
of potential intended characters at each timestep.
In particular, given a stream of input characters
S = s1 . . . sn, we introduce a set of auxiliary cutoff
variables U = u1 . . . un. The ui variables represent
limits on the probability of the emission of surface
character si; we exclude any hypothesized xi whose
probability of generating si, T (si|xi), is less than
ui. To create a beam sampling scheme, we must de-
vise a distribution for U given a state sequence Q (as
discussed above, the sequence of states encodes the
intended character sequence and the segmentation
of the surface string), Pu(U |Q) and then incorporate
the probability of U into the forward messages.
If qi is the state in Q at which si is generated, and
xi the corresponding intended character, we require
that Pu < T (si|xi); that is, the cutoffs must not
exclude any states in the sequence Q. We define Pu
3Again, this approximation is corrected for by the Metropolis-
Hastings step.
45
as a ?-mixture of two distributions:
Pu(u|si, xi) = ?U [0,min(.05, T (si|xi))]+
(1? ?)T (si|xi)Beta(5, 1e? 5)
The former distribution is quite unrestrictive, while
the latter prefers to prune away nearly all the states.
Thus, for most characters in the string, we do not
permit radical changes, while for a fraction, we do.
We follow Huggins and Wood (2013), who ex-
tended Van Gael et al. (2008) to the case of a non-
uniform Pu, to define our forward message ? as:
?(qi, i) ? P (qi, S0..i, U0..i) (5)
=
?
qi?1
Pu(ui|si, xi)T (si|xi)?(qi?1, i? 1)
This is the standard HMM forward message, aug-
mented with the probability of u. Since Pu(·|si, xi)
is required to be less than T (si|xi), it will be 0 when-
ever T (si|xi) < u; this is how the u variables func-
tion as cutoffs. In practice, we use the u variables to
filter the lexical items that begin at each position i
in advance, using a simple 0/1 edit distance Markov
model which runs faster than our full model. (For ex-
ample, we can quickly check if the current U allows
want as the intended form for wOlk at i; if not, we can
avoid constructing the prefix ST:[xi?1][wa][wO]
since the continuation will fail.)
The algorithm’s speed depends on the size and
uncertainty of the inferred LM: large numbers of
plausible words mean more states to explore. When
inference starts, and the system is highly uncertain
about word boundaries, it is therefore reasonable to
limit the exploration of the character sequence. We
do so by annealing in two ways: as in Goldwater
et al. (2009), we raise P (X) (Eq. 3) to a power t
which increases linearly from .3. To sample from
the posterior, we would want to end with t = 1, but
as in previous noisy-channel models (Elsner et al.,
2012; Bahl et al., 1980) we get better results when we
emphasize the LM at the expense of the channel and
so end at t = 2. Meanwhile, as t rises and we explore
fewer implausible lexical sequences, we can explore
the character sequence more. We begin by setting
the ? interpolation parameter of Pu to 0 to minimize
exploration and increase it linearly to .3 (allowing
the system to change about a third of the characters
on each sweep). This is similar to the scheme for
altering Pu in Huggins and Wood (2013).
4.3 Dataset and metrics
We use the corpus released by Elsner et al. (2012),
which contains 9790 child-directed English utter-
ances originally from the Bernstein-Ratner corpus
(Bernstein-Ratner, 1987) and later transcribed phone-
mically (Brent, 1999). This standard word segmenta-
tion dataset was modified by Elsner et al. (2012) to
include phonetic variation by assigning each token a
pronunciation independently selected from the empir-
ical distribution of pronunciations of that word type
in the closely-transcribed Buckeye Speech Corpus
(Pitt et al., 2007). Following previous work, we hold
out the last 1790 utterances as unseen test data during
development. In the results presented here, we run
the model on all 9790 utterances but score only these
1790. We average results over 5 runs of the model
with different random seeds.
We use standard metrics for segmentation and lex-
icon recovery. For segmentation, we report precision,
recall and F-score for word boundaries (bds), and for
the positions of word tokens in the surface string (srf ;
both boundaries must be correct).
For normalization of the pronunciation variation,
we follow Elsner et al. (2012) in measuring how well
the system clusters together variant pronunciations
of the same lexical item, without insisting that the
intended form the system proposes for them match
the one in our corpus. For example, if the system
correctly clusters [ju] and [jI] together but assigns
them the incorrect intended form /jI/, we can still
give credit to this cluster if it is the one that overlaps
best with the gold-standard /ju/ cluster. To compute
these scores, we find the optimal one-to-one map-
ping between our clusters of pronunciations and the
true lexical entries, then report scores for mapped to-
kens (mtk; boundaries and mapping to gold standard
cluster must be correct) and mapped types4 (mlx).
4Elsner et al. (2012) calls the mlx metric lexicon F, which
is possibly confusing. We map the clusters to a gold-standard
lexicon (plus potentially some words that don’t correspond to
anything in the gold standard) and compute a type-level F-score
on this lexicon.

5 Results and discussion
In the following sections, we analyze how our model
with variability compares to GGJ on noisy data. We
give quantitative scores and also show that qualitative
patterns of errors are often similar to those of human
learners and listeners.
5.1 Clean versus variable input
We begin by evaluating our model as a word seg-
mentation system. (Table 1 gives segmentation and
normalization scores for various models and base-
lines on the 1790 test utterances.) We first confirm
that our inference method is reasonable. The bigram
model without variability (“segment only”) should
have the same segmentation performance as the stan-
dard dpseg implementation of GGJ. This is the case:
dpseg has boundary F of 80.3 and token F of 62.4;
we get 81.6 and 65.4. Thus, our sampler is finding
good solutions, at least for the no-variability model.
We compare segmentation scores between the
“segment only” system and the two bigram models
with transducers (“oracle” and “EM”). While these
systems all achieve similar segmentation scores, they
do so in different ways. “Segment only” finds a so-
lution with boundary precision 73.9% and boundary
recall 91.0% for a total F of 81.6%. The low pre-
cision and high recall here indicate a tendency to
oversegment; when the analysis of a given subse-
quence is unclear, the system prefers to chop it into
small chunks. The bigram models which incorporate
transducers score P : 76.1, R: 83.8 (oracle) and P :
80.1,R: 83.0 (EM), indicating that they prefer to find
longer sequences (undersegment) more.
In previous experiments on datasets without varia-
tion, GGJ also has a strong tendency to undersegment
the data (boundary P : 90.1, R: 80.3), which Gold-
water et al. argue is rational behavior for an ideal
learner seeking a parsimonious explanation for the
data. Undersegmentation occurs especially when ig-
noring lexical context (a unigram model), but to some
extent even in bigram models. Human learners also
tend to learn collocations as single words (Peters,
1983; Tomasello, 2000), and the GGJ model has been
shown to capture several other effects seen in labora-
tory segmentation tasks (Frank et al., 2010). Together,
these findings support the idea that human learners
may behave in important respects like the Bayesian
ideal learners that Goldwater et al. presented.
However, experiments on data with variation have
called these conclusions into question. In particu-
lar, GGJ has previously been shown to oversegment
rather than undersegment as the input grows noisier
(Fleck, 2008), and our results replicate this finding
(oversegmentation for the “segment only” model).
In addition, the GGJ bigram model, which achieves
much higher segmentation accuracy than the unigram
model on clean data, actually performs worse on very
noisy data (Jansen et al., 2013). Infants are known to
track statistical dependencies across words (Go´mez
and Maye, 2005), so it is worrisome that these de-
pendencies hurt GGJ’s segmentation accuracy when
learning from noisy data.
Our results show that modeling phonetic variabil-
ity reverses the problematic trends described above.
Although the models with phonetic variability show
similar overall segmentation accuracy on noisy data
to the original GGJ model, the pattern of errors
changes, with less oversegmentation and more un-
47
dersegmentation. Thus, their qualitative performance
on variable data resembles GGJ’s on clean data, and
therefore the behavior of human learners.
5.2 Phonetic variability
We next analyze the model’s ability to normalize vari-
ations in the pronunciation of tokens, by inspecting
the mtk score. The “segment only” baseline is pre-
dictably poor, F : 44.8. The pipeline model scores
48.8, and our oracle transducer model matches this
exactly. The EM transducer scores better, F : 49.6.
Although the confidence intervals overlap slightly,
the EM system also outperforms the pipeline on the
other F -measures; altogether, these results suggest
at least a weak learning synergy (Johnson, 2008) be-
tween segmentation and phonetic learning.
It is interesting that EM can perform better than
the oracle. However, EM is more conservative about
which sound changes it will allow, and thus tends to
avoid mistakes caused by the simplicity of the trans-
ducer model. Since the transducer works segment-
by-segment, it can apply rare contextual variations
out of context. EM benefits from not learning these
variations to begin with.
We can also compare the bigram and unigram ver-
sions of the model. The unigram model is a rea-
sonable segmenter, though not quite as good as the
bigram model, with boundary F of 76.4 and token
F of 60.9 (compared to 79.8 and 64.4 using the bi-
gram model). However, it is not good at normalizing
variation; its mtk score is comparable to the baseline
at 44.8%5. Although bigram context is only moder-
ately effective for telling where words are, the model
seems heavily reliant on lexical context to decide
what words it is hearing.
5.3 Error analysis
To gain more insight into the differing behavior of
our model versus a pipelined system, we inspect the
intended word strings X proposed by each one in
detail. Below, we categorize the kinds of intended
word strings that the model might propose to span a
given gold-standard word token:

lexical item (e.g., gold intended /ju/, surface

correctly (/dOgi/, surf. [dOg•i], int. /dOgi•@/)
One boundary One boundary correct, the other
wrong (/ju•wa. . ./, surf. [juw], int. /juw/)
Other Not a collocation, both boundaries are wrong
(/du•ju•wa. . ./, surf. [ujuw], int. /ujuw/)
Table 2 shows the distribution over intended word
strings proposed by the “segment only” baseline and
the EM-learned transducer. Both systems propose
a large number of correct forms, and the most com-
mon error category is “wrong form” (lexical error
without segmentation error), an error which could
potentially be repaired in a pipeline system. How-
ever, the remaining errors represent segmentation
mistakes which a pipeline could not repair. Here
the two systems behave quite differently. The EM-
learned transducer analyses 14% of real tokens as
parts of multiword collocations like “doyou”; in an-
other 1.35%, the underlying content word is even
correctly detected. The non-variable system, on the
other hand, analyses 15% of real tokens by splitting
them into pieces. Since infant learners tend to learn
collocations, this supports our analysis that the model
with variation better models human behavior.

Table 3: Forms proposed with frequency > 10 for
gold-standard tokens of “you” in one sample from EM-
transducer and segment-only (GGJ) system.
To illustrate this behavior anecdotally, we present
the distribution of intended word strings spanning
tokens whose gold intended form is /ju/ “you” (Table
3). The EM-learned solution proposes 805 tokens
of /ju/, which is the correct analysis6; the “segment
only” system instead finds varying forms like /jI/,
/jæ/ etc. This is unsurprising and could be repaired
by a suitable pipelined system. However, the EM
system also proposes 239 instances of “doyou”, 88
instances of “youwant”, 54 instances of “areyou” and
several other collocations. The “segment only” sys-
tem finds some of these collocations, split into dif-
ferent versions: for instance 106 instances of /duju/
and 44 of /dujI/. In a pipelined system, we could
combine these variants to find 150 instances— but
this is still 89 instances short of the 239 found when
allowing for variability. The same pattern holds for
“youlike” and “youwant”. Because the non-variable
system must learn each variant separately, it learns
only the most common instances of these long collo-
cations, and analyzes infrequent variants differently.
We also perform this analysis specifically for
words beginning with vowels. Infants show a delay
in their ability to segment these words from continu-
ous speech (Mattys and Jusczyk, 2001; Nazzi et al.,
2005; Seidl and Johnson, 2008), and Seidl and John-
son (2008) suggest a perceptual explanation— initial
vowels can be hard to hear and often exhibit variation
due to coarticulation or resyllabification. Although
our dataset does not contain coarticulation as such, it
should show this pattern of greater variation, which
we hypothesize might lead to difficulty in segmenting
and recognizing vowel-initial words.
The model’s behavior is consistent with this hy-
pothesis (Table 4). Both the “segment only” and
EM transducer models find approximately the same
6Not all the variants are merged, however. jI, jæ, Su etc. are
still occasionally analyzed as separate lexical items.

proportion of vowel-initial tokens, and both systems
do somewhat better on consonant-initial words than
vowel-initial words. The advantage is stronger for
the transducer model, which gets only 41.5% of
vowel-initial tokens correct as opposed to 52.1% of
consonant-initial words. It proposes more colloca-
tions for vowel-initial words (19.2%) than for conso-
nants (12.5%). In cases where they do not propose a
collocation, both systems are somewhat more likely
to find the right boundary of a vowel-initial token
than the left boundary (although again this difference
is larger for the EM system); this suggests that the
problem is indeed caused by the initial segment.
5.4 Phonetic Learning
We next compare phonetic variations learned by the
model to characteristics of infant speech perception.
Infants show an asymmetry between consonants and
vowels, losing sensitivity to non-native vowel con-
trasts by eight months (Kuhl et al., 1992; Bosch
and Sebastia´n-Galle´s, 2003) but to non-native con-
sonant contrasts only by 10-12 months (Werker and
Tees, 1984). The observed ordering is somewhat
puzzling when one considers the availability for dis-
tributional information (Maye et al., 2002), which is
much stronger for stop consonants than for vowels
(Lisker and Abramson, 1964; Peterson and Barney,
1952). Infants are also conservative in generalizing
across phonetic variability, showing a delayed abil-
49
ity to generalize across talkers, affects, and dialects.
They have difficulty recognizing word tokens that are
spoken by a different talker or in a different tone of
voice until 11 months (Houston and Jusczyk, 2000;
Singh et al., 2004), and the ability to adapt to unfa-
miliar dialects appears to develop even later, between
15 and 19 months (Best et al., 2009; Heugten and
Johnson, in press; White and Aslin, 2011).
Similar to infants, our model shows both a vowel-
consonant asymmetry and a reluctance to accept the
full range of adult phonetic variability. Table 5 shows
some segment-to-segment alternations learned in var-
ious transducers. The oracle learns a large amount
of variation (u surfaces as itself only 68% of the
time) involving many different segments, whereas
EM is similar to infant learners in learning a more
conservative solution with fewer alternations over-
all. Moreover, EM appears to identify patterns of
variability in vowels before consonants. It learns a
similar range of alternations for u as in the oracle,
although it treats the sound as less variable than it
actually is. It learns much less variability for con-
sonants; it picks up the alternation of D with s and
z, but predicts that D will surface as itself 91% of
the time when the true figure is only 69%. And it
fails to learn any meaningful alternations involving
k. These results suggest that patterns of variability in
vowels are more evident than patterns of variability
in consonants when infants are beginning to solve the
word segmentation problem.
To investigate the effect of data size on this con-
servativism, we ran the system on 1000 utterances
instead of 9790. This leads to an even more conser-
vative solution, with variations for u but none of the
others (although i and D still vary more than k).
5.5 Segmentation and recognition errors
A particularly interesting set of errors are those that
involve both a missegmentation and a simultaneous
misrecognition, since the joint model is prone to
such errors while the pipelined model is not. Rel-
atively little is known about infants’ misrecognitions
of words in fluent speech, although it is clear that they
find words in medial position harder (Plunkett, 2005;
Seidl and Johnson, 2006). However, adults make
missegmentation/misrecognition errors fairly often,
especially when listening to noisy audio (Butterfield
and Cutler, 1988). Such errors are more common

when the misrecognized word belongs to a prosod-
ically rare class and when the incorrectly hypothe-
sized string contains frequent words (Cutler, 1990);
phonetically ambiguous words are also more com-
monly recognized as the more frequent of two op-
tions (Connine et al., 1993). For the indefinite article
“a” (often reduced to [@]), lexical context is the main
factor in deciding between ambiguous interpretations
(Kim et al., 2012). In rapid speech, listeners have few
phonetic cues to indicate whether it is present at all
(Dilley and Pitt, 2010). Below, we analyze various
misrecognitions made by our system (using the EM
transducer), and find some similar effects.
The easiest cases to analyze are those with no mis-
segmentation: the proposed boundaries are correct,
and the proposed lexical entry corresponds to a real
word7, but not the correct one. Most of them corre-
spond to homophones (Table 6).
Common cases with a missegmentation include it
and is, a and is, it’s and is, who, who’s and whose,
that’s and what’s, and there and there’s. In general,
these errors involve words which sometimes appear
7The one-to-one mapping can be misleading, as it may map
a large cluster to a real word on the basis of one or two tokens if
all other tokens correspond to a different word already used for
another cluster. We manually filter out a few cases like this.

with a morpheme or clitic (which can easily be mis-
segmented as part of something else), words which
differ by one segment, and frequent function words
which often appear in similar contexts. These tenden-
cies match those shown by adult human listeners.
A particularly distinctive set of joint recognition
and segmentation errors are those where an entire
real token is treated as phonetic “noise”— that is, it
is segmented along with an adjacent word, and the
system clusters the whole sequence as a token of
that word. The most common examples are “that’s a”
identified as “that’s”, “have a” identified as “have”,
“sees a” identified as “sees” and other examples in-
volving “a”, a word which also frequently confuses
humans (Kim et al., 2012; Dilley and Pitt, 2010).
However, there are also instances of “who’s in” as
“who’s”, “does it” as “does”, and “can you” as “can”.
6 Conclusion
We have presented a model that jointly infers word
segmentation, lexical items, and a model of phonetic
variability; we believe this is the first model to do
so on a broad-coverage naturalistic corpus8. Our re-
sults show a small improvement in both segmentation
and normalization over a pipeline model, providing
evidence for a synergistic interaction between these
learning tasks and supporting claims of interactive
learning from the developmental literature on infants.
We also reproduced several experimental findings;
our results suggest that two vowel-consonant asym-

metries, one from the word segmentation literature
and another from the phonetic learning literature, are
linked to the large variability in vowels found in nat-
ural corpora. The model’s correspondence with hu-
man behavioral results is by no means exact, but we
believe these kinds of predictions might help guide
future research on infant phonetic and word learning.
