Abstract
We compare the multinomial i-vector
framework from the speech community
with LDA, SAGE, and LSA as fea-
ture learners for topic ID on multinomial
speech and text data. We also compare
the learned representations in their abil-
ity to discover topics, quantified by dis-
tributional similarity to gold-standard top-
ics and by human interpretability. We
find that topic ID and topic discovery are
competing objectives. We argue that LSA
and i-vectors should be more widely con-
sidered by the text processing community
as pre-processing steps for downstream
tasks, and also speculate about speech pro-
cessing tasks that could benefit from more
interpretable representations like SAGE.
1 Introduction
The text processing and speech processing re-
search communities have similar problems and
goals, but the technical approaches in these two
communities develop largely independently. In
this paper we compare dimensionality reduction
techniques on multinomial language data from
the text and speech communities. We consider
a multinomial formulation of the i-vector model
(hereafter “mi-vector” model) from the speech
community (Soufifar et al., 2011), the sparse ad-
ditive generative (SAGE) (Eisenstein et al., 2011)
and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al.,
2003b) topic models from the text community,
and latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester
et al., 1990). Both the mi-vector model and the
SAGE topic model represent a multinomial pa-
rameter vector as the softmax of a sum of vectors,
one of which is a background vector representing
overall word usage in the corpus, and so we might
expect mi-vectors and SAGE to produce similar
results on real-world data. We evaluate these two
recent models and two more conventional mod-
els, LDA and LSA (a term describing a class of
methods based on the singular value decomposi-
tion, or SVD, which is used broadly in both re-
search communities). We assess the similarity of
mi-vectors and SAGE and expose the strengths
and weaknesses of all four learned representations
by evaluating them on the supervised task of topic
identification (topic ID), depicted in Figure 1. We
also evaluate the representations on the unsuper-
vised, less easily-measurable task of topic discov-
ery. As a proxy for controlled human annotations,
we quantify topic discovery performance by dis-
tributional similarity to gold-standard topics.
We use the bag-of-words multinomial represen-
tation of text data, i.e., each document is repre-
sented by a vector of counts over the word vo-
cabulary. For speech data, we use a modern au-
tomatic speech recognition (ASR) system to pro-
duce frame-wise triphone state cluster posteriors
and we take the sum of these posteriors across
all frames in a document to obtain a document-
level vector of triphone state cluster soft counts.
Modern topic ID systems for speech use ASR out-
put instead of a lower-resource representation like
these soft counts to improve performance (Hazen
et al., 2007). ASR word counts are high-resource
and can be viewed as a noisy version of word
counts from text. We wish to assess the relative
performance of our learned representations, not
the quality of the data pre-processing scheme, and
we desire to strengthen our results by evaluating
performance on two distinct views of a corpus.
Hence we break from convention and use triphone
state cluster soft counts as speech data.
While previous work has juxtaposed the mi-
vector model against LDA (Chen et al., 2014;
Morchid et al., 2014), the current study is the
first to provide cross-community evaluations of
mi-vectors and a contemporaneous model from

the text community on both text and speech data.
This study is also novel in its direct application
of the mi-vector model to topic ID and topic dis-
covery, two separate tasks with different motiva-
tions and preferring different types of models, and
in its use of low-resource triphone state cluster
soft counts as speech data for topic ID. The low-
resource setting reflects constraints often faced in
real-world applications, and we report topic ID
performance under limited supervision to better il-
luminate the practical strengths and weaknesses of
the learned representations. Finally, we believe
that the centralized comparison herein of several
prominent learned representations on two comple-
mentary tasks on both text and speech will provide
a useful point of reference for future research.
2 Background
Previous work has compared and composed the
mi-vector model with older dimensionality reduc-
tion techniques, including LDA. Chen et al. (2014)
compared a mi-vector language model against
LDA and other models on the task of spoken doc-
ument retrieval, and found the mi-vector model
to significantly outperform the other models on
words, but not on subwords (syllable pairs), de-
rived from ASR. The syllable pairs are similar in
granularity to the triphone state clusters used as
multinomial speech data in the current work.
Morchid et al. (2014) improved conversation
theme identification by employing LDA and a
Gaussian i-vector model in a pipeline. They learn
LDA models of varying dimensions (numbers of
topics) on ASR output and use them to gener-
ate a suite of feature vectors. The feature vector
for each document-dimension pair is created by
marginalizing over topics according to the docu-
ment’s inferred topic proportions. A Gaussian i-
vector model is then learned on those feature vec-
tors; the i-vectors are normalized and used to iden-
tify document themes via the Bayes decision rule.
Note that we have fundamentally different ap-
proaches, goals and methodology from that of
Morchid et al. (2014). First, in an effort to provide
a scientific comparison of independently created
models, we use multinomial i-vectors, whereas
Morchid et al., focusing on a particular task set-
ting, used traditional Gaussian i-vectors. Simi-
larly, while we treat multiple types of topic mod-
els as goals in their own rights, directly compar-
ing SAGE and LDA, Morchid et al. use LDA as
a pre-processing step to Gaussian i-vectors. Sec-
ond, we use triphone state cluster soft counts in-
stead of ASR word counts, hence our representa-
tion of speech data is significantly lower-resource.
Third, we also evaluate performance on text data,
and where Morchid et al. limit their vocabulary
(from ASR) to 166 task-specific words, we use all
26,606 words present in our training data.
3 Input Representations
Our data is drawn from Part 1 of the Fisher English
speech corpus (Cieri et al., 2004c), which contains
audio recordings (Cieri et al., 2004a) and man-
ual transcriptions (Cieri et al., 2004b) of telephone
conversations. Specifically, we use the topic ID
training and evaluation test subsets defined in prior
work (Hazen et al., 2007). In each conversation in
these subsets of the data, two study participants
are prompted to speak on one of a predefined set
of forty topics. There are 1374 training conver-
sations and 686 test conversations. We represent
each conversation by two documents, one for each
side (speaker), resulting in a training set of 2748
documents and a test set of 1372 documents. The
deep neural network (DNN) used to infer the tri-
phone state cluster posteriors forming the basis of
our speech data was trained on Parts 1 and 2 of the
Fisher English speech corpus (Cieri et al., 2004a;
Cieri et al., 2005); see the supplement for further

The vertical lines are the respective upper bounds (entropy

of the text documents has median 7.2, over seven bits away
from the upper bound of 14.7, thus the text representation
is approximately sparse. The speech distribution has median
11.6, within two bits of the upper bound of 12.9, thus the
speech representation is nearly uniform.
details about our dataset and ASR system.
To quantify the sparsity of the raw text (word
count) and speech (triphone state cluster soft
count) representations, we consider the represen-
tation density (number of non-zero entries) on our
training set. The text representation is sparse, with
median density 292 and maximum 500 (out of
26,606 dimensions); the speech representation is
dense, with median density 7586 and maximum
7591 (out of 7591 dimensions).
To assess approximate sparsity, we plot his-
tograms of the entropy of the normalized multino-
mial views of our training set in Figure 2. The me-
dian entropy for speech is less than two bits away
from the uniform entropy, so the speech data is
neither sparse nor approximately sparse.
Finally, we note that topic occurrence in the
Fisher English training set is unbalanced, with
quartiles (including minimum and maximum) of
6, 18.75, 29.5, 50.25, and 87.
4 Learned Representations
We consider four main dimensionality reduction
models: the mi-vector model from the speech
community, the SAGE and LDA topic models
from the text community, and LSA. The learned
representations we consider explain which words
appear in a document d via a latent, lower-
dimensional representation ?
(d)
. All representa-
tions operate under a bag-of-words assumption.
To compare mi-vectors, topic models and LSA, we
find it useful to formulate each learned representa-
tion as operating on different “areas” or “contexts”
a of a document; such a formulation does not
negate the fundamental bag-of-words assumption.
The four models represent the words that appear
in an area a—either the entire document or each
token—via multinomial-style parameters ?
(a)
.
1,2
Each model consists of K components (e.g., a K-
dimensional affine subspace), and shared param-
eters H
k,v
prescribe the amount of weight each
component k places on each vocabulary word v.
The models construct ?
(a)
by combining H and
?
(d)
; often empirical word statistics m are also
used to stabilize the representations.
4.1 LSA
LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990) factorizes a term-
document matrix by truncated SVD, learning the
projection of the data onto a linear subspace of
fixed rank such that the approximation error of the
reconstructed term-document matrix (as measured
by the Frobenius norm) is minimized. In the basic
version of LSA, SVD is applied to the raw term
counts, giving the low-dimensional representation
?
(d)
=H?
(d)
, (1)
where ?
(d)
is the vector of observed multinomial
counts in document d, H is the matrix of left sin-
gular vectors of the term-document count matrix,
and ?
(d)
is the inferred representation of ?
(d)
. In
practice, LSA is often applied instead to the term-
document matrix weighted by term frequency–
inverse document frequency (tf-idf) in order to
normalize terms by importance. We can also ap-
ply further pre-processing steps, such as term-wise
centering by subtracting the column-wise mean m
of the data, in which case LSA finds an affine sub-
space that approximates the data.
4.2 Mi-vector Model
The original acoustic i-vector model represents
continuous, high-dimensional ASR system state
(namely, Gaussian mixture model supervectors) in
an affine subspace (Dehak et al., 2011). Prior work
has found this dense, low-dimensional representa-
tion to be effective for a number of tasks, including
language recognition (Mart´?nez et al., 2011) and
speaker recognition (Dehak et al., 2011; Garcia-
Romero and Espy-Wilson, 2011).
Recently the i-vector model was augmented for
multinomial observations (Soufifar et al., 2011)
1
Other efforts have modeled documents with interme-
diate granularity, e.g., sentence-level (Titov and McDonald,
2008) or entity-level (Newman et al., 2006) granularity.

For brevity, we use the multinomial distribution and its
parameter interchangeably throughout.
2379
and applied accordingly to language recogni-
tion (Soufifar et al., 2011; McCree and Garcia-
Romero, 2015), speaker recognition (Kockmann
et al., 2010), and spoken document retrieval (Chen
et al., 2014). In this version of the i-vector model
the observations are draws from a multinomial and
the (unnormalized) natural parameters of that dis-
tribution are represented in an affine subspace:
?
(d)
= softmax
(
m+H?
(d)
)
(2)
?
(d)
? N (0, I).
We call this multinomial version of the i-vector
model the mi-vector model. The latent variable
?
(d)
is the multinomial i-vector, or mi-vector. H
is an unconstrained linear transformation. The
bias term m is computed as the log of the l
1
-
normalized background word count vector. The
Gaussian prior on the mi-vector ?
(d)
is effec-
tively an l
2
regularizer; mi-vectors are neither non-
negative nor sparse in general.
Unlike many Bayesian topic models, word oc-
currences in the mi-vector model are i.i.d. draws
from a document-level multinomial ?
(d)
; as in
LSA, each latent component contributes equally to
each word within a given document. Specifically,
in the mi-vector model, the natural parameter vec-
tor of the multinomial for all words in a given doc-
ument is determined by an additive offset from a
background parameter vector.
4.3 Bayesian Discrete Topic Models
Bayesian topic models explain word occurrences
via K latent components H
k
(topics) each drawn
from some prior distribution G. Unlike mi-vectors
and LSA, multinomial topic models are admixture
models: each token n is drawn from a particular
distribution H
k
. Latent token assignment vari-
ables z
(d)
n
, taking integral values between 1 and
K, dictate the token’s topic choice. A document
d controls how often each topic is chosen via the
K-dimension multinomial distribution ?
(d)
. In the
parametric settings we consider, Dirichlet priors
are often placed on ?
(d)
, allowing experimenta-
tion with the topic representation H .

There have been many efforts to provide or induce latent
structure among the topics (Blei et al., 2003a; Li and Mc-
Callum, 2006; Wallach et al., 2009; Paul and Girju, 2010),
but most models ground out to Dirichlet and discrete random
variables.

The hyperparameters ? and ? dictate the infor-
mativeness of the priors over H
k
and ?
(d)
: often
(empirically optimized) symmetric hyperparame-
ters are employed, resulting in a form of Laplace
smoothing during topic estimation. In the current
work, we follow this strategy, noting that there
have been concerted efforts to encode domain or
expert knowledge via the hyperparameters (Gorm-
ley et al., 2012; Paul and Dredze, 2015).
SAGE Topic Model The Sparse Additive Gen-
erative (SAGE) model (Eisenstein et al., 2011)
is a generative Bayesian modeling framework in
which ?
(d,n)
are formed by summing a back-
ground vector and one or more sparse vectors
generated from appropriate priors. The additive
components can reflect the contributions of doc-
uments, aspects, topics, or other factors chosen
by the modeler. A basic SAGE topic model sets
?
(d,n)
= softmax
(
m+H
z

)
, and draws H
k
from some sparsity-inducing distribution G, e.g.,
the Laplace distribution. As m is a shared back-
ground frequency vector, H
k
is the learned resid-
ual frequency vector of topic k.
Replacing the topic assignment in SAGE by its
conditional expectation gives

This modification of the SAGE topic model is
the same as the mi-vector model but with differ-
ent regularization on the representation vector ?
(d)
and l
1
regularization on the basis vectorsH
k
. This
“marginal SAGE” model could be useful in fu-
ture work: the marginalization may mitigate the
problem of topic-switching, yielding a more iden-
tifiable (but perhaps less interpretable) model and
lending to downstream tasks such as topic ID.
LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et
al., 2003b) is a generative Bayesian topic model
similar to SAGE, but in which each topic is drawn
2380
from a Dirichlet prior G rather than a sparsity-
inducing distribution. LDA does not explicitly ac-
count for the background distribution; to account
for this, it is common practice to threshold the vo-
cabulary a priori to remove very common and very
rare words (though in our experiments, we do not
do this). Therefore, ?
(d,n)
is exactly H
z
(d)
n
, and
H
k
? Dirichlet (?).
5 Experiments
We compare these four models of learned repre-
sentations empirically on two distinct tasks, topic
ID and topic discovery. The essential imple-
mentation details of the models are as follows;
further details are provided in the supplement.
We learn the mi-vector model in a maximum a
posteriori framework as in McCree and Garcia-
Romero (2015). Our own C++ implementation of
SAGE, available online,
4
uses approximate mean-
field variational inference, as in Eisenstein et al.
(2011). We learn the LDA model using Gibbs
sampling, implemented in MALLET (McCallum,
2002).
5
We perform LSA using centered tf-idf–
weighted word counts and centered l
2
-normalized
triphone state cluster soft counts. We implement
tf-idf by scaling the raw term count by the log in-
verse document frequency. We apply l
2
normal-
ization rather than tf-idf weighting to the speech
data because it is dense and tf-idf is thus inappro-
priate. On both text and speech, mean-centering
is performed after the respective normalization, as
this pre-processing recipe performed best of all the
variants we tried.
6
For each of the four models, the low-
dimensional real vector ?
(d)
represents a given
document d in our experiments. We also con-
sider two high-dimensional baseline representa-
tions: raw (soft) counts on both the text and
speech data, and, only on the text data, tf-idf–
weighted word counts. These tf-idf weights con-
stitute a high-dimensional learned representation.
5.1 Topic ID
In our first topic ID experiment we evaluate topic
ID error on raw multinomial views of the data. To
our knowledge, we are the first to adopt a multi-

best in topic ID, it yields extremely variable V-measure.
nomial view of triphone state clusters and apply it
to topic ID. In subsequent experiments we explore
the interaction of representation dimension with
each model and dataset, and evaluate relative per-
formance when the classifier is only given a frac-
tion of the available data for training. This latter
configuration is the most interesting, as it reflects
the cost of obtaining supervised data in practice.
Given feature vectors for some representation of
the documents in a corpus, topic ID is performed
in a one-versus-all framework. We use logistic re-
gression as the per-class binary classifier, imple-
mented using LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008). Re-
sults were similar when logistic regression was re-
placed by support vector machines. All document
representations are length-normalized (divided by
their l
2
norm) before they are input to the classi-
fier. Performance is measured by topic ID error,
the error of multi-class prediction where the class
predicted for each document is that of the per-class
classifier that gave it the highest weight. Baseline
performance on the test set (where the baseline
classifier chooses the most prevalent topic in the
training set for all test examples) is 96.2% error.
Note that this error rate differs from the uniform-
at-random classification error rate of 97.5% be-
cause of the uneven distribution of topics.
Document Construction Prior work (Hazen et
al., 2007; Wintrode and Khudanpur, 2014) treated
whole conversations as documents in addition to
separating each conversation into its two sides.
We perform a small topic ID experiment in this
configuration to probe the impact of this design
choice. Ten-fold cross-validation (CV) is used
to tune the logistic regression regularizers. On
the test set, the classifier achieves topic ID error
of 12.4% and 15.6% for whole-conversation and
individual-side text data, respectively, and 20.1%
and 29.5% for whole-conversation and individual-
side speech data, respectively. These results cor-
respond roughly to results listed in Table 3 of
Hazen et al. (2007), specifically, the topic ID er-
ror of 8.2% and 12.4% for whole-conversation
and individual-side transcriptions, respectively,
and 22.9% and 35.3% for whole-conversation and
individual-side triphones derived from ASR lat-
tices, respectively (Hazen et al., 2007). However,
we use logistic regression without feature selec-
tion instead of Na¨?ve Bayes with feature selection,
and we apply our classifier to triphone state cluster
soft counts inferred by a DNN instead of triphone

crepancies in performance with respect to prior
work are due to these differences in experimen-
tal configuration. Our results and those of prior
work show that using whole-conversation docu-
ments instead of individual-side documents make
the topic ID task easier. As a result, we expect that
differences in performance between the different
learned representations will be more clearly pro-
nounced on individual conversation sides and we
restrict the rest of our study to that setting.
Dimensionality Study We perform topic ID
on learned representations at dimensions K ?
{10, 50, 100, 200, 300, 600} on individual conver-
sation sides, using ten-fold cross-validation to
tune the logistic regression regularizers. Figure 3
gives topic ID error results on the test set, vary-
ing K. (Selected values are listed in Table 1.)
In both datasets, as the dimension K increases,
topic ID error decreases, approaching (approxi-
mately) the raw baseline. On text, tf-idf performs
slightly better than the raw representation. LSA is
marginally the best-performing lower-dimensional
learned representation; LDA and mi-vectors per-
form well at some representation sizes, depending
on the data source, but their performance is less
consistent. SAGE performs poorly overall.

Limited Data Study The raw text and speech
representations (multinomial observations) are
very high-dimensional, and the classifier is likely
to overfit to specific components (words or tri-
phone state clusters) in these representations. To
measure this effect and attempt to separate the
predictive power of logistic regression from the
quality of the learned representations in our anal-
ysis, we experiment with reducing the number of
labeled training examples the classifier can use;
we still learn representations on the full (unla-
beled) training set. This experiment represents the
limited-supervision setting in which supervised
data is costly to obtain but unlabeled data abounds.
We run this experiment twice, using ` = 2 and
` = 6 labeled examples per topic, for a total of
80 and 240 classifier training examples, respec-
tively. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to fit the
regularizer; per-class loss coefficients are set ac-
cording to the class prior in the original training
set in order to counteract the artificial balancing
of the classes in the limited-supervision dataset.
We report cross-validation estimates of the topic
ID error on the training set for K = 10 (Figure 4),
K = 100 (Figure 5), and K = 600 (Figure 6). For
K = 100 and K = 600, LSA dominates in the
limited-supervision setting. Mi-vectors perform
as well as or better than other low-dimensional
learned representations at K = 10, and exhibit
mixed performance for larger K. SAGE performs
poorly overall.

We believe that approximately sparse posterior ?(d) val-

performance of SAGE. To examine this we “tested on train”
and analyzed the top topics inferred for each document: while
the highest-weighted topic tended to be consistent, SAGE
infers approximately sparse ?(d) with large variation in the
next four highest-weighted topics (the remaining topics are
assigned trace mass). Second, a phenomenon known as con-
versation drift, explained in Section 3 of the supplement, is so
pronounced in Fisher that the first 25% percent of words of
each conversation side are nearly as predictive as the entire

ter than SAGE, but not as well as mi-vectors. Fi-
nally, tf-idf–weighted word counts perform very
well on text, often achieving the best performance
of all representations, even under limited supervi-
sion (but at the same dimension as the raw data).
5.2 Topic Discovery
To quantitatively assess representations’ potential
for topic discovery we compute their V-measure
against the gold-standard labels. V-measure is an
unsupervised measure of similarity between two
partitions (Rosenberg and Hirschberg, 2007) and
is equivalent to the mutual information normalized
by the sum of the entropy (Becker, 2011).
For all representations, we compute V-measure
between a partition induced by that representation
and the gold-standard topic labels on the test set. A
partition is induced on a representation by assign-
ing each document d to the cluster indexed by the
coordinate of ?
(d)
with highest value (the argmax).
Results of this analysis are displayed in Figure 7.
(Selected values are listed in Table 2.) On the text
data, SAGE dominates the lower-dimensional rep-
resentations, LSA is next best overall, and LDA
and mi-vectors exhibit relatively low performance;
document (Wintrode, 2013). All representations must con-
tend with this drift, but ?(d) sparsity may make SAGE partic-
ularly susceptible. These two issues may make the classifica-
tion we use much less robust.

6 Discussion
We have theoretically and empirically compared
several content-bearing representations of text and
speech from prior work. We have measured the
relative performance of these representations on
topic ID, an easy-to-evaluate task familiar to both
text and speech research communities. We have
also assessed the representations in their ability to
discover the topics inherent in a corpus, a task that
is more prominent in the text community and more
difficult to evaluate. On our subset of the Fisher
English data, these tasks appear to have compet-
ing objectives: the best representations in one task
are not necessarily the best in the other. In partic-
ular, while SAGE yields the worst performance as
a feature learner for topic ID, it is demonstrably
superior to other low-dimensional learned repre-
sentations in topic discovery. We have evaluated
performance in topic discovery by distributional
similarity to gold-standard topics as a proxy for
human-annotated judgments of topic quality, and
briefly compared the interpretability of mi-vectors
and SAGE; future work could pursue expert or
crowd-sourced human evaluations.
In the full-supervision setting of topic ID, the
lower-dimensional learned representations con-
verge in performance to the raw representation as
the dimension K increases. However, if only a
couple of labeled examples per class are available,
2384
reflecting the expense of obtaining labels in prac-
tice, then learned representations generally outper-
form the raw representation, which is more prone
to overfitting. It is surprising that tf-idf performs
so well in the limited supervision setting; it is
learned from the data, but it should be prone to
overfitting due to its high dimensionality. It is
also surprising that SAGE performance on text de-
grades significantly at high dimensions; we sus-
pect this is due to topic switching, but further in-
vestigation is warranted. Overall, though, for topic
ID on word counts or triphone state cluster soft
counts, if labeled data is scarce, we benefit from
training on unsupervised learned representations.
In the V-measure experiment, the documents
were partitioned according to the heaviest coordi-
nate in their representations. This choice of exper-
imental protocol is a nuisance variable in our re-
sults; other partition constructions may yield dif-
ferent conclusions. In particular, the heaviest-
coordinate partition may favor topic models,
whose representations are probability vectors, and
disfavor mi-vectors and LSA, whose representa-
tions may have positive and negative coordinates
encoding general linear combinations.
Within each task, the ranking of the represen-
tations (by performance) is generally consistent
between the text and speech data; however, mi-
vectors often outperform LDA on the speech data,
while LDA often outperforms mi-vectors on the
text data. This may be evidence that the two com-
munities have already independently identified ap-
propriate dimensionality reduction techniques for
their respective data sources. However, our re-
sults support that the speech community can bene-
fit from broader use of sparsity-inducing graphical
models such as SAGE in tasks like spoken topic
discovery and recommendation, in which human-
interpretable representations are desired. The text
community may similarly benefit from parsimo-
nious models such as LSA or mi-vectors in down-
stream tasks; underparametrized mi-vectors per-
form particularly well on text, and future work
may benefit from investigating this setting.
Word counts and triphone state cluster soft
counts provide only one view of text and speech
(respectively), and other input representations may
yield different conclusions. The particular LSA
approach we used for text, based on tf-idf weight-
ing, is not as appropriate for our speech data,
which is dense. Future work could evaluate other
implementations of LSA or use a higher-level
view of speech, such as triphone state cluster n-
grams, that more naturally exhibits sparsity and
lends to tf-idf weighting. In particular, weight-
ing by a likelihood ratio test statistic and apply-
ing a log transform has generated better perfor-
mance in several other tasks (Lapesa and Evert,
2014). Future work could also test our conclusions
on higher-resource views of speech, such as ASR
word counts, or lower-resource views such as mel-
frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
We have provided a brief cross-community
evaluation of learned representations on multi-
nomial text and speech data. Some prior work
has evaluated related learned representations on
text data alone, surveying parameters and tasks
at greater breadth (Lapesa and Evert, 2014; Levy
et al., 2015). A similarly comprehensive evalua-
tion spanning the text and speech research com-
munities would demand great effort but provide a
large and versatile resource. In complement, a de-
tailed, case-by-case analysis of errors made by the
models in our study could illuminate future model-
ing efforts by exposing exactly how and why each
model errs or excels in each task.
7 Conclusion
Topic ID and topic discovery are competing ob-
jectives in our setting: we found that the best-
performing representations per task were the same
whether considering text- or speech-based com-
munications. By evaluating learned representa-
tions from both the text and speech communities
on a common set of data and tasks, we have pro-
vided a framework for better understanding the
topic ID and topic discovery objectives, among
others. More generally, we hope to encourage
cross-community collaboration to accelerate con-
vergence toward comprehensive models of lan-
guage.
