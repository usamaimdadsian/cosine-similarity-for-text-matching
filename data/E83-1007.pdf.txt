ABSTRACT 
We describe a dialogue-handling module used as 
an interface between a vocal terminal and a task- 
oriented device (for instance : a robot manipula- 
ting blocks). This module has been specially desi- 
gned to be implanted on a single board using micro- 
processor, and inserted into the vocal terminal 
which already comprises a speech recognition board 
and a synthesis board. The entire vocal system is 
at present capable of conducting a real time spo- 
ken dialogue with its user. 
I INTRODUCTION 
A great deal of interest is actually being 
shown in providing computer interfaces through dia- 
log processing systems using speech input and out- 
put (Levinson and Shipley, 1979). In the same time, 
the amelioration of the microprocessor technology 
has allowed the implantation of word recognition 
and text-to-speech synthesis systems on single 
boards (Li~nard and Mariani, 1982 ; Gauvain, 1983 ; 
Asta and Li~nard, 1979) ; in our laboratory, such 
modules have been integrated into a compact unit 
that forms an autonomous vocal processor which has 
applications in a number of varied domains : vocal 
command of cars, of planes, office automation and 
computer-aided learning (N~el et al., 1982). 
Whereas most of the present language under- 
standing systems require large computational re- 
sources, our goal has been to implement a dialog- 
handling board in the LIMSI's Vocal Terminal. 
The use of micro-systems introduces memory si- 
ze and real-time constraints which have incited us 
to limit ourselves in the use of presently availa- 
ble computational linguistic techniques. Therefore, 
we have taken inspiration from a simple model of 
semantic network ; for the same reasons, the ini- 
tial parser based on an Augmented Transition Net- 
work (Woods, 1970) and implemented on an IBM 370 
(Memmi and Mariani, 1982) was replaced by another 
less time- and memory-consuming one. 
The work presented herein extends possible 
application fields by allowing an interactive vocal 
relation between the machine and its user for the 
execution of a specific task : the application that 
we have chosen is a man-machine communication with 
a robot manipulating blocks and using a Plan Gene- 
rating System.

II SYNTACTIC PROCESSING 
A. Prediction Device 
Once the acoustic processing of the speech si- 
gnal is performed by the 250 word-based recognition 
board, syntactic analysis is carried out. 
It may be noted that response time and word 
confusions increase with the vocabulary size of 
word recognition systems. To limit the degradation 
of performance, syntactic information is used : 
words that can possibly follow a given word may be 
predicted at each step of the recognition process 
with the intention of reducing vocabulary.

B. Parameters Transfer 
In order to build a representation of the deep 
structure of an input sentence, parameters reque- 
sted by the semant icprocedures must be filled with 
the correct values. The parsing method that we de ~ 
velopped considers the naturel language utterances 
as a set of noun phrases connected with function 
words (prepositions, verbs ...) which specify their 
relationships. At the present time, the set of noun 
phrases is obtained by segmenting the utterance at 
each function word.

III SEMANTIC PROCESSING 
A. S\[stem knowledge data 
The computational semantic memory is inspired 
by the Collins and Quillian model, a hierarchical 
network in which each node represents a concept. 
Properties can be assigned to each node, which al- 
so inherits those of its ancestors. Our choice has 
been influenced by the desire to design a system 
which would be able to easily learn new conceptS ; 
that is, to complete or to modify its knowledge 
according to information coming from a vocal input/ 
output system. 
Each noun of the vocabulary is represented by 
a node in such a tree structure. The meaning of any 
given verb is provided by rules that indicate the 
type of objects that can be related. As far as ad- 
jectives are concerned, they are arranged in exclu- 
sive property groups.

Figure 3. Semantic memory model 
The knowledge-based data (which may be enlar- 
ged by information provided by the vocal channel) 
is complemented by temporary data which chronologi- 
cally contain, in abbreviated form, events evoked 
during the dialogue. 
B. Assertion processin~ 
The small amount of data representing a given 
universe allows us to approach the computational 
treatment of these two complementary and contrary 
components of dialogue: learning and contestation. 
Every time an assertion is proposed by the 
user a procedure parses its semantic validity by 
answering the question "Does this sentence fit with 
the current state of the knowledge data ?". If a 
contradiction is detected, it is pointed out to the 
user who must justify his proposal. If the user 
persists in his declaration, the machine may then 
modify its universe knowledge, otherwise the utte- 
rance is not taken into account. 
When no contradiction is encountered, the pro- 
gram enters into a learning process adding to the 
temporary data or knowledge-based data. 
User : Un poisson poss~de des plumes 
(A fish has got feathers) 
System : J'ai compris ... As-tu quelque chose 
ajouter ? 
(I have understood ... Would you like to 
say something else ?) 
U : Une truite poss~de des ~cailles 
(A trout has got scales) 
S : Je croyais qu'un poisson poss~dait des plumes 
(I thought that a fish had got feathers) 
U : Non (No) 
S : D'accord ... (All right) 
U : Qu'est-ce qu'un poisson ? (What is a fish ?) 
S : C'est un animal qui poss~de des ~cailles 
(It is an animal which has got scales) 
44 
I. Teaching utterances 
These assertions, characterized by the pre- 
sence of a non-action verb, permit both the com- 
plete construction of the semantic network and of 
the concept relation rules specifying the possible 
entities that can serve as arguments for a predi- 
cate. 
Although most of our knowledge results from 
long nurturing and frequent interactions with the 
outside world, it is possible to give an approxi- 
mate meaning to concrete objects and verbs by 
using an elementary syntax. A new concept may be 
taught by filling in its position within the se- 
mantic network and possibly associating it with 
properties that will differentiate it from its 
brother nodes. Concept relation rules can be learn- 
ed, too. 
U : Le caf~ ... (coffee ...) 
S : Qu'est ce qu'un caf~ (What is coffee) 
U : Le caf~ ressemble ~ du lait 
(Coffee looks like milk) 
S : ... 
U : Le caf~ est noir (coffee is black) 
S : Je pense avoir compris ... ~ toi 
(I think that I have understood ...) 
U : Qu'est ce que du caf~ ? (What is coffee ?) 
S : Le caf~ est un liquide noir 
(Coffee is a black liquid) 
U : Tu bois du caf~ (You are drinking coffee) 
S : C'est impossible (It is impossible) 
U : Un ordinateur peut boire un liquide 
(A computer is able to drink a liquid) 
S : C'est bon ... j'ai compris 
(That's right ... I have understood) 
U : Tu bois du caf~ (You are drinking coffee) 
S : D'accord (Okay) 
U : Qui bois du caf~ ? (Who is drinking coffee ?) 
S : Je le bois (I am drinking it) 
2. Descriptive utterances 
Sentences involving an action verb are trans- 
lated into an unambiguous representation which con- 
denses and organizes information into the very same 
form as that of the concept relation rules from 
knowledge data. Therefore, semantic validity can be 
easily tested by a pattern-matching process. A se- 
mantic event reduced to a nested-triplet structure 
and considered as valid is then inserted in the 
dynamic-events memory, and can be requested later 
on by the question-answering process. 
Although the language is limited to a small 
subset of natural French, several equivalent syn- 
tactic structures are allowed to express a given 
event ; in order to avoid storing multiple repre- 
sentations of the same event, paraphrases of a given 
utterance are reduced to a single standard form. 
One of the task effected by a language under- 
standing system consists of recognizing the concepts 
that are evoked inside the input utterances. As 
soon as ambiguities are detected, they are resolved 
through interaction with the user. 
U : Je prends le cube I (I am taking the cube I) 
S : S'agit-il du petit cube I ? 
(Is the small cube I in question ?) 
U : ~ i  (Yes it is) 
S :O .K .  
Relative~ clauses are not represented in the 
canonical form of the utterance in which they 
appear, but they are only used to determine which 
concept is in question.

3. Orders 
Input utterances beginning with an action verb 
specify an order that the machine connected to the 
vocal interface is supposed to execute ; in addi- 
tion to the deep structure of this natural language 
message, a formal command language message is built 
and then sent to the machine. The task universe 
memory is modified in order to reflect the execu- 
tion of a user's command. 
User : Prends la pyramide qui est sur la table et 
pose. la sur le gros cube (grasp the pyramid 
which is on the table and put it on the big 
cube) 
Machine : S'agit-il du gros cube 3 ? 
(are you talking of the big cube 3 ?)

Machine : D'accord (all right)

formal command : ((HOLD PYR2)(ON PYR2 CUB3)) 
User : Qu'ai je fait (What did I do) 
Deep structure : (DO ((YOU) ?) 
Machine : Tu as demand~ que je prenne la petite 
pyramide et que je pose la petite pyra- 
mide sur le gros cube 3 (You have asked 
me to grasp the small pyramid and put 
the small pyramid on the big cube 3) 
User : Qu ia  saisi un objet (Who has taken an 
object) 
Deep structure : (TAKE ( ? (OBJ))) 
Machine : J'ai pris la petite pyramide (I have 
grasped the small pyramid) 
User : Qu'as-tu fait apr~s ? (What have you done 
afterwards ?) 
Deep structure : (DO ((I) ?)) 
Machine : J'ai pos~ la petite pyramide sur le gros 
cube 3 (I put the small pyramid on the 
big cube 3) 
C. Question processing 
In everyday language, intonation often conti- 
tutes the marker that discriminates between ques- 
tions and assertions. Since prosody information is 
not presently taken into account by the word recog- 
nition system, the presence of an interrogative 
pronoun switches on the information research pro- 
cessing in permanent knowledge-data or in dynamic- 
events memory. 
I. Research in permanent knowledge-data 
The program is allowed to express its know- 
ledge at the user's request, for instance, on con- 
cept meanings, or the systems abilities. 
U : Qui es-tu ? (Who are you ?) 
S : Je suis un ordinateur bavard (I am a talkative 
computer) 
U : Puis-je parler avec toi ? 
(Can I speak with you ?) 
S : Oui, c'est possible (Yes, that is possible) 
U : Tu es une souris (You are a mouse) 
S : Je pensais que j'~tais un ordinateur 
(I thought that I was a computer) 
U : C'est faux (That's false) 
S : O.K. 
U : Qui es-tu ? (Who are you ?) 
S : Je suis une souris bavarde 
(I am a talkative mouse) 
U : Est-ce qu'un chat peut parler avec toi ? 
(Is a cat able to speak with you ?) 
S : Bien ~r  que non (Of course not) 
2. Research in d~na~nic-events data 
The abbreviated semantic events list is close- 
ly examined, from recent to older data, until the 
question-pattern approximately matches one of the 
memorized events. Possible analogy between a memo- 
rized event and one evoked by the question is then 
analysed. Coincidences rarely happen, so the system 
must be able to ask for full specifications about 
the event that interests the user ; at that time 
there is a vocal discussion aimed at leading the 
system to that event in a step-wise manner. 
U : Une femme blonde cherche une brosse 
( A blond woman is looking for a brush) 
S : D'accord, je comprends (All right, I under- 
stand) 
U : Je cherche un peigne (I am looking for a comb) 
S : Tr~s int~ressant ... (Very interesting ...) 
U : Quel ~tre humain cherche quelque chose ? 
(What human being is looking for something ?) 
S : S'agit-il de toi ? (Are you talking about 
yourself ?) 
U : Non (No) 
S : S'agit-il d'une femme blonde ? (Are you talking 
about a blond woman ?) 
U : Oui (Yes) 
S : Elle cherche une brosse (She is looking for a 
brush) 
D. Processing a user's incomplete utterance 
An important specific quality of the semantic 
process is that it is able to accomodate bad acous- 
tical recognition through intelligent interactive 
feedback. 
So, when one part of a given sentence has not 
been recognized, because of mispronunciation or 
background noise, the system produces a suitable 
question bringing the user to repeat the unrecogni- 
zed word within his answer. 
Two cases can occur : 
if the word is again unrecognized, the system 
assumes that the entity is not in the prescribed 
vocabulary (containing the acoustic features of 
the words). An explanatory message is then produced 
through the synthesis module. 
if the lexical entity is well recognized this 
time, it is added to the previous utterance and 
computed in the same manner as the others.

U : Qui lit un livre ? (Who is reading a book ?) 
S : Un homme lit un gros livre 
(A man is reading a thick book) 
When a certain amount of acoustical components 
in a sentence have not been recognized, the system 
asks for the user to repeat his assertion. 
U : Le (?) (?) un petit (?) 
s : Peux-tu r~p~ter s'il te plait ? 
E. Sentence production 
1. Translation of a deep structure into an 
output sentence 
This process consists of inserting semantic 
entities into the suitable syntactic diagram which 
depends on the computational procedure that is ac- 
tivated (question answering, contradiction, learn- 
ing, asking for specifications ...). Since each 
syntactic variation of a word corresponds to a sin- 
gle semantic representation, sentence generation 
makes use of verb conjugation procedures and con- 
cordance procedures. 
In order to improve the natural quality of 
speech, different types of sentences expressing one 
same idea may be generated in a pseudo-random man- 
ner. The same question asked to the system several 
times can thus induce different formulated respon- 
ses. 
2. Text-to-speech transcription ambiguities 
A module of the synthesis process takes any 
French text and determines the elements necessary 
for the diphone synthesis, with the help of a dic- 
tionnary containing pronunciation rules and their 
exceptions (Prouts, 1979). However, some ambigui- 
ties concerning text-to-speech transcription can 
still remain and cannot be resolved without syn- 
tactico-semantic information ; for instance : 
"Les poules du couvent couvent" (the convent hens 
are sitting on their eggs) is pronounced by the 
synthesizer : / I £ p u I d y k u v ~ k u v E / 
(the convent hens ~onvent). 
To deal with that problem, we may send the 
synthesizer the phonetic form of the words. 
IV CONCLUSION 
The dialog experiment is presently running on 
a PDP 11/23 MINC and on an INTEL development system 
with a VLISP interpreter in real-time and using a 
series interface with the vocal terminal. 
The isolated word recognition board we are 
using for the moment makes the user pause for appro- 
ximately half a second between each word he pronoun- 
ces. In the near future we plan to replace this 
module by a connected word system which will make 
the dialog more natural. It may be noted that the 
compactness of the understanding program allows its 
implantation on a microprocessor board which is to 
be inserted in the vocal terminal. 
At present we apply ourselves to make the 
dialog-handling module easily adaptable to various 
domains of application.
