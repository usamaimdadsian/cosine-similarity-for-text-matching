Abstract
We present novel experiments in model-
ing the rise and fall of story characteristics
within narrative, leading up to the Most
Reportable Event (MRE), the compelling
event that is the nucleus of the story. We
construct a corpus of personal narratives
from the bulletin board website Reddit,
using the organization of Reddit content
into topic-specific communities to auto-
matically identify narratives. Leveraging
the structure of Reddit comment threads,
we automatically label a large dataset of
narratives. We present a change-based
model of narrative that tracks changes in
formality, affect, and other characteristics
over the course of a story, and we use
this model in distant supervision and self-
training experiments that achieve signifi-
cant improvements over the baselines at
the task of identifying MREs.
1 Introduction
What is a narrative? In one of the early linguis-
tic analyses of storytelling, Prince (1973) defines
a story as describing an event that causes a change
of state. Prince’s minimal story has three parts: the
starting state, the ending state, and the event that
transforms the stating state into the ending state.
An example of a minimal story is as follows:
A man was unhappy, then he fell in love,
then as a result, he was happy.
Polanyi (1976) notes that minimal stories are
toy examples that would never hold an audience’s
interest. So what makes a story interesting?
Labov (1967; 1997) defines a well-formed nar-
rative as a series of actions leading to a Most Re-
portable Event (MRE). The MRE is the point of
the story – the most unusual event that has the
greatest emotional impact on the narrator and the
audience. For a story to be interesting, Prince’s
change-of-state event should be an MRE.
The following is an example of a narrative from
the corpus we create in this work, with the sen-
tence containing the MRE emphasized:
This isn’t exactly creepy, but it’s one of
the scariest things that’s ever happened
to me. I was driving down the motor-
way with my boyfriend in the passenger
seat, and my dad in the seat behind my
own. My dad is an epileptic and his fits
are extremely sporadic. Sometimes he
goes extremely stiff and other times he
will try to get out of places or grab and
punch people. Mid-conversation I felt
his hands wrap around my throat as I
was driving, pulling my head back and
making it increasingly difficult to drive.
My boyfriend managed to help steer the
car into the hard shoulder but it was one
of the scariest experiences in my life.
The MRE is the shortest possible summary of a
story; it is what we would say about the story if
we could only say one thing. If we could identify
the MRE of a narrative, we could automatically
generate summaries or headline-style titles for on-
line stories. Detecting MREs could also allow us
to explore how storytellers build emotional impact
as they lead up to the climaxes of their stories.
In this work, we present a novel approach to
modeling narrative in order to automatically iden-
tify the MRE. The MRE is a real world event un-
derlying the story and thus is difficult to infer; in-
stead, we identify sentences that describe or re-
fer to it. We incorporate Prince’s change-of-state
formalization as well as Labov’s definition of the
MRE by modeling changes in story characteristics
suggested by Prince, Polanyi, and Labov, such as
measures of syntactic complexity and emotional
2149
content. If Prince and Labov are both correct, we
should find the MRE at a point of change in the
story and in our story characteristics.
We create a corpus of thousands of personal
narratives collected from Reddit, a social bul-
letin board website organized into topic-specific
‘subreddit’ communities. We automatically label
most of this data using heuristics based on the
comment-thread structure of Reddit content. Us-
ing this corpus, we conduct two experiments in
classifying sentences of a story as containing the
MRE or not: the first using distant supervision,
and the second using self-training.
In Section 2, we discuss prior work on automati-
cally identifying personal narratives, as well as re-
lated experiments using Labov’s theory of narra-
tive analysis. Section 3 discusses data collection
and labeling. Sections 4-5 present our change-
based model of narrative and our experiments. Fi-
nally, Section 6 discusses our experimental results
and proposes directions for future work.
2 Related Work
Prior work using Labov’s theory of narrative has
focused on classifying clauses by their function.
Rahimtoroghi et al. (2013)worked on 20 of
Aesop’s fables. The 315 clauses were manu-
ally annotated with the three labels of Labov
and Waltezky (1967), Orientation (background in-
formation), Action (events), and Evaluation (au-
thor’s perspective), which we discuss in Section 4.
Rahimtoroghi et al. used two annotators with high
agreement and achieved accuracy and precision
around 0.9 on all three labels, as well as recall
above 0.9 on all but Orientation. They noted that
their data set was very clean: interannotator agree-
ment was nearly perfect, the language was simple,
and each clause served a clear narrative purpose.
Ouyang and McKeown (2014) explored iden-
tifying the Action chain of the oral narratives in
Labov (2013). They used a dataset of 49 narra-
tives (1,277 clauses), transcribed from recordings
of speech and annotated by Labov and achieved
0.72 f-score on classifying clauses as Action or
not. This task is easier than our proposed task
of identifying sentences containing MREs. Ac-
tions account for nearly half the clauses in the
Labov (2013) dataset, while there are only and
average of 2.5 MRE sentences per story. Addi-
tionally, identifying Labov’s Actions is a problem
of detecting causal and temporal relations among
events; identifying the MRE is a problem of mea-
suring how impactful and shocking an event is.
Swanson et al. (2014) used 50 stories, which
were annotated with an extended label set by three
annotators, and each of the 1,602 clauses was as-
signed the label given by the majority of annota-
tors. The extended label set was then mapped to
Labov and Waletzky’s three labels. Nearly half
of the clauses in this dataset are Evaluations, and
Orientations and Actions each make up nearly one
quarter of the dataset. Swanson et al. achieved
0.69 overall f-score on three-way classification of
clauses. Again, this task is less difficult than our
proposed task. The three labels, Orientation, Ac-
tion, and Evaluation have distinct functions that
are reflected in tense, mood, and a clause’s posi-
tion in the narrative. The MRE is not a sentence
or clause but an event that may be described or re-
ferred to by any sentence in a narrative; it is distin-
guished from the other events only by its surpris-
ingness and emotional impact, dimensions that are
difficult to model computationally without a deep
semantic understanding of the story.
The stories that Swanson et al. used were drawn
from a corpus drawn from weblog posts (Gordon
and Swanson, 2009). Gordon and Swanson used
unigram features to classify posts as either stories
or not, achieving 75% precision. They note that
only about 17% of weblog text consists of stories.
In contrast to the relatively small datasets used
by Rahimtoroghi et al., Ouyang and McKeown,
and Swanson et al., we use a larger dataset au-
tomatically collected from Reddit. Our collection
method achieved 94% precision in identifying nar-
ratives. A number of researchers have character-
ized the structure and use of Reddit, currently the
26
th
most popular website in the world
1
. Weninger
et al. (2013) described the structure of Reddit com-
ment threads. Gilbert (2013) measured user par-
ticipation in the voting process that ranks Reddit
content. Singer et al. (2014) conducted a longitu-
dinal study of the Reddit user community, finding
a trend favoring original, user-generated content.
3 Data
3.1 Collection
We collected data from the AskReddit subreddit,
where users post questions for other members of
the community, who reply with comments answer-
ing the questions. Table 1 shows some examples
1
http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com
2150
of these posts, and we can see some of the wide
variety of story topics found on AskReddit.
Post Title
Whats your creepiest (REAL LIFE) story?
Your best “Accidentally Racist” story?
What are your stories of petty revenge?
Table 1: Examples of AskReddit posts.
Using PRAW
2
, we scraped the top 50 AskRed-
dit posts containing the keyword ‘story.’ Of these
posts, 10 were tagged as NSFW (‘not safe for
work’), indicating they contained adult content;
we did not use these posts in this work, as we
felt the language would be too different from that
used in posts without the tag. Another 3 posts did
not contain personal narratives, and instead were
about fictional stories in movies or music.
With the 37 remaining posts, we treated each
top-level comment (those that replied directly to
the posted question) as a story. The example given
in Section 1 is one such story. We collected 6,000
top-level comments and discarded those without
comment threads replying to them. As we discuss
in Section 3.2, we use comment threads to auto-
matically label our training data. We tokenized the
top-level comments by sentence (Bird et al., 2009)
and removed all sentences following any varia-
tion of the word ‘EDIT’, as these were usually re-
sponses to readers’ comments. We discarded texts
with fewer than three sentences, based on Prince’s
definition of a minimal story as consisting of a
starting state, an event, and an ending state. We
are left with 4,896 stories, with an average length
of 16 sentences and a maxiumum of 198.
3.2 Labeling
We partitioned our data into development, seed,
and tuning sets of 100 stories each; a testing set of
200 stories; and a training set of 4,178 stories. The
development, seed, tuning, and testing sets were
manually annotated by a native English speaker
(not one of the authors), who was instructed to
label all sentences that contained or referred to
the MRE. For convenience, from here on, we will
use the term ‘MRE’ to refer to both the Most Re-
portable Event itself (of which there can only be
2
https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/v2.1.20/, Python Reddit
API Wrapper
one per narrative) and to sentences that contain or
refer to it (of which there can be more than one).
To measure interannotator agreement, we also
had a second annotator (also a native English
speaker and not one of the authors) label MREs
in the 100 narratives in our development set. We
found substantial agreement (Cohen’s ? = 0.729);
the two classes, MRE and not-MRE, are highly
unbalanced, so percent agreement between the two
annotators was extremely high (95%).
In addition to labeling the MREs, our first an-
notator identified and discarded 31 texts that were
not true stories, but rather Reddit-specific inside
jokes or comments on how cool the stories in the
thread were. From this, we can see that the pre-
cision of our story collection method is very high.
Gordon et al. (2007) found that stories were 17%
of the weblog text that they collected; of the 500
texts given to our annotators, 94% were stories.
Using the development set, we experimented
with seven heuristics, defined below, for automat-
ically labeling the training set. Each predicts a
sentence index s
h
to be the index of an MRE. We
measured the performance of each heuristic using
root-mean-square error (RMSE), which measures
the standard deviation of how far the heuristic’s
predictions fall from a true MRE.

We used a linear combination of three heuristics
with the lowest RMSE to label our training set.
Similarity to comment. The bag-of-words co-
sine similarity between a sentence and comments
replying to the story. We expect comments to re-
fer to the MRE because of its shocking nature and
importance to the story. This heuristic achieved
RMSE of 5.5 sentences on the development set.
Similarity to tl;dr. The latent semantic simi-
larity between a sentence and the tl;dr. The tl;dr
(too long; didn’t read) is a very short paraphrase
of a post given by its author. They are relatively
rare – 663 stories, or 14% of our data, had tl;drs.
Since the MRE is the central event of the story, we
expect it to be included in the tl;dr. We calculated
the similarity using the weighted matrix factoriza-
tion algorithm described by Guo and Diab (2012).
This heuristic achieved RMSE of 5.8 sentences.
2151
In contrast, bag-of-words cosine similarity to
the tl;dr performed poorly (RMSE of 13.2). This
is due to the tl;dr being both short and a paraphrase
of its story. There are few words in the tl;dr, and
those words are often synonyms of, but not the
same as, words in the story. Guo and Diab’s la-
tent semantic similarity score addresses this word
sparsity problem by modeling words that are not
present in the input text. We also experimented
with latent semantic similarity for the similarity-
to-comment and similarity-to-prompt heuristics,
but in these two cases, it did not perform as well
as the bag-of-words cosine similarity.
Similarity to prompt. The bag-of-words
cosine similarity between a sentence and the
AskReddit post that prompted the story. The story
should be relevant to the prompt, so we expect the
MRE to be similar to the prompt text. This heuris-
tic achieved RMSE of 6.3 sentences.
We used the heuristic with the fourth lowest
RMSE as one of the baselines in our experiments:
Last sentence. The last sentence in the story.
Since the events of a story build up to the MRE,
the MRE should occur near the end of the story.
This heuristic achieved RMSE of 6.9 sentences.
Other heuristics. We also tried the following:
• Single-sentence paragraph (RMSE of 8.7).
This heuristic was meant to capture empha-
sis, as an MRE might be placed in its own,
separate paragraph to draw attention to it.
• First sentence (RMSE of 13.7). Narra-
tives occasionally open with a brief introduc-
tory paragraph that summarizes the events to
come. This heuristic was meant to capture a
reference to the MRE in this introduction.
The training set was automatically labeled using
a linear combination of the three best-performing
heuristics: similarity to comment, similarity to
tl;dr, and similarity to prompt.
h
label
= 0.2 ? h
comment
+ 0.5 ? h
tldr
+ 0.3 ? h
prompt
This outperformed each of the three alone, achiev-
ing an RMSE of 5.1 sentences. The weights for
each heuristic were tuned on the development set.
For stories without a tl;dr, that heuristic was set
to 0. The sentence in the story with the highest
heuristic score was selected as the MRE.
In 52 of the 99 stories in the development
set, we found that multiple, consecutive sentences
were labeled by our annotator as MREs. The av-
erage number of consecutive MREs was 2.5 sen-
tences. To reflect this, we labeled our training set

in three-sentence blocks. The sentence selected
by our labeling heuristic, along with the imme-
diately preceding and following sentences, were
all labeled as MREs. The result was the weakly-
labeled training set in Table 2.
4 Modeling Narrative
Our approach to modeling narrative is based on
both Labov (2013) and Prince (1973). We claim
that Labov’s MRE is Prince’s change of state with
the added requirement of reportability or interest-
ingness – in fact, all three components of Prince’s
minimal story have equivalences in Labov.
Labov and Waletzky (1967) proposed three
components of narrative: the Orientation, which
we equate with Prince’s starting state; the Ac-
tion, the chain of events culminating in the MRE;
and the Evaluation, the author’s perspective on the
story. Labov (2013) adds three more components:
the Resolution, equivalent to Prince’s ending state,
and the Abstract and Coda, where the author intro-
duces and concludes the story.
We focus on Prince’s claim that stories are about
change. Polanyi (1985) observes that the turning
point of a story is marked by a change in style,
formality of language, or emphasis in the telling
of the story. Labov (2013) likewise observes that
a change in verb tense often accompanies MREs.
We hypothesize that the MRE should be found at
a point of change in the story.
We score each sentence according to three
views of narrative: syntax, semantics, and affect.
Syntax. We model Polanyi’s claim that a
change in formality marks the changing point by
including metrics of sentential syntax; we use
the syntactic complexity of a sentence as an ap-
proximation for formality. The complexity of a
sentence also reflects emphasis – short, staccato
sentences bear more emphasis than long, com-
plicated ones. We use the length of the sen-
2152
tence, the length of its verb phrase, and the ra-
tio of these two lengths; the depth of the sen-
tence’s parse tree (Klein and Manning, 2003), the
depth of its verb phrase’s subtree, and the ra-
tio of these two depths. We also use the aver-
age word length for the sentence and the syntactic
complexity formula proposed by Botel and Gra-
nowsky (1972), which scores sentences on spe-
cific structures, such as passives, appositives, and
clausal subjects. Finally, we use the formality and
complexity dictionaries described in Pavlick and
Nenkova (2015), which provide human formal-
ity judgments for 7,794 words and short phrases
and complexity judgments for 5,699 words and
phrases. We score each sentence by averaging
across all words and phrases in the sentence.
Semantics. As the MRE is surprising and
shocking, we expect it to be dissimilar from the
surrounding sentences; we use semantic similarity
to surrounding sentences as a measure of shock.
Our semantic scores are the bag-of-words cosine
and the latent semantic similarity scores for adja-
cent sentences (Guo and Diab, 2012).
Affect. A change in affect reflects a change
in style, and we expect the MRE to occur at an
emotional peak. We use the Dictionary of Af-
fect in Language (DAL) (Whissell, 1989), aug-
mented with WordNet for coverage (Miller, 1995).
The DAL represents lexical affect with three
scores: evaluation (ee, hereafter ‘pleasantness’ to
avoid confusion with Labov’s Evaluation), activa-
tion (aa, activeness), and imagery (ii, concrete-
ness). We also use a fourth score, the activation-
evaluation (AE) norm, a measure of subjectivity
defined by Agarwal et al. (2009):
norm =
?
ee
2
+ aa
2
ii
For each of these four word-level scores, we cal-
culate a sentence-level score by averaging across
the words in the sentence using the finite state ma-
chine described by Agarwal et al. We expect the
sentences surrounding an MRE to be more sub-
jective and emotional as the impact of the MRE
becomes clear. We also expect a build-up in ac-
tiveness and intensity, peaking at the MRE.
To model change over the course of a narrative,
we look for changes in the syntactic, semantic, and
affectual scores. To illustrate this, Figure 1 shows
the activeness and pleasantness DAL scores for the
example narrative given in Section 1. We can see
how the MRE is the most exciting sentence in the

story – global maximum in activation – as well as
the most horrifying – global minimum in pleasant-
ness. The overall shape of the activeness scores
reflects Prince’s three components of a minimal
story: low initial activation (starting state) and low
final activation (ending state) with a build up to a
peak at the MRE (change in state) between them.
5 Experiments
Using our Reddit dataset and change-based model
of narrative, we conducted two experiments on au-
tomatically identifying MREs. We compare our
results with three baselines: random, our labeling
heuristic, and the last sentence of the story ( best-
performing heuristic not used in labeling).
As described in Section 3.2, we labeled our
training set in blocks of three consecutive MREs,
centered on the sentence from each narrative that
was selected by our heuristics. To account for this,
in our experiments and baselines, we predicted the
presence of an MRE in a three-sentence block. In
testing, we considered a predicted block to be cor-
rect if it contained at least one gold-label MRE.
5.1 Features
Change-based Features. For each of the fif-
teen metrics in Section 4, shown in Table 3, we
first smooth the scores by applying a Gaussian fil-
ter. We also tried weighted and exponential mov-
ing averages, as well as a Hamming window, but
the Gaussian performed best in experiments on
our tuning set. We then generate 11 features for
each sentence: the metric score at the sentence;
whether or not the sentence is a local maximum or
minimum; the sentence’s distance from the global

maximum and minimum; the difference in score
between the sentence and the preceding sentence,
the difference between the sentence and the fol-
lowing sentence, and the average of these differ-
ences (approximating the incoming, outgoing, and
self- slopes for the metric); and the incoming,
outgoing, and self- differences of differences (ap-
proximating the second derivative).
Other Features.
• The tense of the main verb and whether or not
there is a shift from the previous sentence.
Labov (2013) suggests a shift between the
past and the historical present near the MRE.
• The position of the sentence in the narrative.
• The bag-of-words cosine similarity and latent
semantic similarity between the sentence and
the first and second sentences in the narra-
tive. The MRE usually appears near the end
of a story, but Labov (2013) notes that the
Abstract, a short introduction that occurs in
some narratives, often refers to the MRE.
5.2 Distant Supervision
Our first experiment used a distant supervision ap-
proach with our automatically-labeled training set.
Distant supervision has previously been applied
to NLP problems such as sentiment analysis (Go
et al., 2009; Purver and Battersby, 2012; Suttles
and Ide, 2013) and relation extraction (Mintz et
al., 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011;
Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011; Krause et al., 2012;
Min et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013).
We classify blocks of three sentences as con-
taining the MRE or not. The two classes, MRE
and not-MRE, were weighted inversely to their fre-
quencies in the weakly-labeled set, and all features
were normalized to the range [0, 1]. We trained an
SVM with margin C = 1 and an RBF kernel with
? = 0.001, chosen using grid search on our tuning
set (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

All features* 0.398 0.745 0.519
Table 4: Distant supervision results (*p < 0.01).
The results of the distant supervision experi-
ment are shown in Table 4. Our best results use
all features, but, notably, using the change-based
features alone achieves significant improvement
over the three baselines (p < 0.00005). The ‘no
change’ trial used the metric scores themselves
and the ‘other’ features but none of the change-
based features, such as slopes and proximity to
global extremes. This feature set was outper-
formed by the random baseline (p < 0.0024), sup-
porting our hypothesis that it is change in a metric,
rather than the score itself, that predicts MREs.
Because we used an non-linear kernel, we were
not able to examine feature weights directly. In-
stead, Table 5 shows the results of a logistic re-
gression model trained on our features. The 10
best features are shown, along with their weights
and 95% confidence intervals. From feature 8, we
see that the MRE is found in sentences near the
narrative’s global minimum in imagery (the Eval-
uation), but feature 1 indicates that sentences con-
taining the MRE show a sharp increase in imagery
compared to the previous sentences. The MRE is
described in a burst of vivid language, followed by
more abstract author opinions .
Features 2 and 9 indicate that the MRE tends to
be described using informal language – a textual
echo to Labov’s observation that the subjects of his
sociolinguistic interviews spoke less formally and
more colloquially as they relived the climaxes of
their stories (Labov, 2013). Feature 3 suggests that
sentences containing the MRE are similar to the
surrounding sentences. While we expected MRE
sentences to be different from their neighbors due
to the unusual and shocking nature of the MRE,
this feature seems instead to reinforce the idea that
MREs tend to described over the course of multi-
ple, consecutive sentences, rather than in a single

mum in activeness, as it is the end of a chain of
events, far away from the stative Orientation.
Finally, features 5 and 10 suggest that MRE sen-
tences are not only long, but much longer than the
preceding sentences, and feature 6 indicates that
MRE sentences are close to the global minimum in
average word length. Shorter average word length
is expected, as an indicator of both informal word
choice and emphasis. Long sentences, however,
suggest a domain difference between our work
on text and Labov’s work on transcribed speech.
Looking over our development set, we find that
many authors combine the description of the MRE
with evaluative material in a single sentence, re-
sulting in a longer and more syntactically complex
MRE sentence than is found in Labov’s data.
5.3 Self-Training
Our second experiment used a self-training ap-
proach, where a classifier uses a small, labeled
seed set to label a larger training set. Self-training
has been applied to parsing (McClosky et al.,
2006; Reichart and Rappoport, 2007; McClosky
and Charniak, 2008; Huang and Harper, 2009;
Sagae, 2010) and word sense disambiguation (Mi-
halcea, 2004). With the same parameters as in
the distant supervision experiment, we trained an
SVM on our hand-labeled seed set of 958 sen-
tences. We used this initial model to relabel the
training set. All sentences where this labeling
agreed with our automatically-generated heuristic
labels were added to the seed set and used to train a
new model, which was in turn used to label the re-
maining sentences, and so on until none of the cur-
rent model’s labels agreed with any of the remain-
ing heuristic labels. Figure 2 shows the learning
curve for the self-training experiment, along with
the growth of the self-training set.

The initial model, trained only on the seed set,
performed nearly as well as our distant supervi-
2155
sion experiment. This illustrates that quantity of
data does not overcome the use of accurate man-
ual labels on a small dataset. As described in Sec-
tion 3.2, the distant supervision labels were based
on a linear combination of three heuristics that
achieved at best an RMSE of 5.1 sentences. How-
ever, with self-training, we can exploit the noisy
heuristic labels by using only those labels that
agree with the seed-trained model, thus reducing
the amount of noise. 52,147 of the 67,954 weakly-
labeled sentences were used in self-training.
6 Discussion and Future Work
Identifying MREs is a hard problem. A human
annotator can rely on world knowledge to find the
most shocking and impactful event in a story, but
we do not have access to that knowledge. Addi-
tionally, MREs are rare, comprising 15% of the
sentences in our hand-annotated datasets. MREs
comprise just over 16% of our weakly-labeled
training set, but as we discuss below, there is too
much noise in the automatically-generated labels.
Despite the difficulty of the task, our ex-
periments show that our change-based model
of narrative is effective for identifying MREs,
and this model provides evidence supporting the
change-in-state view of narrative suggested by
Prince (1973), Polanyi (1985), and Labov (1997).
We achieve high recall with self-training (95%),
but precision is low across the board. This sug-
gests that, while MREs do occur at extremes
in syntactic complexity, semantic similarity, and
emotional activation, there may be many non-
MRE local extremes throughout a narrative.
Examining our results, we find a few common
sources of error. False positive sentences tend to
have high imagery and activeness. In Table 5, we
saw that imagery and activeness alone do not indi-
cate the presence of the MRE. An MRE sentence
is not just active; it is separated from the stative in-
troduction by the other events of the story. Nor is
it enough for a sentence to have high imagery; the
MRE is more vividly described than the preceding
events – we see again the importance of change
in our model of narrative. False negatives tend to
have high scores in syntactic complexity and for-
mality. As low formality was one of our stronger
predictors of MRE sentences, we may need to ad-
just these features in future work.
We also hope to refine our automatically-
generated labels in future work. Our self-training
experiment showed that 27% of our automatically-
generated labels were too noisy to use. We also
hope to improve our filters for automatically dis-
carding non-story text. We currently reject texts
shorter than three sentences, based on Prince’s
three-part definition of a story. In spite of this fil-
tering, 7% of our 500 manually-labeled texts were
identified as non-stories by our annotator. Extrap-
olating to our training set, we suspect that over 300
of our training ‘narratives’ are not narratives at all.
Finally, we hope to explore other theories of
narrative analysis that could suggest new ways
to quantify change in narrative. Prince, Polanyi,
and Labov propose a high-level view of personal
narrative: stories are centered around reportable
events that cause a change in state for the author.
This work tested fifteen surface-level features that
reflect this change in state. Are there others? Or
is a deeper semantic understanding of the starting
and ending states of stories required?
7 Conclusion
We have described a new model of narrative
based on Prince (1973), Polanyi (1985), and
Labov (1997). Our model tracks story charac-
terstics over the course of a narrative, capturing
change in complexity, meaning, and emotion.
We have created a corpus of 4,896 personal nar-
ratives, taking advantage of AskReddit, a com-
munity where members often prompt each other
for stories. Our experiments on this corpus show
that our change-based model is able to identify
MREs. They also demonstrate that large quanti-
ties of hand-labeled data are not required for this
task. Our distant supervision and self-training
approaches successfully use data weakly labeled
using heuristic rules that leverage the comment
thread structure of Reddit content. We believe
these Reddit stories are representative of the short,
personal narratives found online in blogs or dis-
cussion forums, and so this work should be use-
ful for finding MREs in a variety of online per-
sonal narratives. The one difference between this
data and stories from other online sources is the
prompt. A personal narrative posted to someone’s
personal blog is unlikely to have a prompt. We
use the prompt for our heuristic labeling, so our
automatic labels on non-Reddit data may be nois-
ier, but many blog posts also have titles or tags that
may be just as useful.
Identifying MREs is a hard problem that has not
2156
previously been addressed in work on computa-
tional narrative. We have shown that the high-level
view proposed by linguistic theories of narrative –
that stories are about change – holds true. Mea-
suring change over the course of a narrative yields
better results than other features and baselines.
Why do we care about MREs? Polanyi (1976)
asserts that “one does not produce a narrative text
for no reason at all.” The Most Reportable Event is
that reason. It is the point of the story; the shortest
possible summary; the answer to the question, “So
what?”. It could be used to generate titles or sum-
maries to be used in organizing stories for readers
to browse, or it could be used in recommendation
systems to help readers find related stories. In fu-
ture work we hope to be able to generate a text
description the full MRE, which would be better
suited to summarization or generating headlines,
rather than identifying sentences that refer to it.
We hope this work will encourage others to fur-
ther investigate the Most Reportable Event.
