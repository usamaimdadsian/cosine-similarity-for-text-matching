Abstract
When trained on very large parallel corpora,
the phrase table component of a machine
translation system grows to consume vast
computational resources. In this paper, we in-
troduce a novel pruning criterion that places
phrase table pruning on a sound theoretical
foundation. Systematic experiments on four
language pairs under various data conditions
show that our principled approach is superior
to existing ad hoc pruning methods.
1 Introduction
Over the last years, statistical machine translation
has become the dominant approach to machine
translation. This is not only due to improved mod-
eling, but also due to a significant increase in the
availability of monolingual and bilingual data. Here
are just two examples of very large data resources
that are publicly available:
• The Google Web 1T 5-gram corpus available
from the Linguistic Data Consortium consist-
ing of the 5-gram counts of about one trillion
words of web data.1
• The 109-French-English bilingual corpus with
about one billion tokens from the Workshop on
Statistical Machine Translation (WMT).2
These enormous data sets yield translation models
that are expensive to store and process. Even with

modern computers, these large models lead to a long
experiment cycle that hinders progress. The situa-
tion is even more severe if computational resources
are limited, for instance when translating on hand-
held devices. Then, reducing the model size is of
the utmost importance.
The most resource-intensive components of a sta-
tistical machine translation system are the language
model and the phrase table. Recently, compact rep-
resentations of the language model have attracted
the attention of the research community, for instance
in Talbot and Osborne (2007), Brants et al. (2007),
Pauls and Klein (2011) or Heafield (2011), to name
a few. In this paper, we address the other problem
of any statistical machine translation system: large
phrase tables.
Johnson et al. (2007) has shown that large por-
tions of the phrase table can be removed without loss
in translation quality. This motivated us to perform
a systematic comparison of different pruning meth-
ods. However, we found that many existing methods
employ ad-hoc heuristics without theoretical foun-
dation.
The pruning criterion introduced in this work is
inspired by the very successful and still state-of-the-
art language model pruning criterion based on en-
tropy measures (Stolcke, 1998). We motivate its
derivation by stating the desiderata for a good phrase
table pruning criterion:
• Soundness: The criterion should optimize
some well-understood information-theoretic
measure of translation model quality.
972
• Efficiency: Pruning should be fast, i. e., run lin-
early in the size of the phrase table.
• Self-containedness: As a practical considera-
tion, we want to prune phrases from an existing
phrase table. This means pruning should use
only information contained in the model itself.
• Good empirical behavior: We would like to
be able to prune large parts of the phrase table
without significant loss in translation quality.
Analyzing existing pruning techniques based on
these objectives, we found that they are commonly
deficient in at least one of them. We thus designed
a novel pruning criterion that not only meets these
objectives, it also performs very well in empirical
evaluations.
The novel contributions of this paper are:
1. a systematic description of existing phrase table
pruning methods.
2. a new, theoretically sound phrase table pruning
criterion.
3. an experimental comparison of several pruning
methods for several language pairs.
2 Related Work
The most basic pruning methods rely on probabil-
ity and count cutoffs. We will cover the techniques
that are implemented in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et
al., 2007) and the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004) in
Section 3. We are not aware of any work that ana-
lyzes their efficacy in a systematic way. It is thus not
surprising that some of them perform poorly, as our
experimental results will show.
The work of Johnson et al. (2007) is promis-
ing as it shows that large parts of the phrase ta-
ble can be removed without affecting translation
quality. Their pruning criterion relies on statisti-
cal significance tests. However, it is unclear how
this significance-based pruning criterion is related to
translation model quality. Furthermore, a compari-
son to other methods is missing. Here we close this
gap and perform a systematic comparison. The same
idea of significance-based pruning was exploited in
(Yang and Zheng, 2009; Tomeh et al., 2009) for hi-
erarchical statistical machine translation.
A different approach to phrase table pruning was
undertaken by Eck et al. (2007a; 2007b). They rely
on usage statistics from translating sample data, so it
is not self-contained. However, it could be combined
with the methods proposed here.
Another approach to phrase table pruning is trian-
gulation (Chen et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009). This
requires additional bilingual corpora, namely from
the source language as well as from the target lan-
guage to a third bridge language. In many situations
this does not exist or would be costly to generate.
Duan et al. (2011), Sanchis-Trilles et al. (2011)
and Tomeh et al. (2011) modify the phrase extrac-
tion methods in order to reduce the phrase table size.
The work in this paper is independent of the way the
phrase extraction is done, so those approaches are
complementary to our work.
3 Pruning Using Simple Statistics
In this section, we will review existing pruning
methods based on simple phrase table statistics.
There are two common classes of these methods: ab-
solute phrase table pruning and relative phrase table
pruning.
3.1 Absolute pruning
Absolute pruning methods rely only on the statistics
of a single phrase pair (f˜ , e˜). Hence, they are in-
dependent of other phrases in the phrase table. As
opposed to relative pruning methods (Section 3.2),
they may prune all translations of a source phrase.
Their application is easy and efficient.
• Count-based pruning. This method prunes
a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜) if its observation count
N(f˜ , e˜) is below a threshold ?c:
N(f˜ , e˜) < ?c (1)
• Probability-based pruning. This method
prunes a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜) if its probability is
below a threshold ?p:
p(e˜|f˜) < ?p (2)
Here the probability p(e˜|f˜) is estimated via rel-
ative frequencies.
973
3.2 Relative pruning
A potential problem with the absolute pruning meth-
ods is that it can prune all occurrences of a source
phrase f˜ .3 Relative pruning methods avoid this by
considering the full set of target phrases for a spe-
cific source phrase f˜ .
• Threshold pruning. This method discards
those phrases that are far worse than the best
target phrase for a given source phrase f˜ . Given
a pruning threshold ?t, a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜) is
discarded if:
p(e˜|f˜) < ?t ·max
e˜
{
p(e˜|f˜)
}
(3)
• Histogram pruning. An alternative to thresh-
old pruning is histogram pruning. For each
source phrase f˜ , this method preserves the K
target phrases with highest probability p(e˜|f˜)
or, equivalently, their count N(f˜ , e˜).
Note that, except for count-based pruning, none of
the methods take the frequency of the source phrase
into account. As we will confirm in the empirical
evaluation, this will likely cause drops in translation
quality, since frequent source phrases are more use-
ful than the infrequent ones.
4 Significance Pruning
In this section, we briefly review significance prun-
ing following Johnson et al. (2007). The idea of sig-
nificance pruning is to test whether a source phrase
f˜ and a target phrase e˜ co-occur more frequently in
a bilingual corpus than they should just by chance.
Using some simple statistics derived from the bilin-
gual corpus, namely
• N(f˜) the count of the source phrase f˜
• N(e˜) the count of the target phrase e˜
• N(f˜ , e˜) the co-occurence count of the source
phrase f˜ and the target phrase e˜
• N the number of sentences in the bilingual cor-
pus
3Note that it has never been systematically investigated
whether this is a real problem or just speculation.
we can compute the two-by-two contingency table
in Table 1.
Following Fisher’s exact test, we can calculate the
probability of the contingency table via the hyperge-
ometric distribution:
ph(N(f˜ , e˜)) =
(
N(f˜)
N(f˜ ,e˜)
)
·
(
N?N(f˜)
N(e˜)?N(f˜ ,e˜)
)
(
N
N(e˜)
) (4)
The p-value is then calculated as the sum of all
probabilities that are at least as extreme. The lower
the p-value, the less likely this phrase pair occurred
with the observed frequency by chance; we thus
prune a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜) if:
?
?
??
k=N(f˜ ,e˜)
ph(k)
?
? > ?F (5)
for some pruning threshold ?F . More details of this
approach can be found in Johnson et al. (2007). The
idea of using Fisher’s exact test was first explored by
Moore (2004) in the context of word alignment.
5 Entropy-based Pruning
In this section, we will derive a novel entropy-based
pruning criterion.
5.1 Motivational Example
In general, pruning the phrase table can be consid-
ered as selecting a subset of the original phrase table.
When doing so, we would like to alter the original
translation model distribution as little as possible.
This is a key difference to previous approaches: Our
goal is to remove redundant phrases, whereas previ-
ous approaches usually try to remove low-quality or
unreliable phrases. We believe this to be an advan-
tage of our method as it is certainly easier to measure
the redundancy of phrases than it is to estimate their
quality.
In Table 2, we show some example phrases
from the learned French-English WMT phrase table,
along with their counts and probabilities. For the
French phrase le gouvernement franc¸ais, we have,
among others, two translations: the French govern-
ment and the government of France. If we have
to prune one of those translations, we can ask our-
selves: how would the translation cost change if the
974
N(f˜ , e˜) N(f˜)?N(f˜ , e˜) N(f˜)
N(e˜)?N(f˜ , e˜) N ?N(f˜)?N(e˜) +N(f˜ , e˜) N ?N(f˜)
N(e˜) N ?N(e˜) N
Table 1: Two-by-two contingency table for a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜).

the government of France 11 0.0128
Table 2: Example phrases from the French-English phrase table (K=thousands, M=millions).
same translation were generated from the remain-
ing, shorter, phrases? Removing the phrase the gov-
ernment of France would increase this cost dramat-
ically. Given the shorter phrases from the table, the
probability would be 0.7189 · 0.4106 · 0.0046 =
0.0014?, which is about an order of a magnitude
smaller than the original probability of 0.0128.
On the other hand, composing the phrase the
French government out of shorter phrases has prob-
ability 0.7189 · 0.4106 · 0.6440 = 0.1901, which is
very close to the original probability of 0.1686. This
means it is safe to discard the phrase the French gov-
ernment, since the translation cost remains essen-
tially unchanged. By contrast, discarding the phrase
the government of France does not have this effect:
it leads to a large change in translation cost.
Note that here the pruning criterion only considers
redundancy of the phrases, not the quality. Thus, we
are not saying that the government of France is a
better translation than the French government, only
that it is less redundant.
?We use the assumption that we can simply multiply the
probabilities of the shorter phrases.
5.2 Entropy Criterion
Now, we are going to formalize the notion of re-
dundancy. We would like the pruned model p?(e˜|f˜)
to be as similar as possible to the original model
p(e˜|f˜). We use conditional Kullback-Leibler di-
vergence, also called conditional relative entropy
(Cover and Thomas, 2006), to measure the model
similarity:
D(p(e˜|f˜)||p?(e˜|f˜))
=
?
f˜
p(f˜)
?
e˜
p(e˜|f˜) log
[
p(e˜|f˜)
p?(e˜|f˜)
]
(6)
=
?
f˜ ,e˜
p(e˜, f˜)
[
log p(e˜|f˜)? log p?(e˜|f˜)
]
(7)
Computing the best pruned model of a given size
would require optimizing over all subsets with that
size. Since that is computationally infeasible, we in-
stead apply the equivalent approximation that Stol-
cke (1998) uses for language modeling. This as-
sumes that phrase pairs affect the relative entropy
roughly independently.
We can then choose a pruning threshold ?E and
prune those phrase pairs with a contribution to the
relative entropy below that threshold. Thus, we
975
prune a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜), if
p(e˜, f˜)
[
log p(e˜|f˜)? log p?(e˜|f˜)
]
< ?E (8)
We now address how to assign the probability
p?(e˜|f˜) under the pruned model. A phrase-based
system selects among different segmentations of the
source language sentence into phrases. If a segmen-
tation into longer phrases does not exist, the system
has to compose a translation out of shorter phrases.
Thus, if a phrase pair (f˜ , e˜) is no longer available,
the decoder has to use shorter phrases to produce
the same translation. We can therefore decompose
the pruned model score p?(e˜|f˜) by summing over all
segmentations sK1 and all reorderings pi
K
1 :
p?(e˜|f˜) =
?
sK1 ,pi
K
1
p(sK1 , pi
K
1 |f˜) · p(e˜|s
K
1 , pi
K
1 , f˜) (9)
Here the segmentation sK1 divides both the source
and target phrases into K sub-phrases:
f˜ = f¯pi1 ...f¯piK and e˜ = e¯1...e¯K (10)
The permutation piK1 describes the alignment of
those sub-phrases, such that the sub-phrase e¯k is
aligned to f¯pik . Using the normal phrase translation
model, we obtain:
p?(e˜|f˜) =
?
sK1 ,pi
K
1
p(sK1 , pi
K
1 |f˜)
K?
k=1
p(e¯k|f¯pik) (11)
Virtually all phrase-based decoders use the so-
called maximum-approximation, i. e. the sum is re-
placed with the maximum. As we would like the
pruning criterion to be similar to the search criterion
used during decoding, we do the same and obtain:
p?(e˜|f˜) ? max
sK1 ,pi
K
1
K?
k=1
p(e¯k|f¯pik) (12)
Note that we also drop the segmentation probabil-
ity, as this is not used at decoding time. This leaves
the pruning criterion a function only of the model
p(e˜|f˜) as stored in the phrase table. There is no need
for a special development or adaptation set. We can
determine the best segmentation using dynamic pro-
gramming, similar to decoding with a phrase-based
model. However, here the target side is constrained
to the given phrase e˜.
It can happen that a phrase is not compositional,
i. e., we cannot find a segmentation into shorter
phrases. In these cases, we assign a small, constant
probability:
p?(e˜|f˜) = pc (13)
We found that the value pc = e?10 works well for
many language pairs.
5.3 Computation
In our experiments, it was more efficient to vary the
pruning threshold ?E without having to re-compute
the entire phrase table. Therefore, we computed the
entropy criterion in Equation (8) once for the whole
phrase table. This introduces an approximation for
the pruned model score p?(e˜|f˜). It might happen
that we prune short phrases that were used as part
of the best segmentation of longer phrases. As these
shorter phrases should not be available, the pruned
model score might be inaccurate. Although we be-
lieve this effect is minor, we leave a detailed experi-
mental analysis for future work.
One way to avoid this approximation would be
to perform entropy pruning with increasing phrase
length. Starting with one-word phrases, which are
trivially non-compositional, the entropy criterion
would be straightforward to compute. Proceed-
ing to two-word phrases, one would decompose the
phrases into sub-phrases by looking up the proba-
bilities of some of the unpruned one-word phrases.
Once the set of unpruned two-word phrases was ob-
tained, one would continue with three-word phrases,
etc.
6 Experimental Evaluation
6.1 Data Sets
In this section, we describe the data sets used for the
experiments. We perform experiments on the pub-
licly available WMT shared translation task for the
following four language pairs:
• German-English
• Czech-English
• Spanish-English
976
Number of Words
Language Pair Foreign English
German - English 42 M 45 M
Czech - English 56 M 65 M
Spanish - English 232 M 210 M
French - English 962 M 827 M
Table 3: Training data statistics. Number of words in the
training data (M=millions).
• French-English
For each pair, we train two separate system, one for
each direction. Thus it can happen that a phrase is
pruned for X-to-Y, but not for Y-to-X.
These four language pairs represent a nice range
of training corpora sizes, as shown in Table 3.
6.2 Baseline System
Pruning experiments were performed on top of the
following baseline system. We used a phrase-
based statistical machine translation system similar
to (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and
Ney, 2004; Zens and Ney, 2008). We trained a 4-
gram language model on the target side of the bilin-
gual corpora and a second 4-gram language model
on the provided monolingual news data. All lan-
guage models used Kneser-Ney smoothing.
The baseline system uses the common phrase
translation models, such as p(e˜|f˜) and p(f˜ |e˜), lex-
ical models, word and phrase penalty, distortion
penalty as well as a lexicalized reordering model
(Zens and Ney, 2006).
The word alignment was trained with six itera-
tions of IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1993) and 6 it-
erations of the HMM alignment model (Vogel et al.,
1996) using a symmetric lexicon (Zens et al., 2004).
The feature weights were tuned on a development
set by applying minimum error rate training (MERT)
under the Bleu criterion (Och, 2003; Macherey et al.,
2008). We ran MERT once with the full phrase table
and then kept the feature weights fixed, i. e., we did
not rerun MERT after pruning to avoid adding un-
necessary noise. We extract phrases up to a length
of six words. The baseline system already includes
phrase table pruning by removing singletons and
keeping up to 30 target language phrases per source
phrase. We found that this does not affect transla-

are done on top of this.
6.3 Results
In this section, we present the experimental results.
Translation results are reported on the WMT’07
news commentary blind set.
We will show translation quality measured with
the Bleu score (Papineni et al., 2002) as a function
of the phrase table size (number of phrases). Being
in the upper left corner of these figures is desirable.
First, we show a comparison of several
probability-based pruning methods in Figure 1.
We compare
• Prob. Absolute pruning based on Eq. (2).
• Thres. Threshold pruning based on Eq. (3).
• Hist. Histogram pruning as described in Sec-
tion 3.2.5
We observe that these three methods perform
equally well. There is no difference between abso-
lute and relative pruning methods, except that the
two relative methods (Thres and Hist) are limited by
4The Bleu score drops are as follows: English-French 0.3%,
French-English 0.4%, Czech-English 0.3%, all other are less
than 0.1%.
5Instead of using p(e˜|f˜) one could use the weighted model
score including p(f˜ |e˜), lexical weightings etc.; however, we
found that this does not give significantly different results; but
it does introduce a undesirable dependance between feature
weights and phrase table pruning.
977
the number of source phrases. Thus, they reach a
point where they cannot prune the phrase table any
further. The results shown are for German-English;
the results for the other languages are very similar.
The results that follow use only the absolute prun-
ing method as a representative for probability-based
pruning.
In Figures 2 through 5, we show the transla-
tion quality as a function of the phrase table size.
We vary the pruning thresholds to obtain different
phrase table sizes. We compare four pruning meth-
ods:
• Count. Pruning based on the frequency of a
phrase pair, c.f. Equation (1).
• Prob. Pruning based on the absolute probabil-
ity of a phrase pair, c.f. Equation (2).
• Fisher. Pruning using significance tests, c.f.
Equation (5).
• Entropy. Pruning using the novel entropy cri-
terion, c.f. Equation (8).
Note that the x-axis of these figures is on a logarith-
mic scale, so the differences between the methods
can be quite dramatic. For instance, entropy pruning
requires less than a quarter of the number of phrases
needed by count- or significance-based pruning to
achieve a Spanish-English Bleu score of 34 (0.4 mil-
lion phrases compared to 1.7 million phrases).
These results clearly show how the pruning meth-
ods compare:
1. Probability-based pruning performs poorly. It
should be used only to prune small fractions of
the phrase table.
2. Count-based pruning and significance-based
pruning perform equally well. They are much
better than probability-based pruning.
3. Entropy pruning consistently outperforms the
other methods across translation directions and
language pairs.
Figures 6 and 7 show compositionality statistics
for the pruned Spanish-English phrase table (we ob-
served similar results for the other language pairs).
Total number of phrases 4 137 M
Compositional 3 970 M
Non-compositional 167 M
of those: one-word phrases 85 M
no segmentation 82 M
Table 4: Statistics of phrase compositionality
(M=millions).
Each figure shows the composition of the phrase ta-
ble for a type of pruning for different phrase tables
sizes. Along the x-axis, we plotted the phrase ta-
ble size. These are the same phrase tables used to
obtain the Bleu scores in Figure 2 (left). The dif-
ferent shades of grey correspond to different phrase
lengths. For instance, in case of the smallest phrase
table for count-based pruning, the 1-word phrases
account for about 30% of all phrases, the 2-word
phrases account for about 35% of all phrases, etc.
With the exception of the probability-based prun-
ing, the plots look comparable. The more aggres-
sive the pruning, the larger the percentage of short
phrases. We observe that entropy-based pruning re-
moves many more long phrases than any of the other
methods. The plot for probability-based pruning is
different in that the percentage of long phrases ac-
tually increases with more aggressive pruning (i. e.
smaller phrase tables). A possible explanation is
that probability-based pruning does not take the fre-
quency of the source phrase into account. This
difference might explain the poor performance of
probability-based pruning.
To analyze how many phrases are compositional,
we collect statistics during the computation of the
entropy criterion. These are shown in Table 4, ac-
cumulated across all language pairs and all phrases,
i. e., including singleton phrases. We see that 96%
of all phrases are compositional (3 970 million out
of 4 137 million phrases). Furthermore, out of
the 167 million non-compositional phrases, more
than half (85 million phrases), are trivially non-
compositional: they consist only of a single source
or target language word. The number of non-trivial
non-compositional phrases is, with 82 million or 2%
of the total number of phrases, very small.
In Figure 8, we show the effect of the constant

pc for non-compositional phrases.6 The results
shown are for Spanish-English; additional experi-
ments for the other languages and translation direc-
tions showed very similar results. Overall, there is
no big difference between the values. Hence, we
chose a value of 10 for all experiments.
The results in Figure 2 to Figure 5 show that
entropy-based pruning clearly outperforms the al-
ternative pruning methods. However, it is a bit
hard to see from the graphs exactly how much ad-
ditional savings it offers over other methods. In Ta-
ble 5, we show how much of the phrase table we
have to retain under various pruning criteria with-

quality. We see that probability-based pruning al-
lows only for marginal savings. Count-based and
significance-based pruning results in larger savings
between 70% and 90%, albeit with fairly high vari-

ability. Entropy-based pruning achieves consistently
high savings between 85% and 95% of the phrase ta-
ble. It always outperforms the other pruning meth-
ods and yields significant savings on top of count-
based or significance-based pruning methods. Of-
ten, we can cut the required phrase table size in half
compared to count or significance based pruning.
As a last experiment, we want to confirm that
phrase-table pruning methods are actually better
than simply reducing the maximum phrase length.
In Figure 9, we show a comparison of different
pruning methods and a length-based approach for
Spanish-English. For the ’Length’ curve, we first
drop all 6-word phrases, then all 5-word phrases, etc.
until we are left with only single-word phrases; the
phrase length is measured as the number of source
language words. We observe that entropy-based,
count-based and significance-based pruning indeed
outperform the length-based approach. We obtained
similar results for the other languages.

7 Conclusions
Phrase table pruning is often addressed in an ad-hoc
way using the heuristics described in Section 3. We
have shown that some of those do not work well.
Choosing the wrong technique can result in sig-
nificant drops in translation quality without saving
much in terms of phrase table size. We introduced
a novel entropy-based criterion and put phrase ta-
ble pruning on a sound theoretical foundation. Fur-
thermore, we performed a systematic experimental
comparison of existing methods and the new entropy
criterion. The experiments were carried out for four
language pairs under small, medium and large data
conditions. We can summarize our conclusions as
follows:
• Probability-based pruning performs poorly
when pruning large parts of the phrase table.
This might be because it does not take the fre-
quency of the source phrase into account.
• Count-based pruning performs as well as

significance-based pruning.
• Entropy-based pruning gives significantly
larger savings in phrase table size than any
other pruning method.
• Compared to previous work, the novel entropy-
based pruning often achieves the same Bleu
score with only half the number of phrases.
8 Future Work
Currently, we take only the model p(e˜|f˜) into ac-
count when looking for the best segmentation. We
might obtain a better estimate by also consider-
ing the distortion costs, which penalize reordering.
We could also include other phrase models such as
p(f˜ |e˜) and the language model.
The entropy pruning criterion could be applied
to hierarchical machine translation systems (Chiang,
2007). Here, we might observe even larger reduc-
tions in phrase table size as there are many more en-
tries.
