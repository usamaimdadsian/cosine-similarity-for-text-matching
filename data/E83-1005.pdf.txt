ABSTRACT 
A computer program for the automatic translation of any 
text of Italian into naturally fluent synthetic speech is pre- 
sented. The program, or Phonological Processor (hence FP) maps 
into prosodic structures the phonological rules of Italian. 
Structural information is provided by such hierarchical pros- 
odic constituents as Syllable (S), Metrical Foot (HF), Phono- 
logical Word (PW), Intonational Group (IG). Onto these struc- 
tures, phonological rules are applied such as the " letter-to-  
sound" rules, automatic word stress rules,internal stress hier- 
archy rules indicating secondary stress,external sandhi rules, 
phonological focus assignment rules, logical focus assignment 
rules. The FP constitutes also a model to simulate the reading 
process aloud, and the psycholinguistics and cognitive aspects 
related wil l  be discussed in the computational model of the FP. 
At present, Logical Focus assignment rules and the computation- 
al model are work in progress s t i l l  to be implemented in the 
FP. Recorded samples of automatically produced synthetic 
speech will  be presented at the conference to i11ustrate the 
functioning of the rules. 
O. Introduction 
The FP which we shall describe in detail in the following 
pages, is the terminal section of a system of speech synthesis 
by rule without vocabulary restrictions, implemented at the 
Centre of Computational Sonology of the University of Padua. 
From the linguistic point of view the FP is a model to simu- 
late the operations carried out by an Italian speaker when 
reading aloud any text. To this end, the speaker shall use the 
rules of his internal grammar to translate graphic signs into 
natural speech. These rules wi11 have to be implemented in the 
FP, together with a computational mechanism simulating the 
psychological end cognitive functions of the reading process. 
I. The Phonologlcal Rules 
At the phonological level the FP has to account for low 
level or segmental phenomena, and high level or suprasegmental 
ones. The former are represented by three levels of structure, 
that is S, MF, PW and are governed by phonological rules which 
are meant to render the movements of the vocal tract and the 
coarticulatory effects which occur regularly at word level and 
at word boundaries. The latter are represented by one level of 
structure, the IG, and are governed by rules which account for 
long range phenomena like pitch contour formation, intonation 
centre assignment, pauses. In brief, the rules that the FP 
shall have to apply are the following: 
i .  transcription from grapheme to nphoneme", including the 
most regular coarticulatory and allophonic phenomena of the 
It~dian language; 
ii. automatic word stress assignment, including all the most 
frequent exceptions to the rules as well as individuation 
of homographs, which are very common in Italian; 
i i i .  internal word stress hierarchy, with secondary stres/es 
assignment, individuation of unstressed dipththongs, triph- 
thongs, hiatuses; 
iv. external sandhi rules, operating at word boundaries and re- 
sulting in stress retraction, destressing, stress hierarchy 
modification, elision by assimilation and other phenomena; 
v. destressing of functional words listed in a table lookup; 
vi. pauses marked off by punctuation; pauses deriving from a 
count of PWs; pauses deriving from syntactic structural 
phenomena; comma intonation marking of parentheticals and 
similar structures; 
v i i .  rules to restructure the IG when too long - more than ? 
PWs, or too short - less than 5 PWs; 
v i i i .  Focus Assignment Rules or FAR, which at f i rs t  mark Phono- 
logical Focus, or intonation centre dependent on lexical 
and phonologically determined phenomena; 
ix. FAR which mark Logical Focus or intonation centre depend- 
ent on structurally determined phenomena. 
From a general computational point of view,the FP operates bot- 
tom-up to apply low level rules, analysing each word at a time 
until the PW structure is reached; i t  operates top-down to ap- 
ply high level rules and to build the higher structure, the IG. 
2. The Phonematic Transcription 
As far as phonematic transcription of Italian texts is 
concerned, there seems to be no such di f f icult ies as for En- 
glish. In fact "letter-to-sound" rules are only a few and 
quite straightforward to be described. There are a number of 
exceptions and counterexceptions to the rules which have to be 
specified, but no dictionary lookup seems to be needed. What 
creates the main di f f icult ies are digraphs and trigrapbs which 
are ambiguous in that they can render both stops and palatals; 
some of the decisions concerning trigraphs must be taken after 
stress has been assigned by word stress rules. The following 
graphemes have been transcribed into symbols denoting "phonet- 
ic elements": 
K = CH, C+A,+O,+U KK = CCH, CC+A,+Os+U - -~ /k /  
% = CI, rE, CI.Vowel %% = CCI, CCE, COl+Vowel ---> It~l 
J = GI, GE, GI÷Vowel JJ = GGI, GGE, GGI+Vowel ---> /03/ 
/ = SCI,SCE,SCI+Vowel ---> /S/ 
< = GLI,GLE,GLI+Vowel ---> /~/ 
> = GN+Vowel ---> /3~/ 
X = Voiced S XX = Geminate S ---> /z/ 
& = Voiced Z && = Geminate Z ---> /dz/ 
26 
And here are some exceptions: 
GLICINE, ANGLIA, GEROGLIFICO where GL = /gl/  not //./ 
FARMACIA, LUCIA where Cl : I t I i l  not It~l 
BUGIA, AEROFAGIA, NOSTALGIA whore GI = /d~i/ not /d3/ 
SCIA where SCI = /$i/ not /S/ 
Here below we include the flowchart of the phonological rules 
for the transcription of graphemes S and Z which, as we said, 
have both voiced/unvoiced phonemes. As i t  can be easily seen, 
the two graphemes have been treated together by the same set 
of rule operating conjunctively: thus a remarkable economy and 
simplicity has resulted; as to the theoretical import of using 
one and thesame algorithm, i t  has been shown that voiced S/Z 
decisions obey to similar underlying phonological rules. 
3. Word Stress Rules 
It is our opinion 'that Italian speakers do not use directly 
morpho-syntactic information to assign word stress, but an 
ordered set of phonological rules to lexical items completely 
specified in a lexicon, together with some morphological 
information - relatively only to a subclass of word types; 
syntactic category information is limited to the verb class. 
In other words, Italian is not a free-stress language, as 
diffusedIy discussed in Delmonte (1981). Speakers analyse 
fu l ly  specifies lexical items by blocks of word stress rules 
ordered sequentially, which address dif ferent types of words 
according to syllable structure. Words are made to enter each 
rule block disjunctively, that is each word either enters a 
block and receives stress, or is passed on to the next block. 
Exceptions are processed f i r s t .  No word can be sent back to 
• ~S 
steps of the algorithm already passed, that is there.no 
backtracking. The FP divides al l  words into two main classes: 
lexical words or open class words, and functional words or 
closed class words, the latter  ones are dealt with by a table 
lookup and destressed. Lexical words are made to enter into 
blocks of rules according to the following criteria: 
i .  verbs are labelled f i r s t  by means of a table lookup made up 
of 1500 most frequent Ital ian verbs extracted from the LIF; 
i io BLOCK I deals with words with graphic stress on the last 
syllable as "carit~", with truncated words - Italian words 
with consonant ending and foreign words; with monosyllabic 
words which can receive word stress l ike nso" a verb, or 
be treated as functional words l ike "1o n, an art ic le;  
i i i .  BLOCK I I  deals with bisyl labic words and applies to a l l  
words the f i r s t  general word stress rule which states that 
i f  a word has an heavy syllable in penultimate position i t  
receives stress on that syllable;

ending with -ERVowe1#, in which stress may result on the 
penultimate syllable i f  exception, and on the antepenult i f

ending with a sy l lable containing more than one vowel, or 
with more than one vowel in penultimate syl lable - biphone- 
matic, trtphonematic or ~etraphonematic vowel groups may re- 
sult  in diphthong, tr iphthong, or hiatuses l ike  "bugia", 
• acciaio n, "a iuo le" .  
Word stress rules l ike  Rule I take into account a series of 
phonotactic conditions as well as the syntactic category of 
verb which is essential  to the treatment of homographs and to 
word stress assignment. In fact ,  I ta l ian  is a language very 
rich in homographs such as "'ambito - am'bito n, " 'apr i le  - 
a 'p r i le "  and so on. Usually, by varying the posit ion of stress 
also the syntactic category w i l l  vary. Such words are includ- 
ed in a table lookup and syntactic category is decided accord- 
ing to contextual information. Another class of homographs, be- 
longing this time to the one and same syntactic category, is 
made up by such words as " r i ' cordat i  - r i cor 'dat i  n, " im'piccia- 
t i  - imp i ' cc ia t i " ,  which are treated also according to context-

ual information and to the posit ion they occupy in the ut ter -  
ance. I f  they come in f i r s t  posit ion or af ter  a pause, i t  is 
assumed that they are c l i t i c i zed  imperatives and stress is as- 
signed to the antepenultimate sy l lab le ;  i f  they do not have 
that posit ion in the utterance and an unstressed word precedes 
them,they are treated as past part ic ip les  and stress is assign. 
ed to the penultimate sy l lable (See Fig.2).  
4. Internal Word Stress Hierarchy 
These rules take mainly decisions about secondary stress as- 
signment and also about an adequate def in i t ion  of a l l  unstress. 
ed syl lables preceding and fol lowing the stressed one. To as- 
sign secondary stress the FP builds up the MP structure.  This 
is done by counting the number of syl lables preceding the 
stressed one. The rule states that the FP has to alternate one 
unstressed syl lable before each primary or secondary stressed

one. Restructuring may result in words with three or more than 
three syllables before the primary stressed one, as in: 
" f~ l i c i ' ta"  "aut~ntic i ' ta" "a r t i f i c ia l i ' ta"  "fot6gra'fare" 
"ctnem~to'grafico" matem~tica'mente" "rappres~ntativa'mente" 
"ut i l l tar\]st ica'mente" "preclpitevollssimevol'mente" 
According to the number of syllables, two unstressed syllables 
may precede or follow the secondary stressed one. The Restruct- 
uring Rule for the. MF takes into account performance facts 
which require that the number of secondary stressed syllables 
cannot be more than two when speaking at normal rate, but also 
that no more than three unstressed syllables may alternate 
stressed ones. To produce particular emphasis, i .e .  i f  the 
word constitutes in i t se l f  an utterance, there may be obvious- 
ly an increase to three secondary stresses in the same word or 
even to four as in "precipit~vol\]ssim~vol'mente'. This fact 
wi l l  slow down the speaking rate at values - number of syl la- 
bles per second - which is under the norm, only to suit the 
speaker's aim to produce emphasis. 
5. External Sandhi Rules 
Up to this point, low level rules have built PW by stress 
ing some words and destressing some other words which have 
become proclitics and are joined to the f i rst  stressed word on 
their right to build a PW as in "della nostra parte" (on our 
side). High level rules localize punctuation pauses and start 
to apply external sandhi rules, which may elide a vowel, as in 
"la famigli~ ~gnelli", " i i  mar~ ~ molto agitato" (RULE I I ) ;  or 
they may produce schwa-like vowels as in "hann~nteresse", ~ 
incredibile" (RULE I I I ) ;  retract primary stress as in "'dottor 
m 
'Romolo", "'ingegner 'Rossi" (RULE IVa/b). In the latter case, 
stress rules have to move back primary stress and to unstress 
the remaining syllables. It is essential to apply these rules 
in this phase, because intonation centre may only be assigned 
to primary stressed syllables: exceptions are represented 
either by auxillaries which can assume the role of lexical 
verbs as in "oggi non ci sono" (today I'm not there), nho chie° 
sto ma non ce l'hanno" (I asked but they haven't got i t ) ;  or 
by cl it ics and adjectives which can become pronouns as in "non 
ci vengo con re" (I don't come with you), "preferisco quella" 
(I prefer that one).

6. IG Construal Rules 
At this point the FP shall have to be provided of rules which 
transform one or more PWs joining them into an IG as well as 
of rules which assign the intonation centre of the utterance. 
The two operations are dependent on Rule of IG construal and 
on Focus Assignment Rules or FAR. IG Construal Rules should 
intu i t ive ly  build well formed IGs. General well-formedness con- 
ditions could be established so that phonological facts reflec- 
ting performance l imitations as well as syntactic and semantic 
phenomena can be adequately taken into account. These condi- 
tions are as follows: 
CONDITIONS A. determined by intr ins ic  characteristics of the 
functioning of memory and of the articulatory apparatus which 
impose restrictions on the length of an IG - length is defined 
in terms of the number of constituents, i .e. PWs, to be packed 
into an IG; this number could vary with the speaking rate and 
other performance parameters which are str ict ly related to 
temporal and spatial limitations of the language faculty; 
CONOITIONS B. determined by the need to transmit into an IG 
chunks of conceptual and semantic information concluded in i t -  
self and related to the rules of the internal grammar. 
Construal Rules referring to Conditions A. will f i rst  base 
their application on punctuation, assigning main pauses for 
each comma, fu11-stop, colon, semi-colon detected in the text. 
Restructuring may then take place according to the number of 
constituents present in each IG; i f  less than three, the IG is 
too small to stand on its own, and i t  will be joined to the 
preceding one; i f  more than seven PWs, and the utterance is 
not yet ended, two IGs wi11 result according to phrase struc- 
ture analysed by the grammar component, or provisionally by 
contextual information based on syntactic category labels, and 
on the presence of functional words which are regarded as pro- 
c l i t i cs  and should be joined to the f i r s t  following PW. 
To satisfy Condition B. phonological information is insuff i -  
cient; syntactic and semantic information shall have to be sup- 
plied to the FP. The theoretical proposal which,in our opinion 
will suit best our performance oriented processor is the lexic- 
al functional one, diffusedly discussed in Bresnan (1978,1980, 
1982), Kaplan & Bres.,an (1981), G~;oar (1980, 1982). The lexic- 
al functional component is made up by two subcomponents: 
I. a lexicon, where each entry is completely specified and has 
associated subcategorization features; lexical items subcat- 
egorize for such universal functions as SUBJECT, OBJECT and 
so on, and not for constituent structure categories; lexic- 
al items exert selectional restrictions on a subset of 
their subcategorized functions; the predicate argument 
structure of a lexical item l ists the arguments for which 
there are selectional restrictions. Each lexical item in- 
cludes a lexical form which pe!rs arguments with functions, 
as well as the grammatical function assignment which l ists 
the syntactically ;uFcategorized functions. 
context-free rules to generate syntactlc constituent struc- 
tures. 
The combination of the ~wo descriptions will result in a cons- 
tituent structure and a functional structure which represent 
29 
formally the grammatical relations of the utterance analysed 
in terms of universal functions. Functional relations interven- 
ing between predicate argument structure and adjuncts or comp- 
lements are determined by a theory of control which is an inte- 
gral part of the lexical functional grammar. At this point, we 
can formulate the following 
RULES OF IG CONSTRUAL 
1. Constituents moved .by dislocations, clefting, extraposi- 
ttons, and raising, obligatory form at least one IG (for 
the exceptions see Oelmonte, 1983); 
2. Starting with the f i r s t  PW of an utterance, join into one 
IG al l  PWsuntil you reach: 
2.1 the Verb, in Wh- questions, and imperatives; 
2.2 the last element functionally controlled by a VP, i .e .  an 
argument or a subordinate clause; complements or adjuncts 
functionally controlled by the Subject of the Object; 
2.3 the last element anaphorically controlled by a supraordin- 
ated clause where the matrix Subject appears, control is 
expressed at functional level by thematic restr ict ions. 
In this way, pauses wi l l  be assigned to the most adequate 
sites taking into account both performance and structural res- 
trictions. 
7. Focus Assignment Rules (FAR) 
We can distinguish between two kinds of FAR, marked and unmark- 
ed ones. Unmarked FAR are dependent on phonological and lexic-  
al information and give rise to Phonological Focus; marked FAR 
are dependent on structural information and give rise to Logic- 
al Focus (See Gueron, 1980). 
Phonological information is used to account for utterances 
such as simple declaratives, imperatives, wh- questions, yes/ 
no question, echo questions, where IGs can be bui l t  without 
structural information and the Nuclear Stress Rule can be made 
to apply in a straightforward way. The Nuclear Stress Rule 
(see Chomsky & Halle, 1968), can be reformulated as follows: 
"within an IG reduce to secondary stresses a l l  primary 
stresses except the one farthest to the right n, as in: 
2 ? 2 3 3 1 
(1) Jack studies secondary education. 
which is derived from an underlying representation where word 
stress is assigned by phonological word stress rules, 
1 1 1 2 2 1 
(2) Jack studies secondary education. 
The NSR for English works in the same way for Italian, as in: 
2 3 1 2 2 3 1 
(3) NeIia scuola superiore, Ginrgiu non studia a sufficienza. 
lexical information is required to label verbs, and is passed 
on to the phonological component in order to assign focus to 
wh- questions and imperatives as in: 
F 
(4) Che tipo di libri scrive la persona che hal salutatn ieri? 
F 
(5) Smettila di far tutto quel baccano quando leggo un libro. 
Lexical information is also essential in order to spot logical 
operators which induce emphatic intonation and attract the in- 
tonation centre of the utterance in their scope, usually sh i f t -  
ing i t  to the le f t .  These lexical items are words such as NO, 
MORE, MUCH, ALL, ALSO, ONLY, \[00 etc. (see Jackendoff, 1972), 
which modify the semantic import of the utterance and attract 
the intonation centre to the f i r s t  PW in their scope; or in 
case they modify the whole utterance, they move the focus to 
the following proposition, as in: 
F 
(6) Anche Giorgio racconter~ una bella storia.  
F 
(7) Gli studenti hanno fatto multi esami nella sessione estiva. 
(8) I1 bandito non ha ucciso i l  pol iz iotto,  ma la persona al le 
F 
sue spalle. F 
(8a) I1 bandito non ha ucciso i l  poliziottOo 
A second set of FAR, the marked ones, shall assign Logical 
focus according to structural information. This time the FP 
shall have to be supplied by syntactic and functional in for -  
mation relat ively to those constituents which have been dis- 
placed and have been moved to the le f t .  This information is de- 
rived from the augmentation which is worked on the context-free 
c-structure grammar of the lexical functional component, by 
means of the functional description which serves as an inter-  
mediary between c-structure and the f-structure. Long distance 
phenomena l ike questions, relat ives, c left ing, subject raising 
extrapositions and so on are easily spotted by the use of var i -  
ables which can represent both immediately dominated metavaria- 
bias - specified as subcategorization features in the lexicon- 
and bounded domination metavariables, the nodes to which they 
wi l l  be attached are farther away in the c-structure, and are 
empty in f-structure representation. Focus is assigned to the 
OBJECT argument of the verb as in: 
F 
(g) John has some books to read. 
F 
(10) I have plans for tonight. 
F 
(11) I t  is the cream that I l ike.  
F 
(12) Ann I love. 
Other structures l ike relatives, tough movements, subject ra is -  
ing behave d i f ferent ly  from English: in Ital ian focus may be 
assigned phonologically as in: F 
(13) He visto \[1 vento muovere le foglieo 
F 
(1~) E' faci le per Bruno conquistare Maria. 
F 
(15) Maria ~ faci le per Bruno da conquistare. F 
(16) Elena ha lasciato istruzioni che Giorgio eseguir~o 
(r)  r 
(17) A Maria $ piaciuta la proposta chele  ha lasciato Gino. 
Focus marked (F) is optional and emphatic, but i t  is s t i l l  d i f -  
ferent from focus marking in the corresponding English utter-  
ance (see Stockwell, 1972). 
No provision is made as yet for FAR meant to account for dis- 
course level phenomena, knowledge of the world variables, co- 
textual rather than cQntextual variables, which operate beyond 
and across sentence and utterance boundaries. At this level, 
coreference between two constituents shall have to be determin- 
ed by synonymous items~ and synonymity calls for knowledge of 
the world, text level analysis which is not available in a 
s t r i c t ly  formal system of rules. Examples to this point is the 
following: F F 
(18) \[onight the children have been really nasty, so I scolded 
the bastards. 
30 
where focus is assigned to the verb instead of the NP OBJECT 
f inal  because the latter is epithet of or synonymous with the 
NP OBJECT of the supraordinated proposition. We can thus formu- 
late the following: 
FOCUS ASSIGNMENT RULES 
1. Ouestions 
1.1 in wh- questions focus is assigned to the Verb;adverbials 
and other adjuncts are joined to the Verb and receive 
fOCUS; 
1.1.1 according to the functional roles assumed by the argu- 
ments of the verb, focus can be assigned to the NP ar- 
gument acting as Agent SUBJECT; 
1.1.2 if  extrapositions of PP from NP are in act, or a ques- 
tion word like "perch," is present, focus is assigned 
to the PP; 
1.2 in yes/no question and echo questions, assign Focus phono- 
logically; 
2. Imperatives 
Focus is assigned to the Verb according to predicate argument 
structure; adjuncts are joined to the Verb and receive focus; 
3. Oeclaratives 
3.1 if there are arguments displaced to the left of the 
SUBJECT, focus will be assigned to the last constituent 
farthest to the right by NSR; topicalizations, clefting 
and some kinds of extraposition attract focus to the dis- 
placed argument; 
).2 i f  there are propositional complements, Focus will be as- 
signed again by NSR; 
3.3 parentheticals, appositives, non-restrictive relatives 
will be assigned comma intonation; 
3.4 with multiple embedded structures, focus assignment is 
conditioned by the presence of a lexical SUBJECT non ana- 
phorically controlled by the SUBJECT of a supraordinated 
proposition; i f  so, more IGs wi l l  be bui l t  and more than 
one focus wi l l  result. 
8. The Computational Mechanism 
So far, we have described the rules of which the#P is 
equipped. We shall now deal with the psycholinguistic and 
cognitive aspects of the FP which, as we said at the 
beginning, is a model to simulate the process of reading aloud 
any text. From the previous description, i t  would seem that a 
speaker analyses the utterance proceeding at f i r s t  bottom-up, 
unti l  a l l  low level rules have been applied to the structure 
of PW; subsequently, he skould apply high level rules and he 
should build up IGs operating top-down. 
In fact, the two procedures will have to interact at 
certain points of the utterance so that both low and high 
level rules wi l l  be applied contemporarily and fluent reading 
aloud wi l l  result. Whereas the speaker applies low level 
rules each time the graphic boundary of a word is reached, to 
apply high level rules he wi l l  have to wait for the end of an 
IG, which could be determined phonologically or by lexicel 
functional information. Intuitively, as he proceeds in the 
reading process, the speaker will stress open class words and 
destress closed class ones; he will assign the internal stress 
hierarchy, and at the same time he wi l l  look for the most 
adequate sites to assign main pauses; he wi l l  apply external 
sandhl rules, modifying, i f  required, the previous internal 
stress hierarchy; he wi l l  build up pitch contour according to 
the intonational typology appropriate to the utterance he is 
producing; intonation centre may result shifted to the le f t  i f  
he encounters logical operators, or to the end of the utter- 
ance, provided that i t  is not a complex proposition with embed- 
ded and subordinate structures in i t .  
To carry out such an interchange of rule application 
between the two levels of analysis of the utterance the FP 
shall have to jump from one level to the other i f  need be. I t  
wi l l  then be provided with a window which enables i t  to do a 
look-ahead in order to acquire two kinds of information: the 
one related to the presence of blanks, or graphic boundaries 
between words and the other related to the presence of punc- 
tuation marks. The window we have devised for the FP enables 
i t  to inspect f ive consecutive words, but not to know which of 
these words wi l l  become the head of a PW or a PW i t se l f ,  at 
least not before low level rules wi l l  apply. The function of 
the window is then limited to the individuation of possible 
sites for punctuation pauses. But this is also what a reader 
wi l l  probably do while reading the text: as a matter of fact, 
he wi l l  surely want to know how may graphic words are left  
before the end of the utterance is reached. Graphic informa- 
tion provided by the window is v i ta l  then both for low level 
and high level rules application. 
As far as low level rules are concerned, the local bottom- 
up procedure is well just i f ied since the reader wil l  want to 
know f i r s t  i f  the word eods with a graphic stress mark, assign- 
ing word stress immediately; i f  this is not the case, he wi l l  
turn to the penultimate syllable, which is the site where I ta-  
l ian word stress assignment is decided, and he wi l l  carry out 
syllable count i f  needed. Word stress rule wi l l  apply and in- 
ternal stress hierarchy wi l l  be assigned. 
The main decision to be taken before high level rules may 
start to apply regards pauses. As we said before, visual infor-  
mation may guide the reader together with phonological deci- 
sions previously taken. But quantitative count of words s t i l l  
le f t  to process is only the f i r s t  cr i ter ion,  which shall have 
to be confirmed by qualitative analysis on a structural level. 
Structurally assigned pauses shall have to account for subor- 
dinate, coordinate propositions as well as embedded ones.Where 
as comma intonation wi l l  have to be assigned to appositives, 
parentheticals and non restr ict ive clauses, subordinate propo- 
sit ions may be assigned Focus. Graphic information - the pres- 
ence of one or two commas in the utterance - may thus receive 
two completely dif ferent interpretations: the FP shall have to 
individuate subordinate clauses which are usually preceded by 
adverbials, l inkers or conjuncts such as SE, OUANDO, SEBBENE, 
PERCHE', BENCHE', etc. which cause temporary information stor- 
age and a suspension of RAF application. Focus goes to the sub- 
ordinate only i f  i t  comes at the beginning of the utterance 
and i t  is not a proposition of the kind of concessives, conse- 
cutives, conditionals, adversatives which are easily detected 
from the kind of conjunct introducing them. 
As far as embedded clauses are concerned, waiting for the 
lexical functional component o be activated, the FP operates 
only through the individuation of verbs and of complementizers 
In particular, the presence of "che" may induce a pause only 
i f  the embedded clause is right-branching. Completives, l ike 
in f in i t ives  and indirect questions, as well as restr ict ive 
clauses do not require a pause unless a lexica\] subject is 
present (See Fig. 3)-

9. Acoustic Parameters and Phonetic 0etail 
We said at the beginning that the FP is the terminal sec- 
tion of a system of synthesis by rule; we also said that the 
performance oriented apparatus of phonological rules are meant 
to simulate the movements of the vocal tract of a speaker read- 
ing aloud any Italian text. To bring the FP as close as possi- 
ble to the linguistic realization process we have undertaken 
experimental work in order to detect the characteristics of 
normal intonational and accentual phenomena of the process of 
reading aloud. Ten speakers have repeated ~ times long utter- 
ances like the one showed in Figs. ~a/b. We measured the intan-

sity curve and the F curve by means of a mingograph; durations 
where measured on an oscilloscope by means of a computer pro- 
gram scanning each 8 ms of the sound wave. Acoustic data were 
very consistent, part icular ly the duration and the intensity 
ones so that they were implemented in the speech synthesizer; 
perception tests demonstrated that both in te l l ig ib i l i ty  and 
naturalness were remarkably improved. 
We include in Fig. 5 the phonological structure of the ut- 
terance analysed, which is bui l t  according to the construal 
rules reported in the paper (see also Nespor & Vogel, 1982; 
Selkirk, 1980).
