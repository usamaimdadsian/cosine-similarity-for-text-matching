Abstract 
The graph-based ranking algorithm has been 
recently exploited for multi-document sum-
marization by making only use of the sen-
tence-to-sentence relationships in the 
documents, under the assumption that all the 
sentences are indistinguishable. However, 
given a document set to be summarized, dif-
ferent documents are usually not equally im-
portant, and moreover, different sentences in a 
specific document are usually differently im-
portant. This paper aims to explore document 
impact on summarization performance. We 
propose a document-based graph model to in-
corporate the document-level information and 
the sentence-to-document relationship into the 
graph-based ranking process. Various meth-
ods are employed to evaluate the two factors.  
Experimental results on the DUC2001 and 
DUC2002 datasets demonstrate that the good 
effectiveness of the proposed model. More-
over, the results show the robustness of the 
proposed model. 
1 Introduction 
Multi-document summarization aims to produce a 
summary describing the main topic in a document 
set, without any prior knowledge. Multi-document 
summary can be used to facilitate users to quickly 
understand a document cluster. For example, a 
number of news services (e.g. NewsInEssence1) 
have been developed to group news articles into 
news topics, and then produce a short summary for 
each news topic. Users can easily understand the 
topic they have interest in by taking a look at the 
short summary, without looking into each individ-
ual article within the topic cluster.

Automated multi-document summarization has 
drawn much attention in recent years. In the com-
munities of natural language processing and infor-
mation retrieval, a series of workshops and 
conferences on automatic text summarization (e.g. 
NTCIR, DUC), special topic sessions in ACL, 
COLING, and SIGIR have advanced the summari-
zation techniques and produced a couple of ex-
perimental online systems. 
A particular challenge for multi-document sum-
marization is that a document set might contain 
diverse information, which is either related or un-
related to the main topic, and hence we need effec-
tive summarization methods to analyze the 
information stored in different documents and ex-
tract the globally important information to reflect 
the main topic. In recent years, both unsupervised 
and supervised methods have been proposed to 
analyze the information contained in a document 
set and extract highly salient sentences into the 
summary, based on syntactic or statistical features. 
Most recently, the graph-based models have 
been successfully applied for multi-document 
summarization by making use of the “voting” or 
“recommendations” between sentences in the 
documents (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and 
Tarau, 2005; Wan and Yang, 2006). The model 
first constructs a directed or undirected graph to 
reflect the relationships between the sentences and 
then applies the graph-based ranking algorithm to 
compute the rank scores for the sentences. The 
sentences with large rank scores are chosen into 
the summary.  However, the model makes uniform 
use of the sentences in different documents, i.e. all 
the sentences are ranked without considering the 
document-level information and the sentence-to-
document relationship. Actually, given a document 
set, different documents are not equally important. 
For example, the documents close to the main top-
ics of the document set are usually more important 
than the documents far away from the main topics 
755
of the document set. This document-level informa-
tion is deemed to have great impact on the sen-
tence ranking process. Moreover, the sentences in 
the same document cannot be treated uniformly, 
because some sentences in the document are more 
important than other sentences because of their 
different positions in the document or different 
distances to the document’s centroid. In brief, nei-
ther the document-level information nor the sen-
tence-to-document relationship has been taken into 
account in the previous graph-based model. 
In order to overcome the limitations of the pre-
vious graph-based model, this study proposes the 
document-based graph model to explore document 
impact on the graph-based summarization, by in-
corporating both the document-level information 
and the sentence-to-document relationship in the 
graph-based ranking process. We develop various 
methods to evaluate the document-level informa-
tion and the sentence-to-document relationship. 
Experiments on the DUC2001 and DUC2002 data-
sets have been performed and the results demon-
strate the good effectiveness of the proposed model, 
i.e., the incorporation of document impact can 
much improve the performance of the graph-based 
summarization. Moreover, the proposed model is 
robust with respect to most incorporation schemes. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 
We first introduce the related work in Section 2. 
The basic graph-based summarization model and 
the proposed document-based graph model are de-
scribed in detail in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. 
We show the experiments and results in Section 5 
and finally we conclude this paper in Section 6. 
2 Related Work 
Generally speaking, summarization methods can 
be abstractive summarization or extractive summa-
rization. Extractive summarization is a simple but 
robust method for text summarization and it in-
volves assigning saliency scores to some units (e.g. 
sentences, paragraphs) of the documents and ex-
tracting those with highest scores, while abstrac-
tion summarization usually needs information 
fusion (Barzilay et al., 1999), sentence compres-
sion (Knight and  Marcu, 2002) and reformulation 
(McKeown et al., 1999). In this study, we focus on 
extractive summarization.  
The centroid-based method (Radev et al., 2004) 
is one of the most popular extractive summariza-
tion methods. MEAD2 is an implementation of the 
centroid-based method that scores sentences based 
on sentence-level and inter-sentence features, in-
cluding cluster centroids, position, TFIDF, etc. 
NeATS (Lin and Hovy, 2002) is a project on multi-
document summarization at ISI based on the sin-
gle-document summarizer-SUMMARIST. Sen-
tence position, term frequency, topic signature and 
term clustering are used to select important content. 
MMR (Goldstein et al., 1999) is used to remove 
redundancy and stigma word filters and time 
stamps are used to improve cohesion and coher-
ence. To further explore user interface issues, 
iNeATS (Leuski et al., 2003) is developed based 
on NeATS. XDoX (Hardy et al., 1998) is a cross 
document summarizer designed specifically to 
summarize large document sets. It identifies the 
most salient themes within the set by passage clus-
tering and then composes an extraction summary, 
which reflects these main themes. Much other 
work also explores to find topic themes in the 
documents for summarization, e.g. Harabagiu and 
Lacatusu (2005) investigate five different topic 
representations and introduce a novel representa-
tion of topics based on topic themes. In addition, 
Marcu (2001) selects important sentences based on 
the discourse structure of the text. TNO’s system 
(Kraaij et al., 2001) scores sentences by combining 
a unigram language model approach with a Bayes-
ian classifier based on surface features. Nenkova 
and Louis (2008) investigate how summary length 
and the characteristics of the input influence the 
summary quality in multi-document summarization.  
Graph-based models have been proposed to rank 
sentences or passages based on the PageRank algo-
rithm (Page et al., 1998) or its variants. Websumm 
(Mani and Bloedorn, 2000) uses a graph-
connectivity model and operates under the assump-
tion that nodes which are connected to many other 
nodes are likely to carry salient information. Lex-
PageRank (Erkan and Radev, 2004) is an approach 
for computing sentence importance based on the 
concept of eigenvector centrality. It constructs a 
sentence connectivity matrix and compute sentence 
importance based on an algorithm similar to Pag-
eRank. Mihalcea and Tarau (2005) also propose a 
similar algorithm based on PageRank to compute 
sentence importance for document summarization. 
Wan and Yang (2006) improve the ranking algo-

rithm by differentiating intra-document links and 
inter-document links between sentences. All these 
methods make use of the relationships between 
sentences and select sentences according to the 
“votes” or “recommendations” from their 
neighboring sentences, which is similar to PageR-
ank. 
Other related work includes topic-focused multi-
document summarization (Daumé. and Marcu, 
2006; Gupta et al., 2007; Wan et al., 2007), which 
aims to produce summary biased to a given topic 
or query. It is noteworthy that our proposed ap-
proach is inspired by (Liu and Ma, 2005), which 
proposes the Conditional Markov Random Walk 
Model based on two-layer web graph in the tasks 
of web page retrieval. 
3 The Basic Graph-Based Model (GM) 
The basic graph-based model is essentially a way 
of deciding the importance of a vertex within a 
graph based on global information recursively 
drawn from the entire graph. The basic idea is that 
of “voting” or “recommendation” between the ver-
tices. A link between two vertices is considered as 
a vote cast from one vertex to the other vertex. The 
score associated with a vertex is determined by the 
votes that are cast for it, and the score of the verti-
ces casting these votes.  
 
Figure 1. One-layer link graph 
Formally, given a document set D, let G=(V, E) be 
an undirected graph to reflect the relationships be-
tween sentences in the document set, as shown in 
Figure 1. V is the set of vertices and each vertex vi 
in V is a sentence in the document set. E is the set 
of edges. Each edge eij in E is associated with an 
affinity weight f(vi, vj) between sentences vi and vj 
(i?j). The weight is computed using the standard 
cosine measure between the two sentences.

where iv
r  and jv
r are the corresponding term vec-
tors of vi and vj.  Here, we have f(vi, vj)=f(vj, vi). 
Two vertices are connected if their affinity weight 
is larger than 0 and we let f(vi, vi)=0 to avoid self 
transition. 
We use an affinity matrix M to describe G with 
each entry corresponding to the weight of an edge 
in the graph. M = (Mi,j)|V|×|V| is defined as follows:

Based on matrix M~ , the saliency score Sen-
Score(vi) for sentence vi can be deduced from those 
of all other sentences linked with it and it can be 
formulated in a recursive form as in the PageRank 
algorithm:

r
is the vector of sen-
tence saliency scores. er  is a vector with all ele-
ments equaling to 1. µ is the damping factor 
usually set to 0.85, as in the PageRank algorithm. 
The above process can be considered as a 
Markov chain by taking the sentences as the states 
and the corresponding transition matrix is given 
by TT ee
|V|
MA rr)1(~ µµ ?+= . The stationary prob-
ability distribution of each state is obtained by the 
principal eigenvector of the transition matrix.  
For implementation, the initial scores of all sen-
tences are set to 1 and the iteration algorithm in 
Equation (4) is adopted to compute the new scores 
of the sentences. Usually the convergence of the 
iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference 
between the scores computed at two successive 
iterations for any sentences falls below a given 
threshold (0.0001 in this study).  
We can see that the basic graph-based model is 
built on the single-layer sentence graph and the 
transition probability between two sentences in the 
Markov chain depends only on the sentences them-
selves, not taking into account the document-level 
information and the sentence-to-document rela-
tionship.

4 The Document-Based Graph Model 
(DGM) 
4.1 Overview 
As we mentioned in previous section, there may be 
many factors that can have impact on the impor-
tance analysis of the sentences. This study aims to 
examine the document impact by incorporating the 
document importance and the sentence-to-
document correlation into the sentence ranking 
process. Our assumption is that the sentences, whi-
ch belong to an important document and are highly 
correlated with the document, will be more likely 
to be chosen into the summary.  
In order to incorporate the document-level in-
formation and the sentence-to-document relation-
ship, the document-based graph model is proposed 
based on the two-layer link graph including both 
sentences and documents. The novel representation 
is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the lower 
layer is just the traditional link graph between sen-
tences that has been well studied in previous work. 
And the upper layer represents the documents. The 
dashed lines between these two layers indicate the 
conditional influence between the sentences and 
the documents.  
 
Figure 2. Two-layer link graph 
Formally, the new representation for the two-
layer graph is denoted as G*=<Vs, Vd, Ess, Esd>, 
where Vs=V={vi} is the set of sentences and 
Vd=D={dj} is the set of documents; Ess=E={eij|vi, 
vj?Vs} includes all possible links between sen-
tences and Esd={eij|vi?Vs, dj?Vd and dj=doc(vi)} 
includes the correlation link between any sentence 
and its belonging document.  Here, we use doc(vi) 
to denote the document containing sentence vi. For 
further discussions, we let ?(doc(vi)) ?[0,1] de-
note the importance of document doc(vi) in the 
document set, and let ?(vi, doc(vi)) ?[0,1] denote 
the strength of the correlation between sentence vi 
and its document doc(vi).   
The two factors are incorporated into the affinity 
weight between sentences and the new sentence-to-
sentence affinity weight is denoted as f(vi, vj|doc(vi), 
doc(vj)), which is conditioned on the two docu-
ments containing the two sentences. The new con-
ditional affinity weight is computed by linearly 
combining the affinity weight conditioned on the 
first document (i.e. f(vi,vj|doc(vi))) and the affinity 
weight conditioned on the second document (i.e. 
f(vi,vj|doc(vj))). 
Formally, the conditional affinity weight is 
computed as follows to incorporate the two factors:

where ??[0,1] is the combination weight control-

ment and the second document. Note that usually 
f(vi, vj|doc(vi), doc(vj)) is not equal to f(vj, vi|doc(vj), 
doc(vi)), but the two scores are equal when ? is set 
to 0.5. Various methods can be used to evaluate the 
document importance and the sentence-document 
correlation, which will be described in next sec-
tions. 
The new affinity matrix M* is then constructed 
based on the above conditional sentence-to-
sentence affinity weight.

Likewise, M* is normalized to *~M  and the itera-

on *~M .  The transition matrix in the Markov chain

4.2 Evaluating Document Importance (?) 
The function ?(doc(vi)) aims to evaluate the impor-
tance of document doc(vi) in the document set D. 
The following three methods are developed to 
evaluate the document importance.

importance scores of the documents. The link 
weight between two documents is computed using 
the cosine measure. The equation for iterative 
computation is the same with Equation (4). 
4.3 Evaluating Sentence-Document Cor-
relation (?) 
The function ?(vi, doc(vi)) aims to evaluate the 
correlation between sentence vi and its document 
doc(vi). The following four methods are developed 
to compute the strength of the correlation. The first 
three methods are based on sentence position in the 
document, under the assumption that the first sen-
tences in a document are usually more important 
than other sentences. The last method is based on 
the content similarity between the sentence and the 
document. 
?1: The correlation strength between sentence vi 
and its document doc(vi) is based on the position of 
the sentence as follows:

where pos(vi) returns the position number of sen-
tence vi in its document. For example, if vi is the 
first sentence in its document, pos(vi) is 1.  
?2: The correlation strength between sentence vi 
and its document doc(vi) is based on the position of 
the sentence as follows:

5 Empirical Evaluation 
5.1 Dataset and Evaluation Metric 
Generic multi-document summarization has been 
one of the fundamental tasks in DUC 20014 and 
DUC 20025 (i.e. task 2 in DUC 2001 and task 2 in 
DUC 2002), and we used the two tasks for evalua-
tion. DUC2001 provided 30 document sets and 
DUC 2002 provided 59 document sets (D088 is 
excluded from the original 60 document sets by 
NIST) and generic abstracts of each document set 
with lengths of approximately 100 words or less 
were required to be created. The documents were 
news articles collected from TREC-9. The sen-
tences in each article have been separated and the 
sentence information has been stored into files.  
The summary of the two datasets are shown in Ta-
ble 1.

We used the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) 
toolkit (i.e. ROUGEeval-1.4.2 in this study) for 
evaluation, which has been widely adopted by 
DUC for automatic summarization evaluation. It 
measured summary quality by counting overlap-
ping units such as the n-gram, word sequences and 
word pairs between the candidate summary and the 
reference summary. ROUGE-N was an n-gram

where n stood for the length of the n-gram, and 
Countmatch(n-gram) was the maximum number of 
n-grams co-occurring in a candidate summary and 
a set of reference summaries. Count(n-gram) was 
the number of n-grams in the reference summaries. 
ROUGE toolkit reported separate scores for 1, 2, 
3 and 4-gram, and also for longest common subse-
quence co-occurrences. Among these different 
scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) 
has been shown to agree with human judgment 
most (Lin and Hovy. 2003). We showed three of 
the ROUGE metrics in the experimental results: 
ROUGE-1 (unigram-based), ROUGE-2 (bigram-
based), and ROUGE-W (based on weighted long-
est common subsequence, weight=1.2). In order to 
truncate summaries longer than length limit, we 
used the “-l” option in ROUGE toolkit. We also 
used the “-m” option for word stemming. 
5.2 Evaluation Results 
In the experiments, the combination weight ? for 
the proposed summarization model is typically set 
to 0.5 without tuning, i.e. the two documents for 
two sentences have equal influence on the summa-
rization process. Note that after the saliency scores 
of sentences have been obtained, a greedy algo-
rithm (Wan and Yang, 2006) is applied to remove 
redundancy and finally choose both informative 
and novel sentences into the summary. The algo-
rithm is actually a variant version of the MMR al-
gorithm (Goldstein et al., 1999). 
The proposed document-based graph model (de-
noted as DGM) with different settings is compared 
with the basic graph-based Model (denoted as GM),  
the top three performing systems and two baseline 
systems on DUC2001 and DUC2002, respectively. 
The top three systems are the systems with highest 
ROUGE scores, chosen from the performing sys-
tems on each task respectively. The lead baseline 
and coverage baseline are two baselines employed 
in the generic multi-document summarization tasks 
of DUC2001 and DUC2002. The lead baseline 
takes the first sentences one by one in the last 
document in the collection, where documents are 
assumed to be ordered chronologically. And the 
coverage baseline takes the first sentence one by 
one from the first document to the last document. 
Tables 2 and 3 show the comparison results on 
DUC2001 and DUC2002, respectively. In Table 1, 
SystemN, SystemP and System T are the top three 
performing systems for DUC2001. In Table 2, Sys-
tem19, System26, System28 are the top three per-
forming systems for DUC2002. The document-
based graph model is configured with different 
settings (i.e. ?1-?3, ?1-?4).  For example, 
DGM(?1+?1) refers to the DGM model with ?1 to 
evaluate the document importance and ?1 to evalu-
ate the correlation between a sentence and its docu-
ment.

Table 3. Comparison results on DUC2002 
(* indicates that the improvement over the baseline GM 
model is statistically significant at 95% confidence level) 
Seen from the tables, the proposed document-
based graph model with different settings can out-
perform the basic graph-based model and other 
baselines over almost all three metrics on both 
760
DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets. The results 
demonstrate the good effectiveness of the proposed 
model, i.e. the incorporation of document impact 
does benefit the graph-based summarization model. 
It is interesting that the three methods for comput-
ing document importance and the four methods for 
computing the sentence-document correlation are 
almost as effective as each other on the DUC2002 
dataset. However, ?1 does not perform as well as ?2 
and ?3, and ?1 and ?4 does not perform as well as 
?2 and ?3 on the DUC2001 dataset.  
In order to investigate the relative contributions 
from the two documents for two sentences to the 
summarization performance, we varies the combi-
nation weight ? from 0 to 1 and Figures 3-6 show 
the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-W curves on 
DUC2001 and DUC2002 respectively. The similar 
ROUGE-2 curves are omitted here.

Figure 6. ROUGE-W vs. ? on DUC2002 
We can see from the figures that the proposed 
document-based graph model with different set-
tings can almost always outperform the basic 
graph-based model, with respect to different values 
of ?. The results show the robustness of the pro-
posed model. We can also see that for most set-
tings of the propose model, very large values or 
very small values of ? can deteriorate the summari-
zation performance, i.e. both the first document 
and the second document in the computation of the 
conditional affinity weight between sentences have 
great impact on the summarization performance.  
6 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper examines the document impact on the 
graph-based model for multi-document summari-
zation. The document-level information and the 
sentence-to-document relationship are incorporated 
into the graph-based ranking algorithm. The ex-
perimental results on DUC2001 and DUC2002 
demonstrate the good effectiveness of the proposed 
model.

In this study, we directly make use of the coarse-
grained document-level information.  Actually, a 
document can be segmented into a few subtopic 
passages by using the TextTiling algorithm (Hearst, 
1997), and we believe the subtopic passage is more 
fine-grained than the original document. In future 
work, we will exploit this kind of subtopic-level 
information to further improve the summarization 
performance.
