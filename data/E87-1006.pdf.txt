ABSTRACT 
A morphologic and morphosyntactic analyzer for the Italian 
language has been implemented in VM/Prolog 131 at the IBM Romc 
Scientific Center as part of a project on text understanding. 
Aim of this project is the development of a prototype which 
analyzes hort narrative texts (press agency news) and gives a formal 
representation f their "meaning" as a set of first order logic 
expressions. Question answering features are also provided. 
The morphologic analyzer processes every word by means of a 
context free grammar, in order to obtain its morphologic and 
syntactic haracteristics. 
It also performs a morphosyntactic analysis to recognize fixed 
and variable sequences of words such as idioms, date cxpressi{~ns, 
compound tenses of verbs and comparative and superlative form~ of 
adjectives. 
The lexicon is stored in a relational data base under thc control 
of SQL/DS \[2\], while the endings of the grammar are stored in thc 
workspace as Proiog facts. 
A friendly interface written in GDDM \[11 allows the uscr to 
introduce on line the missing lemmata, in order to directly ulxlatc thc 
dictionary. 
Introduction 
About thirty years ago, the development of decripting tccniques 
made computer scientists be involved for the first time in the field of 
Linguistics, especially in automatic translation matters. 
The failure of most of these projects contributed to a general 
sensibilization towards natural language problems, and gave rise to a 
variety of formal theories for their treatment. 
In the last few years, one of the main research objectives ix-came 
the design of systems able to acquire knowledge directly from fcxts. 
using natural language as an interface between man and machine. 
At the IBM Rome Scientific Center a system has been developed 
for processing Italian texts. The task of the system is to 
• analyze short narrative texts (press agency news) on a restricted 
domain (Economics and Finance), 
• give the formal representation f their "meaning" as a set of first 
order logic expressions, tored in a knowledge base, 
• consult this knowledge base in order to answer any qucstlon 
about he contents of analyzed texts. 
The system consists of: 
• a mmphologie analyzer based on a context-free logic grammar 
with the "word" as axiom and its possible components as 
terminal nodes. It.includes a lexic9n of about 7000 elementary 
lemmata, structured in a table of a relational data base under the 
control of SQL/DS. 
* a morphosyntaetic analyzer ealized by three regular grammars, 
recognizing respectively compound tenses of verbs (e,g. ha.~ been 
signed), comparative and superlative forms of adjectives (e.g. Ihe 
most interesting) and compound numbers (e.g. three billions .~64 
millions 234.000). This module reduces the number of possible 
syntactic relations among the words of the sentence in order to 
simplify the task of the syntax. 
* a syntactic parser developed by means of a meta-analyzcr \[6\[ 
which aUows to write production rules for attribute gntmmars, 
and generates from these the corresponding top-down parser. A 
grammar has been written to describe the fragment of Italian 
consider.~l. 
• a semantic la'oe~sm • based on the Conceptual Graphs formal;sin 
\[10\] and provided, with a semantic dictionary containing at 
present about 350 concepts. Its task is to solve syntactic 
ambiguities and recognize semantic relations between the words 
of the sentence 191. 
This paper deals in particular with the structure of the lexicon 
adopted in tht: system and with the morhologic and morhosynlactic 
analyzer. 
In this system the morphology and the lexicon are strictly 
combined; for this reason this lexicon does not contain semanlic 
information. In the approach of Alinei \[4\], on the contrary, lexicon 
structures contain semantic information in order to describe every 
word also in te~qns of its "meaning" 
Another possible approach is the one adopted by Zampolli who 
developed a frequency lexicon of Italian language at tile 
Computational Linguistic Institute in Pisa \[5\]. The lexicon realized 
by ZampoUi's working group containes morphologie hints in order to 
guide directly the analysis of every word, without the support of a 
morphologic p~ rser. 
in most of the works referring to English language morphology is
considered onl) as a part of the syntactic parser. On the contrary. 
Italian morpho'ogy requires to be previously analyzed because it is 
more complex: there are more rules than in English and these rides 
present many exceptions. 
For this reason, in the last few years Italian researchers began to 
face systematically these problems beside a purely linguistic onlcxk 
A procedural approach is the one followed by Stock in the 
development of a morphologlc analyzer realized for lhe 
"Wednesday2" parser I 11\[. 
A different approach makes use of formal grammars to describe 
the rules of Italian morphology. This morhologic analyzer is based 
on a context free grammar describing the logic rules for the word 
generation. Other two morphologic systems have been developed 
according to the ATN formalism (Augmcuted Transition Network). 
The fast one has been realized at the CNR Institute of I'is~ by 
Morreale, Campagnola and MugeUesi, as a research tool for teaching 
Italian morphology, with applications in automatic processin¢ of 
32 
natural anguage and knowledge representation 18\]. The second one 
has been realized by Delmonte, Mian, Omologo and Satta, as part of 
a system for the development of a reading machine for blind people. 
171. 
In the first section of this paper there is a brief discussion atx, ut 
morphologic problems and about the possible approaches to their 
solution. 
The next section describes the structure adopted for the lexicon 
and the other sets of data. 
The third section deals with a preanalyzer, which simplifies the 
work of morphologie analysis by recognizing standard sequences of 
words, as idioms and date expressions. 
In the fourth section the morphologic analyzer is described and 
in the last one the morphosyntactic analyzer, both realized by means 
of context free grammars. 
The problem 
The aim of morphology is to retrieve from every analyzed word 
the lemma it derives from, its syntactic ategory (e.g. verb, . .un, 
adjective, conjunction . . . .  ) and its morphologic catego~ (e.g. 
masculine, singular, indicative .... ). 
A possible approach to the problem is to store in a data base a 
list of all the declined forms for every lemma of the language, as well 
as their morphologic, syntactic and semantic haracteristics. 
The size of such a list would be enormous, because a common 
dictionary contains about 50000-100000 lemmata and each lemma 
gives rise to several derived words and each word may be declined in 
different ways. 
Such a large data base is hard to enter and to update, and it is 
limited by the fixed size of its words list. 
In Italian, the creation of words is a generative proces~ ~hat 
follows several roles like, for instance: 
HANO 
(hand) 
---> verbalization ---> HAN-EGGIARE 
(to hand-le) 
---> composition ---> PALLA-MANO 
(hand-ball) 
---> olitlcization ---> RI-MAN-EGGIARE 
(to re-hand-le) 
In English, rules like composition or cliticization are not strictly 
morphologlc, because they often involve more than a word. In 
Italian, on the contrary, they modify the single word, producing new 
words like, for instance: 
- - ->  a l te ra t ion  - - ->  CART-ACCIA 
(waste paper) 
CARTA ---> composition ---> CARTA-MONETA 
(paper) (paper money) 
---> cliticization ---> IN-CART-ARE 
(to wrap in paper) 
These rules make the set of Italian words potentially unlimiled, 
and sometimes make insufficient even a common dictionary. 
A different approach takes two different lists: one containing the 
lemmata of the language and the other the logic rules of derivations, 
from which all the correct Italian words can be produced starting 
from the lemmata. 
These rules can be easily described by means of a context-free 
grammar, in which every "word" results from the concatenation of 
the "stem" of a lemma with alterations, affixes, endings and enelities. 
This grammar can both generate from a given lemma all the 
current Italian words deriving from it and analyze a given word by 
giving all the possible lemmata it derives from. 
The backtracking mechanism of Prolog directly allows to obtain 
all the solutions. 
This morphologic analyzer can also provide further information 
about some linguistic peculiarities, like, for instance: 
compound names 
modal verbs 
altered names 
pelle-rossa (red-skin), which has as plural 
peUi-rosse. 
which take another verb as object (1 can 
go) 
foglia (leaf) can be altered in fogli-olina 
(leaf-let), whose meaning is piccola foglia 
(small leaf). 
Data structure 
A correct morphologie analysis requires not only knowledgc on 
the language lemmata, but also on the word components as 
alterations, affixes, endings and enclitics. This information might hc 
represented in form of Prolog facts. In this way, data mighl be 
directly accessed by the program, because the homogeneity of their 
structure. The disadvantage is a performance degradation when the 
size of data increases, since Prolog is not provided with efficient 
search algorithms. 
Hence it seemed convenient to draw a distinction between data: 
on one hand the set of lemmata, and on the other the sets of affixes, 
alterations, endings and enclitics. The former (which is the most 
relevant and needs to be continuously updated), has been struclurcd 
as a relational data base table, managed by the SQI,/DS. The 
advantage is that this system is directly accessible from VM/Prolog 
(the string containing the query is processed by SQI., which returns 
the answer as a Prolog list). The latter (which have fixed lenghl and 
are not so large), have been stored in the Prolog workspace i, f ,  rm 
of Prolog facts. 
The set of lemmata is a table with five attributes: 
1. the fu'st is the lemma. 
2. the second is the stem (the invariable part of the lemma): this is 
the access key in the table. 
3. the third is the name of the "class of endings" associated with 
every lemma. A class of endings is the set of all the endings 
related to a given class of words. For example, each of the 
regular verbs of the first conjugation has the same endings; hence 
there exists a class named dv_leonjug containing all and only 
these endings. Generally each irregular verb is related to different 
classes of endings: andare (to go), for example, admits two 
different stems, vad (go) and and (went); so there exist two 
subclasses of endings named respectively dvl andare and 
dr2 andare. 
4. the fourth attribute is the syntactic ategory of the lemma: Ior 
example, the information that to have is an auxiliary transitive 
verb. 
5. the fifth is an integer identifying the type of analysis Iobc  
performed: 
I the analysis can be performed completely 
2 the lemma can neither be altered nor affixed (this is 
the case for example of prepositions and 
conjunctions) 
3 only the longest analysis of the lemma is considered 
(this is the case of the false alterated nouns: 
mattino (morning) is not a little matto (mad), such 
as in english outlet is not a little out!) 
33

mattino mattin dn_oggctto noun.common 3 
di di --- prep.simple 2 
andare vad dv 1 _andare v.intran.simple 1 
andare and I dv2. andar© v.intran.simple I 
The other sets of data are contained in the Prolog workspace and 
are structured as tables of a relational data base. 
The set of the classes of endings is a table with three attributes: 
l . 
2. 
3. 
the first is the name of the class and it is the access key in the 
table. 
the second is one of the endings belonging to the class 
the third is the morphologic ategory associated with the ending: 
for example, the class dn..oggetto contains the two endings which 
are used in order to inlleet all the masculine nouns behaving like 
the word oggetto (object): o for the singular (oggett-o), and i for 
the plural (oggett-O. 
eading..da~ ending morph_categ 
dn_oggctto o mas.sing. 
dn_oggetto i mas.phir. 
The affixes can be divided in la'eflxcs preceding the stem of the 
lemma, and suffixes following the stem of the lemma. 
The prefixes are simply listed by means of a one attribute table. 
In this way it is not necessary to list the prefixed words in the 
lexicon: they are obtained by chaining the prefix with the original 
word. For example, from the verb to handle with the prefix re we 
obtain the verb to rehandle. Morphologlc and syntactic 
characteristics remain the same; for the verbs only, the prefixed verb 
differs sometimes from the previous one in the syntactic atlribules 
(transitive/intransitive, simple/modal). 
The set of suffixes is a table with four attributes: 
I. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
the first is the suffix itself 
the second is the stem of the suffix (the access key to the table) 
the third is the ending class of the suffix 
the fourth is the syntactic lass of the suffix. Suffixcs, in fact, 
differently from prefixes, changes both morphologic and syntactic 
characteristics of the original word: they change verbs into names 
or adjectives (deverba/suff'oces), names into verbs or adjectives 
(denominal suffixes), adjectives into verbs or names (deadje:tival 
suffixes). The first attribute is chained to the stem of the original 
lemma in order to obtain the derived lemma: for example, from 
the stem of the lemrna mattino (morning), which is a noun, with 
the suffix iero, we obtain the new lemma mattin-iero (early 
rising), which is an adjective, and from the second stem of the 
lemma andare (to go), which is a verb, with the suffix amento, 
we obtain the new lemma and-amento (walking), which is a 
noun.

The set of alteration is a table with three attributes: 
1. the first is the stem of the alteration (the access key in the tablc l
2. the second is the ending class of the alteration 
3. the third is the semantic type of the alteration. Alterations 
change the morphologic and semantic characteristics of the 
altered word, but not its syntactic athegory: for example, the 
lemma easa (house) can be altered in casina (little house), 
easona (big house), easaeeia (ugly house), and so on: 
stem endinLda.~ seman categ 
in da belle diminutive 
on dn_cosa augmentative 
acc da_~bio  pejorative 
The cnclitics are pronouns linked to the ending of a verb: for 
example va li" (go there) can be expressed also in the form vaeei (ci is 
the ¢nclitic, the c is duplicated according with a phonetic rule). 
The set of the enclitics is a table with two attributes: the first is 
the maclitic (this is the access key to the table) and the second is the 
morphologlc haracteristic of the encfitic. The analy-zer divides the 
verb from the enclitic, so that it becomes a different word, taking the 
morphologlc characteristic stated in the table and the syntactic 
category of pronoun. 
Other two sets of data have been defined in order to handle fixed 
sequences of words, such as proper names and idioms. 
The set of the most common italian idioms has been structured 
as a table with two attributes: the first one is the idiom itself, while 
the second is the syntactic ategory of the idiom. In this way it is 
possible to recognize the idiom without performing the analysis of 
each of the component words. For example, di mode che (in such a 
way as) is an idiom used in the role of a conjunction, and a mane a 
matzo (little by little) is used in the role of an adverb. 
The set of proper names belonging to the context of Economics 
and Finance is a table with three attributes: the first is the proper 
name, the second its syntactic ategory and the third its moq~hologic 
category.

Montcpolimeri Montedison name.prop.comp, fern.sing. 
Vittorio Ripa di Meana name.prop.pers, mas.sing. 
Regglo Emilia name.prop.lee, fern.sing. 
The Preanalyzer 
The preanalyzer simplifies the work of analysis recognizing all the 
"fixed" sequences of words in the sentence. 
Fixed sequences of words arc, for example, idioms like in such a 
way as. To analyze this sequence of words it is not necessary to 
know that in is a preposition, such is an adjective, a an article, and so 
on: the only useful information is that this sequence takes the role of 
conjunction. Other fixed sequences of words are proper names: it is 
necessary to know, for example, that Montepolimeri Montedi.wn or 
Vittorio Ripa di Meana are single entities. 
Idioms and proper names are recognized by means of a pattern 
matching algorithm: the comparison is made between the lll|,tll 
sentence and the first attribute of the tables of idioms and proper 
names. When the comparison fails, backtracking evaluates another 
hypothesis. Every recogniz~ed sequence of words is written on an 
appropriate fde and then removed from the input sentence. 
Date expressions, as lunedi' 13 agosto (monday, august tile /3rd), 
arc considered as single entities, in order to simplify the work of 
syntax. They are recognized by means of a context-free grammar, 
34 
whose axiom is the "date': 
I DATE --> <name_proper_wday> <DAI> 
2 DATE --> <DAI> 
3 DATE --> <DA2> 
4 DAI --> <number(<31)> <nameproper_month> 
5 DAI --> <number(<31)> <DA2> 
6 DA2 --> <nameproper_month> <number> 
Figure I. The grammar for the DATE 
Numbers are recognized by the library function numb(*) and by 
means of a context-free grammar translating strings into numbers. In 
this way it is possible to evaluate in the same way expressions such 
as 1352 and milletreeentoeinquantadue (one thousand three hundred 
and fifty two).

13 NUH4 --> <tens> 
14 NUH4 --> <tens> <units>

The morphologic analyzer 
This is the main module of the whole system. Its task is to 
analyse ach element (word) of the list received from the preanalyser 
and to produce for every form analyzed the list of all its 
characteristics: 
I. the lemma it derives from 
2. its syntactic haracteristics 
3. its morphoiogic characteristics (none for invariable words) 
4. the list of alterations (possibly empty) 
5. the list of enclitics (possibly empty). 
For example the form sono (the ist sing. and the 3rd plur. person 
of the present indicative of essere, to be), after the analysi~ is 
represented by the list: 
( S ono. 
(V. in t  ran .  aux. ind .  p res .  ac t .  1. s ing .  es s e re .  n i 1 ) .  
(v .  in t  ran .  aux. ind .  p res .  ac t .  3. p lu r .  essere ,  n i l  ) .  
n i l )  
Every Italian word is made up by a fundamental nuclc,s, tile 
stem (two for the compound names). This is preceded by one or 
more prefixes, and followed by one or more suffixes and alterati,,ns, 
by an ending and, as far as the verbs are concerned, by one or more 
enclitics. 
This structure has been described by means of a context-free 
grammar in which the "word" is the axiom and all its comlxmcnts 
the endings. 
1 WORD --> {prefix'} n <stem> <REM> 
2 REM --> {suffix)'* {alteration}  <TALL> 
3 REM --> <ending> {suffix}" {alteration}" <TAl l .>

cassa-forte (steel-safe) casse-forti 
The task of this part of the morphology is to: 
reeoguize all the "well-formed" words of Italian language. 
The analyzer parses the words from left to right, splitting them 
into elementary parts: prefix(es), the stem(s) of the appropriate 
lemma(ta) of derivation (retrieved from a restricted dictionary 
reporting only the "elementary lemmata') suffix(es), alteration(s), 
ending(s), enclitic(s). Each hypothesis is checked by verifying 
that all the conditions for a right composition of those parts are 
satisfied. 
2. submit every word not recognized to the user, who can state 
wether: 
® the word is really wrong, because of 
- an orthographic error: for example squola instead of scuola 
(school). 
- a composition error: for example serviziazione is wrong as 
'iazione' is a deverbal suffix and 'serviz" is the stem of the 
noun 'servizio' (service) and the corresponding verb does not 
exist. 
a the word derives from a lemma which is not reported in the 
lexicon. In this case the user can recall a graphic interface, 
allowing him/her to update directly the lexicon. 
3. perform, if requested by the user, an inspection in the list of the 
"currently used" words. In this way, for example, the user knows 
that coton-~eio (cotton-mill) and coton-iera re two well-formed 
Italian words, but that only the first one is commonly used. 
The morphosyntactic analyzer 
The aim of the morphosyntactic analyzer is to perform the 
analysis of the contiguous words in the sentence, in order to 
recognize regular structures uch as compound tenses of verbs and 
comparative and superlative forms of adjectives. 
Compound tenses of verbs are described by means of a regular 
grammar, whose rules are applied any time the analyzer finds in the 
sentence the past participle of the verb. These rules arc: 
I C0MP:ZNSZ 
2 COMP TENSE 
3 REM 
4 REM 
5 REM 
--> <v.tran.aux.> 
<v. tran.(past.part.)> 
--> <v.intran.aux.> <REM> 
--> <v.intran.aux.(past.psrt)> 
<v.tran.(past.part)> 
--> <v.tran.(past.part)> 
--> <v.intran.(past.part)> 
Figure 8. The grammar for the COMPOUND TENSEs of verbs 
When a rule is successfully applied the morphologic ategories of 
the verbs are changed and the attribute 'active'/'passive' can bc 
specified correctly. For example, after the morphosyntactic analysis. 
the phrase io suno chiamato (I'm called) 
( ( io .  
(p ron .  pets .  1. s ing .  io .  n i l ) .  
n i l ) .  
( s ono. 
(v. intran, aux. ind. pres. act. 1. sing. essere, ni I ). 
(v. int ran. aux. ind. pres. act. 3. plur. essere, ni \] ). 
n i l ) .  
(ehiamato. 
(v. tran. sire. part. past. act. mas. sing. chiamare, ni I ). 
n i l ) .  
nil) 
becomes 
( ( io .  
(pron. pers. 1. s ing. io. nil). 
n i l ) .  
( sono_chiamato. 
(v. tran. s \]an. pass. ind. pres. 1. sing. chiamare, ni I ). 
n i l ) .  
n i l ) .  
in which only the fu-st analysis of the word "sono" has been taken, as 
the number of the auxiliary verb must correspond to the nu,nber of 
the past participle. The form is passive, as "chiamare" (to call) is a 
transitive verb (the auxiliary verb for the active form is to have). In 
36 
this case morphosyntactic analysis has solved an ambiguity: only an 
interpretation will be analyzed by syntax. 
The following figure shows the task of the grammar, applied any 
time the parser finds the past participle of a verb in the sentence. 
® If the verb is transitive the parser looks at the word BF.FORE 
the verb: 
- if the word is a tense of the verb to be, the resulting verb is 
SIMPLE PASSIVE (the rules applied are the 2nd and the 
4th); 
- if the word is a tense of the verb to have, the resulting verb is 
COMPOUND ACTIVE (the rule applied is the lst). 
u If the verb is intransitive the parser looks at the word AF'I'FR 
the verb: 
- if it is the past participle of another verb the resulting vcrh is 
COMPOUND PASSIVE (the rules appfied are the 2nd and 
the 3rd); 
- otherwise it is COMPOUND ACTIVE (the rules applied arc 
the 2nd and the 5th).

The grammar for the comparative and supcrlativc forms of 
adjectives is applied any time the analyzer finds thc words piu' 
(more), meno (less) followed by a qualificative adjective. In this way 
it is possible to recognize and to distinguish expressions like piu' 
interessante (more interesting) and il pin' interessante (the most 
interesting). Remark that in English there is the use of more, most to 
make cleat the distinction between the comparativc and the 
superlative form of the adjective.

In the same manner it is possible to recognize mixed numeric 
expressions like three billions 564 millions 234000 and to cwduate 
thcrn into their equivalent numeric form (3564234000). The talcs arc 
applied any time the analyzer finds the words miliardi (billions), 
milioni (millions) in the sentence. 
1 NUH COMP --> <agg.num> <'mlllardo'> <NUHI> 
2 NUH-COMP --> <agg.num> <'miliardo'> <agg.num> 
3 NUH_-COHP --> <agg.num> <'mlliardo'> 
4 NUH COMP --> <NUHI> 
5 NUHT --> <agg.num> <'millone'> <agg.num> 
6 NUH1 --> <agg.num> <'millone'>

This approach presents the advantage of a higher flexibilily in the 
analysis of words. Moreover such a method has requested a strong 
initial effort in the formalization of the rules (with all their 
exceptions) for the morphologic treatment of words, but has largely 
simplified the work of classification of every Italian word. 
The lexicon stores about 7000 elementary lemmata, derived from 
a list of about 20000 different Italian forms. They correspond to 
about 15000 ordinary lemmata (entries of a common dictionary).
