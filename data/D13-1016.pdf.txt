Abstract
Domain adaptation has been popularly stud-
ied on exploiting labeled information from a
source domain to learn a prediction model in
a target domain. In this paper, we develop a
novel representation learning approach to ad-
dress domain adaptation for text classification
with automatically induced discriminative la-
tent features, which are generalizable across
domains while informative to the prediction
task. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
multinomial Naive Bayes model with latent
variables to conduct supervised word cluster-
ing on labeled documents from both source
and target domains, and then use the produced
cluster distribution of each word as its la-
tent feature representation for domain adapta-
tion. We train this latent graphical model us-
ing a simple expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. We empirically evaluate the pro-
posed method with both cross-domain doc-
ument categorization tasks on Reuters-21578
dataset and cross-domain sentiment classifica-
tion tasks on Amazon product review dataset.
The experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed approach achieves superior perfor-
mance compared with alternative methods.
1 Introduction
Supervised prediction models typically require a
large amount of labeled data for training. However,
manually collecting data annotations is expensive in
many real-world applications such as document cat-
egorization or sentiment classification. Recently, do-
main adaptation has been proposed to exploit exist-
ing labeled data in a related source domain to assist
the prediction model training in the target domain
(Ben-David et al., 2006; Blitzer et al., 2006; Daume´
III, 2007; Blitzer et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012). As
an effective tool to reduce annotation effort, domain
adaptation has achieved success in various cross-
domain natural language processing (NLP) systems
such as document categorization (Dai et al., 2007),
sentiment classification (Blitzer et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2012; Mejova and Srinivasan, 2012; Chen
et al., 2011), email spam detection (Jiang and Zhai,
2007), and a number of other NLP tasks (Blitzer
et al., 2011; Daume´ III, 2007).
One primary challenge of domain adaptation lies
in the distribution divergence of the two domains
in the original feature representation space. For ex-
ample, documents about books may contain very
different high-frequency words and discriminative
words from documents about kitchen. A good cross-
domain feature representation thus has been viewed
as critical for bridging the domain divergence gap
and facilitating domain adaptation in the NLP area
(Ben-David et al., 2006, 2010). Many domain adap-
tation works have been proposed to learn new
cross-domain feature representations (Blitzer et al.,
2006, 2011). Though demonstrated good perfor-
mance on certain problems, these works mostly in-
duce new feature representations in an unsupervised
way, without taking the valuable label information
into account.
In this work, we present a novel supervised rep-
resentation learning approach to discover a latent
representation of words which is not only general-
izable across domains but also informative to the
classification task. Specifically, we propose a hier-
152
archical multinomial Naive Bayes model with la-
tent word cluster variables to perform supervised
word clustering on labeled documents from both do-
mains. Our model directly models the relationships
between the observed document label variables and
the latent word cluster variables. The induced clus-
ter representation of each word thus will be infor-
mative for the classification labels, and hence dis-
criminative for the target classification task. We train
this directed graphical model using an expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm, which maximizes the
log-likelihood of the observations of labeled docu-
ments. The induced cluster distribution of each word
can then be used as its generalizable representa-
tion to construct new cluster-based representation of
each document. For domain adaptation, we train a
supervised learning system with labeled data from
both domains in the new representation space and
apply it to categorize test documents in the target do-
main. In order to evaluate the proposed technique,
we conduct extensive experiments on the Reuters-
21578 dataset for cross-domain document catego-
rization and on Amazon product review dataset for
cross-domain sentiment classification. The experi-
mental results show the proposed approach can pro-
duce more effective representations than the com-
parison domain adaptation methods.
2 Related Work
Domain adaptation has recently been popularly
studied in natural language processing and a variety
of domain adaptation approaches have been devel-
oped, including instance weighting adaptation meth-
ods and feature representation learning methods.
Instance weighting adaptation methods improve
the transferability of a prediction model by training
an instance weighted learning system. Much work in
this category has been developed to address differ-
ent weighting schemas (Sugiyama et al., 2007; Wan
et al., 2011). Jiang and Zhai (2007) applied instance
weighting algorithms to tackle cross-domain NLP
tasks and proposed to remove misleading source
training data and assign less weights to labeled data
from the source domain than labeled data from the
target domain. Dai et al. (2007) proposed to increase
the weights of mistakenly predicted instances from
the target domain and decrease the weights of incor-
rectly predicted instances from the source domain
during an iterative training process.
Representation learning methods bridge do-
main divergence either by differentiating domain-
invariant features from domain-specific features
(Daume´ III, 2007; Daume´ III et al., 2010; Blitzer
et al., 2011; Finkel and Manning, 2009) or seeking
generalizable latent features across domains (Blitzer
et al., 2006, 2007; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010).
Daume´ III (2007); Daume´ III et al. (2010) proposed
a simple heuristic feature replication method to rep-
resent common, source specific and target specific
features. Finkel and Manning (2009) proposed a for-
mer version of it based on the use of a hierarchi-
cal Bayesian prior. Blitzer et al. (2011) proposed
a coupled subspace learning method, which learns
two projectors, one for each domain, to project the
original features into domain-sharing and domain-
specific features. Blitzer et al. (2006) proposed a
structural correspondence learning (SCL) method to
model the correlation between pivot features and
non-pivot features. It uses the correlation to in-
duce latent domain-invariant features as augment-
ing features for supervised learning. Extensions of
this work include improving pivot feature selection
(Blitzer et al., 2007; Prettenhofer and Stein, 2010),
and improving the correlation modeling between
pivot and non-pivot features (Tan, 2009).
The proposed approach in this paper belongs to
representation learning methods. However, unlike
the unsupervised representation learning methods
reviewed above, our proposed approach learns gen-
eralizable feature representations of words by ex-
ploiting data labels from the two domains.
3 Learning Latent Word Representations
using Supervised Word Clustering
In this paper, we address domain adaptation for
text classification. Given a source domain DS with
plenty of labeled documents, and a target domain
DT with a very few labeled documents, the task is
to learn a classifier from the labeled documents in
both domains, and use it to classify the unlabeled
documents in the target domain. The documents in
the two domains share the same universal vocabu-
lary V = {w1, w2, · · · , wn}, but the word distri-
butions in the two domains are typically different.
153
Therefore, training the classification model directly
from the original word feature space V may not gen-
eralize well in the target domain.
We propose to address this problem by first learn-
ing a supervised mapping function ? : V ?? Z
from the labeled documents in both domains, which
maps the input word features in the large vocabu-
lary set V into a low dimensional latent feature space
Z . By filtering out unimportant details and noises,
we expect the low dimensional mapping can cap-
ture the intrinsic structure of the input data that is
discriminative for the classification task and gener-
alizable across domains. In particular, we learn such
a mapping function by conducting supervised word
clustering on the labeled documents using a hierar-
chical multinomial Naive Bayes model. Below, we
will first introduce this supervised word clustering
model and then use the mapping function produced
to transform documents in different domains into the
same low-dimensional space for training cross do-
main text classification systems.
3.1 Supervised Word Clustering
Given all labeled documents from the source and
target domains, D = {(wt, yt)}Tt=1, where the t-th
labeled document is expressed as a bag of words,
wt = {wt1, wt2, · · · , wtNt}, and its label value is
yt ? Y for Y = {1, · · · ,K}, we propose to per-
form supervised word clustering by modeling the
document-label pair distribution using a hierarchical
multinomial Naive Bayes model given in Figure 1,
which has a middle layer of latent cluster variables.
In this plate model, the variable Yt denotes the
observed class label for the t-th document, and all
the label variables, {Yt}Tt=1, share the same multi-
nomial distribution ?Y across documents. The la-
tent variable Ct,i denotes the cluster membership
of the word Wt,i, and all the cluster variables,
{Ct,i}T,Ntt=1,i=1, share the same set of conditional dis-
tributions {?C|y}Ky=1 across documents and words.
The variable Wt,i denotes the i-th observed word
in the t-th document, and all the word variables,
{Wt,i}T,Ntt=1,i=1, share the same set of conditional dis-
tributions {?W |c}mc=1. Here we assume the number
of word clusters is m. For simplicity, we do not show
the distribution parameter variables in the Figure.
Following the Markov property of directed graph-
Figure 1: Supervised word clustering model.
ical models, we can see that given the cluster vari-
able values, the document label variables will be
completely independent of the word variables. By
learning this latent directed graphical model, we
thus expect the important classification information
expressed in the input observation words can be
effectively summarized into the latent cluster vari-
ables. This latent model is much simpler than the
supervised topic models (Blei and McAuliffe, 2007),
but we will show later that it can suitably produce a
generalizable feature mapping function for domain
adaptation.
To train the latent graphical model in Fig-
ure 1 on labeled documents D, we use a standard
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm (Demp-
ster et al., 1977) to maximize the marginal log-
likelihood of the observations:
LL(D;?) =
?
t
logP (yt,wt|?) (1)
The EM algorithm is an iterative procedure. In each
iteration, it takes an alternative E-step and M-step
to maximize the lower bound of the marginal log-
likelihood function. In our experiments, we start
from a random initialization of the model parame-
ters and the latent variable values, and then perform
iterative EM updates until converge to a local opti-
mal solution.
3.2 Induced Word Representation
After training the supervised clustering model using
EM algorithm, a set of local optimal model parame-
ters ?? will be returned, which define a joint distri-
bution over the three groups of variables in the di-
rected graphical model. Next we define a supervised
latent feature mapping function ? from this trained
154
model to map each word w in the vocabulary V into
a conditional distribution vector over the word clus-
ter variable, such as
?(w)=[P (c=1|w,??), · · · , P (c=m|w,??)]. (2)
The conditional distributions involved in this map-
ping function can be computed as
P (c|w,??)=
?
y?YP (w|c,??)P (c|y,??)P (y|??)
P (w)
(3)
where P (w|c,??) = ??w|c P (c|y,??) = ??c|y and
P (y|??) = ??y can be determined from the model
parameters directly, and p(w) can be computed as
the empirical frequency of word w among all the
other words in all the training documents.
We then define a transformation matrix ? ?
Rn×m based on the mapping function ? defined in
Eq. (2), such that ?i: = ?(wi) where wi is the i-th
word in the vocabulary V . That is, each row of ?
is the induced representation vector for one word. ?
can be viewed as a soft word clustering matrix, and
?i,j denotes the probability of word wi belongs to
the j-th cluster. Given the original document-word
frequency matrix Xtr ? RT×n for the labeled train-
ing documents from the two domains, we can con-
struct its representations Ztr ? RT×m in the pre-
dictive latent clustering space by performing the fol-
lowing transformation:
Ztr = Xtr?. (4)
Similarly, we can construct the new representation
matrix Zts for the test data Xts in the target domain.
We then train a classification model on the labeled
data Ztr and apply it to classify the test data Zts.
4 Experiments
We evaluate the proposed approach with experi-
ments on cross domain document categorization of
Reuters data and cross domain sentiment classifi-
cation of Amazon product reviews, comparing to a
number of baseline and existing domain adaptation
methods. In this section, we report the experimental
setting and results on these two data sets.
4.1 Approaches
We compared our proposed supervised word cluster-
ing approach (SWC) with the following five compar-
ison methods for domain adaptation:
(1) BOW: This is a bag-of-word baseline method,
which trains a SVM classifier with labeled data
from both domains using the original bag-of-
word features.
(2) PLSA: This is an unsupervised word clustering
method, which first applies the probabilistic la-
tent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999)
to obtain word clusterings with both labeled and
unlabeled data from the two domains and then
uses the soft word clusterings as augmenting
features to train SVM classifiers.
(3) FDLDA: This is an alternative supervised word
clustering method we built by training the
Fast-Discriminative Latent Dirichlet Allocation
model (Shan et al., 2009) with all labeled data
from the two domains. After training the model,
we used the learned topic distribution p(z) and
the conditional word distributions p(w|z) to
compute the conditional distribution over topics
p(z|w) for each word as the soft clustering of the
word. We then used the soft word clusterings as
augmenting features to train SVM classifiers.
(4) SCL: This is the structural correspondence
learning based domain adaptation method
(Blitzer et al., 2006). It first induces generaliz-
able features with all data from both domains
by modeling the correlations between pivot fea-
tures and non-pivot features, and then uses the
produced generalizable features as augmenting
features to train SVM classifiers.
(5) CPSP: This is coupled subspace learning based
domain adaptation method (Blitzer et al., 2011).
It first learns two domain projectors using all
data from the two domains by approximating
multi-view dimensionality reduction, and then
projects the labeled data to low dimensional la-
tent feature space to train SVM Classifiers.
We used the LIBSVM package (Chang and Lin,
2011) with its default parameter setting to train lin-
ear SVM classifiers as the base classification model
for all comparison methods.

4.2 Experiments on Reuters Data Set
We used the popularly studied Reuters-21578
dataset (Dai et al., 2007), which contains three cross-
domain document categorization tasks, Orgs vs Peo-
ple, Orgs vs Places, People vs Places. The source
and target domains of each task contain documents
sampled from different non-overlapping subcate-
gories. From example, the task of Orgs vs People
assigns a document into one of the two top cate-
gories (Orgs, People), and the source domain doc-
uments and the target domain documents are sam-
pled from different subcategories of Orgs and Peo-
ple. There are 1237 source documents and 1208 tar-
get documents for the task of Orgs vs People, 1016
source documents and 1043 target documents for the
task of Orgs vs Places, and 1077 source documents
and 1077 target documents for the task ofPeople vs
Places. For each task, we built a unigram vocabulary
based on all the documents from the two domains
and represented each document as a feature vector
containing term frequency values.
4.2.1 Experimental Results for Cross-Domain
Document Categorization
For each of the three cross-domain document cat-
egorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset, we used
all the source documents as labeled training data
while randomly selecting 100 target documents as
labeled training data and setting the rest as unla-
beled test data. For the BOW baseline method, we
used the term-frequency features. The other five ap-
proaches are based on representation learning, and
we selected the dimension size of the representation
learning, i.e., the cluster number in our proposed ap-
proach, from {5, 10, 20, 50, 100} according to the
average classification results over 3 runs on the task
of Orgs vs People. The dimension sizes of the in-
duced representations for the five approaches, PLSA,
FDLDA, SCL, CPSP and SWC are 20, 20, 100, 100
and 20 respectively.
We then repeated each experiment 10 times on
each task with different random selections of the 100
labeled target documents to compare the six compar-
ison approaches. The average classification results
in terms of accuracy and standard deviations are re-
ported in Table 1. We can see that by simply combin-
ing labeled documents from the two domains with-
out adaptation, the BOW method performs poorly
across the three tasks. The PLSA method outper-
forms the BOW method over all the three tasks with
small improvements. The supervised word cluster-
ing method FDLDA, though performing slightly bet-
ter than the unsupervised clustering method PLSA,
produces poor performance comparing to the pro-
posed SWC method. One possible reason is that
the FDLDA model is not specialized for supervised
word clustering, and it uses a logistic regression
model to predict the labels from the word topics,
while the final soft word clustering is computed from
the learned distribution p(z) and p(w|z). That is,
in the FDLDA model the labels only influence the
word clusterings indirectly and hence its influence
can be much smaller than the influence of labels as
direct parent variables of the word cluster variables
in the SWC model. The two domain adaptation ap-
proaches, SCL and CPSP, both produce significant
improvements over BOW, PLSA and FDLDA on the
two tasks of Orgs vs People and Orgs vs Places,
while the CPSP method produces slightly inferior
performance than PLSA and FDLDA on the task of
People vs Places. The proposed method SWC on
the other hand consistently and significantly outper-
forms all the other comparison methods across all
the three tasks.
We also studied the sensitivity of the proposed
approach with respect to the number of clusters,

i.e., the dimension size of the learned representa-
tion. We experimented with a set of different val-
ues m ? {5, 10, 20, 50, 100} as the number of clus-
ters. For each m value, we used the same experimen-
tal setting as above and repeated the experiments 10
times to obtain the average comparison results. The
classification accuracy results on the three tasks are
reported in Figure 2. We can see that the proposed
method is not very sensitive to the number of clus-
ters, across the set of increasing values we consid-
ered, and its performance becomes very stable after
the cluster number reaches 20.
4.2.2 Document Categorization Accuracy vs
Label Complexity in Target Domain
We next conducted experiments to compare the
six approaches by varying the amount of the labeled
data from the target domain. We tested a set of dif-
ferent values, s ? {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}, as the
number of labeled documents from the target do-
main. For each different s value, we repeated the ex-
periments 10 times by randomly selecting s labeled
documents from the target domain using the same
experimental setting as before. The comparison re-
sults across the set of s values are plotted in Fig-
ure 3. We can see that in general the performance of
each method improves with the increase of the num-
ber of labeled documents from the target domain.
The proposed method SWC and the domain adapta-
tion method SCL clearly outperform the other four
methods. Moreover, the proposed method SWC not
only maintains consistent and significant advantages
over all other methods across the range of differ-
ent s values, its performance with 300 labeled tar-
get instances is even superior to the other methods
with 500 labeled target instances. All these results
suggest the proposed approach is very effective for
adapting data across domains.
4.3 Experiments on Amazon Product Reviews
We conducted cross-domain sentiment classification
on the widely used Amazon product reviews (Blitzer
et al., 2007), which contains review documents dis-
tributed in four categories: Books(B), DVD(D), Elec-
tronics(E) and Kitchen(K). Each category contains
1000 positive and 1000 negative reviews. We con-
structed 12 cross-domain sentiment classification
tasks, one for each source-target domain pair, B2D,
B2E, B2K, D2B, D2E, D2K, E2B, E2D, E2K, K2B,
K2D, K2E. For example, the task B2D means that
we use the Books reviews as the source domain and
the DVD reviews as the target domain. For each pair
of domains, we built a vocabulary with both uni-
gram and bigram features extracted from all the doc-
uments of the two domains, and then represented
each review document as a feature vector with term
frequency values.
4.3.1 Experimental Results for Cross-Domain
Sentiment Classification
For each of the twelve cross-domain sentiment
classification tasks on Amazon product reviews, we
used all the source reviews as labeled data and ran-
domly selected 100 target reviews as labeled data
while treating the rest as unlabeled test data. For the
baseline method BOW, we used binary indicator val-
ues as features, which has been shown to work better
than the term-frequency features for sentiment clas-
sification tasks (Pang et al., 2002; Na et al., 2004).
For all the other representation learning based meth-
ods, we selected the dimension size of learned repre-
sentation according to the average results over 3 runs
on the B2D task. The dimension sizes selected for
the methods PLSA, FDLDA, SCL, CPSP, and SWC
are 10, 50, 50, 100 and 10, respectively.1
150 and 100 are also the suggested values for SCL (Blitzer
et al., 2007) and CPSP (Blitzer et al., 2011) respectively on this
cross-domain sentiment classification dataset.

We then repeated each experiment 10 times based
on different random selections of 100 labeled re-
views from the target domain to compare the six
methods on the twelve tasks. The average classifica-
tion results are reported in Table 2. We can see that
the PLSA and FDLDA methods do not show much
advantage over the baseline method BOW. CPSP
performs better than PLSA and BOW on many of
the twelve tasks, but with small advantages, while
SCL outperforms CPSP on most tasks. The proposed
method SWC however demonstrates a clear advan-
tage over all the other methods and produces the best
results on all the twelve tasks.
We also conducted sensitivity analysis over the
proposed approach regarding the number of clus-
ters on the twelve cross-domain sentiment classifi-
cation tasks, by testing a set of cluster number val-
ues m = {5, 10, 20, 50, 100}. The average results
are plotted in Figure 5. Similar as before, we can
see the proposed approach has stable performance
across the set of different cluster numbers. More-
over, these results also clearly show that domain
adaptation is not a symmetric process, as we can see
it is easier to conduct domain adaptation from the
source domain Books to the target domain Kitchen
(with an accuracy around 82%), but it is more diffi-
cult to make domain adaptation from the source do-
main Kitchen to the target domain Books (with an ac-

ment classification tasks. Each figure shows experimental results for three tasks with the same source domain.
curacy around 75%). It also shows that the degree of
relatedness of the two domains is an important factor
for the effectiveness of knowledge adaptation. For
example, one can see that it is much easier to con-
duct domain adaptation from Kitchen to Electronics
(with an accuracy around 84%) than from Kitchen to
Books (with an accuracy around 75%), as Kitchen is
more closely related to Electronics than Books.
4.3.2 Sentiment Classification Accuracy vs
Label Complexity in Target Domain
Similar as before, we tested the proposed ap-
proach using a set of different values s ?
{100, 200, 300, 400, 500} as the number of labeled
reviews from the target domain. For each given s
value, we conducted the comparison experiments us-
ing the same setting above. The average results are
reported in Figure 4. We can see that the perfor-
mance of each approach in general improves with
the increase of the number of labeled reviews from
the target domain. The proposed approach maintains
a clear advantage over all the other methods on all
the twelve tasks across different label complexities.
All those empirical results demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach for cross-domain
sentiment classification.
4.3.3 Illustration of the Word Clusters
Finally, we would also like to demonstrate the
hard word clusters produced by the proposed su-
pervised word clustering method. We assign a word
into the cluster it most likely belongs to according
to its soft clustering representation, such as c? =
argmaxc P (c|w,??). Table 3 presents the top repre-
sentative words (i.e., the most frequent words) of the
10 word clusters produced on the task of B2K. We
can see that the first three clusters (C1, C2, and C3)
contain words with positive sentiment polarity in
different degrees. The two clusters (C4 and C5) con-
tain words used to express the degree of opinions.
The next four clusters (C6, C7, C8, and C9) contain
content words related to Books or Kitchen. The last
cluster (C10) contains words of negative sentiment
polarity. These results demonstrate that the proposed
supervised word clustering can produce task mean-
ingful word clusters and hence label-informative la-
tent features, which justifies its effectiveness.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel supervised rep-
resentation learning method to tackle domain adap-
tation by inducing predictive latent features based
on supervised word clustering. With the soft word
clustering produced, we can transform all docu-
ments from the two domains into a unified low-
dimensional feature space for effective training of
cross-domain NLP prediction system. We conducted
extensive experiments on cross-domain document
categorization tasks on Reuters-21578 dataset and
cross-domain sentiment classification tasks on Ama-
zon product reviews. Our empirical results demon-
strated the efficacy of the proposed approach.
