Abstract
This paper offers an approach for governments
to harness the information contained in social
media in order to make public inspections and
disclosure more efficient. As a case study, we
turn to restaurant hygiene inspections – which
are done for restaurants throughout the United
States and in most of the world and are a fre-
quently cited example of public inspections
and disclosure. We present the first empiri-
cal study that shows the viability of statistical
models that learn the mapping between tex-
tual signals in restaurant reviews and the hy-
giene inspection records from the Department
of Public Health. The learned model achieves
over 82% accuracy in discriminating severe
offenders from places with no violation, and
provides insights into salient cues in reviews
that are indicative of the restaurant’s sanitary
conditions. Our study suggests that public
disclosure policy can be improved by mining
public opinions from social media to target in-
spections and to provide alternative forms of
disclosure to customers.
1 Introduction
Public health inspection records help customers to
be wary of restaurants that have violated health
codes. In some counties and cities, e.g., LA, NYC,
it is required for restaurants to post their inspec-
tion grades at their premises, which have shown
to affect the revenue of the business substantially
(e.g., Jin and Leslie (2005), Henson et al. (2006)),
thereby motivating restaurants to improve their sani-
tary practice. Other studies have reported correlation
between the frequency of unannounced inspections
per year, and the average violation scores, confirm-
ing the regulatory role of inspections in improving
the hygiene quality of the restaurants and decreasing
food-borne illness risks (e.g., Jin and Leslie (2003),
Jin and Leslie (2009), Filion and Powell (2009),
NYC-DoHMH (2012)).
However, one practical challenge in the current
inspection system is that the department of health
has only limited resources to dispatch inspectors,
leaving out a large number of restaurants with un-
known hygiene grades. We postulate that online re-
views written by the very citizens who have visited
those restaurants can serve as a proxy for predicting
the likely outcome of the health inspection of any
given restaurant. Such a prediction model can com-
plement the current inspection system by enlight-
ening the department of health to make a more in-
formed decision when allocating inspectors, and by
guiding customers when choosing restaurants.
Our work shares the spirit of recently emerging
studies that explores social media analysis for pub-
lic health surveillance, in particular, monitoring in-
fluenza or food-poisoning outbreaks from micro-
blogs (e.g., Aramaki et al. (2011), Sadilek et al.
(2012b), Sadilek et al. (2012a), Sadilek et al. (2013),
Lamb et al. (2013), Dredze et al. (2013), von Etter
et al. (2010)). However, no prior work has examined
the utility of review analysis as a predictive tool for
accessing hygiene of restaurants, perhaps because
the connection is not entirely conspicuous: after all,
customers are neither familiar with inspection codes,
nor have the full access to the kitchen, nor have been
asked to report on the hygiene aspects of their expe-

In this work, we report the first empirical study
demonstrating the utility of review analysis for pre-
dicting health inspections, achieving over 82% accu-
racy in discriminating severe offenders from places
with no violation, and find predictive cues in reviews
that correlate with the inspection results.
2 Data
We scraped entire reviews written for restaurants in
Seattle from Yelp over the period of 2006 to 2013.1
The inspection records of Seattle is publicly avail-
able at www.datakc.org. More than 50% of the
restaurants listed under Yelp did not have inspection
records, implying the limited coverage of inspec-
tions. We converted street addresses into canonical
forms when matching restaurants between Yelp and
inspection database. After integrating reviews with
inspection records, we obtained about 13k inspec-

Inspection Penalty Score Threshold
Figure 2: Spearman’s coefficients of factors & inspection
penalty scores. ‘*’: statistically significant (p ? 0.05)
tions over 1,756 restaurants with 152k reviews. For
each restaurant, there are typically several inspec-
tion records. We defined an “inspection period” of
each inspection record as the period of time start-
ing from the day after the previous inspection to the
day of the current inspection. If there is no previ-
ous inspection, then the period stretches to the past
6 months in time. Each inspection period corre-
sponds to an instance in the training or test set. We
merge all reviews within an inspection period into
one document when creating the feature vector.
Note that non-zero penalty scores may not nec-
essarily indicate alarming hygiene issues. For ex-
ample, violating codes such as “proper labeling” or
“proper consumer advisory posted for raw or under-
cooked foods” seem relatively minor, and unlikely to
be noted and mentioned by reviewers. Therefore, we
focus on restaurants with severe violations, as they
are exactly the set of restaurants that inspectors and
customers need to pay the most attention to. To de-
fine restaurants with ”severe violations” we experi-
ment with a varying threshold t, such that restaurants
with score ? t are labeled as “unhygienic”.2
3 Correlates of Inspection Penalty Scores
We examine correlation between penalty scores and
several statistics of reviews:
I. Volume of Reviews:
2For restaurants with “hygienic” labels, we only consider
those without violation, as there are enough number of such
restaurants to keep balanced distribution between two classes.

• count of all reviews
• average length of all reviews
II. Sentiment of Reviews: We examine whether
the overall sentiment of the customers correlates
with the hygiene of the restaurants based on follow-
ing measures:
• average review rating
• count of negative (? 3) reviews
III. Deceptiveness of Reviews: Restaurants with
bad hygiene status are more likely to attract negative
reviews, which would then motivate the restaurants
to solicit fake reviews. But it is also possible that
some of the most assiduous restaurants that abide
by health codes strictly are also diligent in solicit-
ing fake positive reviews. We therefore examine the
correlation between hygiene violations and the de-
gree of deception as follows.
• bimodal distribution of review ratings
The work of Feng et al. (2012) has shown
that the shape of the distribution of opinions,
overtly skewed bimodal distributions in partic-
ular, can be a telltale sign of deceptive review-
ing activities. We approximately measure this
by computing the variance of review ratings.
• volume of deceptive reviews based on linguistic
patterns
We also explore the use of deception classifiers
based on linguistic patterns (Ott et al., 2011)
to measure the degree of deception. Since no
deception corpus is available in the restaurant
domain, we collected a set of fake reviews and
truthful reviews (250 reviews for each class),
following Ott et al. (2011).3
310 fold cross validation on this dataset yields 79.2% accu-
racy based on unigram and bigram features.

Filtering Reviews: When computing above statis-
tics over the set of reviews corresponding to each
restaurant, we also consider removing a subset of re-
views that might be dubious or just noise. In partic-
ular, we remove reviews that are too far away (delta
? 2) from the average review rating. Another filter-
ing rule can be removing all reviews that are clas-
sified as deceptive by the deception classifier ex-
plained above. For brevity, we only show results
based on the first filtering rule, as we did not find
notable differences in different filtering strategies.
Results: Fig 1 and 2 show Spearman’s rank corre-
lation coefficient with respect to the statistics listed
above, with and without filtering, computed at dif-
ferent threshold cutoffs ? {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50} of
inspection scores. Although coefficients are not
strong,4 they are mostly statistically significant with
p ? 0.05 (marked with ’*’), and show interesting
contrastive trends as highlighted below.
In Fig 1, as expected, average review rating is neg-
atively correlated with the inspection penalty scores.
Interestingly, all three statistics corresponding to the
volume of customer reviews are positively corre-
lated with inspection penalty. What is more inter-
esting is that if potentially deceptive reviews are fil-
tered, then the correlation gets stronger, which sug-
gests the existence of deceptive reviews covering up
unhappy customers. Also notice that correlation is
4Spearman’s coefficient assumes monotonic correlation. We
suspect that the actual correlation of these factors and inspection
scores are not entirely monotonic.

generally stronger when higher cutoffs are used (x-
axis), as expected. Fig 2 looks at the relation be-
tween the deception level and the inspection scores
more directly. As suspected, restaurants with high
penalty scores show increased level of deceptive re-
views.
Although various correlates of hygiene scores ex-
amined so far are insightful, these alone are not in-
formative enough to be used as a predictive tool,
hence we explore content-based classification next.
4 Content-based Prediction
We examine the utility of the following features:
Features based on customers’ opinion:
1. Aggregated opinion: average review rating
2. Content of the reviews: unigram, bigram
Features based on restaurant’s metadata:
3. Cuisine: e.g., Thai, Italian, as listed under Yelp
4. Location: first 5 digits of zip code
5. Inspection History: a boolean feature (“hy-
gienic” or “unhygienic”), a numerical feature
(previous penalty score rescaled ? [0, 1]), a nu-
meric feature (average penalty score over all
previous inspections)
Hygienic:
Cooking Method & Garnish: brew, frosting, grill,
crush, crust, taco, burrito, toast
Healthy or Fancier Ingredients: celery, calamity,
wine, broccoli, salad, flatbread, olive, pesto
Cuisines : Breakfast, Fish & Chips, Fast Food,
German, Diner, Belgian, European, Sandwiches,
Vegetarian
Whom & When: date, weekend, our, husband,
evening, night
Sentiment: lovely, yummy, generous, friendly, great,
nice
Service & Atmosphere: selection, attitude,
atmosphere, ambiance, pretentious
Table 3: Lexical Cues & Examples - Hygienic (clean)
6. Review Count
7. Non-positive Review Count
Classification Results We use liblinear’s SVM
(Fan et al., 2008) with L1 regularization and 10 fold
cross validation. We filter reviews that are farther
than 2 from the average rating. We also run Sup-
port Vector Regression (SVR) using liblinear. Fig 3
shows the results. As we increase the threshold, the
accuracy also goes up in most cases. Table 1 shows
feature ablation at threshold t = 50, and ‘*’ denotes
statistically significant (p?0.05) difference over the
performance with all features based on student t-test.
We find that metadata information of restaurants
such as location and cuisine alone show good predic-
tive power, both above 66%, which are significantly
higher than the expected accuracy of random guess-
ing (50%).
Somewhat unexpected outcome is aggregated
opinion, which is the average review rating during
the corresponding inspection period, as it performs
not much better than chance (57.52%). This result
suggest that the task of hygiene prediction from re-
views differs from the task of sentiment classifica-
tion of reviews.
Interestingly, the inspection history feature alone
is highly informative, reaching accuracy upto 72%,
suggesting that the past performance is a good pre-
dictor of the future performance.
Textual content of the reviews (unigram+bigram)
turns out to be the most effective features, reaching
upto 82.68% accuracy. Lastly, when all the features
1446
are combined together, the performance decreases
slightly to 81.37%, perhaps because n-gram features
perform drastically better than all others.
4.1 Insightful Cues
Table 2 and 3 shows representative lexical cues for
each class with example sentences excerpted from
actual reviews when context can be helpful.
Hygiene: Interestingly, hygiene related words are
overwhelmingly negative, e.g., “gross”, “mess”,
“sticky”. What this suggests is that reviewers do
complain when the restaurants are noticeably dirty,
but do not seem to feel the need to complement on
cleanliness as often. Instead, they seem to focus on
other positive aspects of their experience, e.g., de-
tails of food, atmosphere, and their social occasions.
Service and Atmosphere: Discriminative fea-
tures reveal that it is not just the hygiene related
words that are predictive of the inspection results of
restaurants. It turns out that there are other quali-
ties of restaurants, such as service and atmosphere,
that also correlate with the likely outcome of inspec-
tions. For example, when reviewers feel the need
to talk about “door”, “student”, “sticker”, or “the
size” (see Table 2 and 3), one can extrapolate that
the overall experience probably was not glorious. In
contrast, words such as “selection”, “atmosphere”,
“ambiance” are predictive of hygienic restaurants,
even including those with slightly negative connota-
tion such as “attitude” or “pretentious”.
Whom and When: If reviewers talk about details
of their social occasions such as “date”, “husband”,
it seems to be a good sign.
The way food items are described: Another in-
teresting aspect of discriminative words are the way
food items are described by reviewers. In general,
mentions of basic ingredients of dishes, e.g., “noo-
dle”, “egg”, “soy” do not seem like a good sign. In
contrast, words that help describing the way dish is
prepared or decorated, e.g., “grill”, “toast”, “frost-
ing”, “bento box” “sugar” (as in “sugar coated”)
are good signs of satisfied customers.
Cuisines: Finally, cuisines have clear correlations
with inspection outcome, as shown in Table 2 and 3.
5 Related Work
There have been several recent studies that probe the
viability of public health surveillance by measuring
relevant textual signals in social media, in particu-
lar, micro-blogs (e.g., Aramaki et al. (2011), Sadilek
et al. (2012b), Sadilek et al. (2012a), Sadilek et al.
(2013), Lamb et al. (2013), Dredze et al. (2013), von
Etter et al. (2010)). Our work joins this line of re-
search but differs in two distinct ways. First, most
prior work aims to monitor a specific illness, e.g.,
influenza or food-poisoning by paying attention to
a relatively small set of keywords that are directly
relevant to the corresponding sickness. In contrast,
we examine all words people use in online reviews,
and draw insights on correlating terms and concepts
that may not seem immediately relevant to the hy-
giene status of restaurants, but nonetheless are pre-
dictive of the outcome of the inspections. Second,
our work is the first to examine online reviews in the
context of improving public policy, suggesting addi-
tional source of information for public policy mak-
ers to pay attention to.
Our work draws from the rich body of research
that studies online reviews for sentiment analysis
(e.g., Pang and Lee (2008)) and deception detec-
tion (e.g., Mihalcea and Strapparava (2009), Ott et
al. (2011), Feng et al. (2012)), while introducing
the new task of public hygiene prediction. We ex-
pect that previous studies for aspect-based sentiment
analysis (e.g., Titov and McDonald (2008), Brody
and Elhadad (2010), Wang et al. (2010)) would be a
fruitful venue for further investigation.
6 Conclusion
We have reported the first empirical study demon-
strating the promise of review analysis for predicting
health inspections, introducing a task that has poten-
tially significant societal benefits, while being rele-
vant to much research in NLP for opinion analysis
based on customer reviews.
