Abstract
This research note describes the early stages of a project
to enhance a monolingual English dictionary database
as a resource for computational applications. It consid-
ers some of the issues involved in deriving formal lexi-
cal data from a natural-language dictionary.
1 Introduction
The goal of the project is to enhance the database
of the Oxford Dictionary of English (a forthcoming
new edition of the 1998 New Oxford Dictionary of
English) so that it contains not only the original
dictionary content but also additional sets of data
formalizing, codifying, and supplementing this
content. This will allow the dictionary to be ex-
ploited effectively as a resource for computational
applications.
The Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE) is a
high-level dictionary intended for fluent English
speakers (especially native speakers) rather than
for learners. Hence its coverage is very extensive,
and definitional detail is very rich. By the same
token, however, a certain level of knowledge is
assumed on the part of the reader, so not every-
thing is spelled out explicitly. For example, ODE
frequently omits morphology and variation which
is either regular or inferable from related words.
Entry structure and defining style, while mostly
conforming broadly to a small set of basic patterns
and formulae, may often be more concerned with
detail and accuracy than with simplicity of expla-
nation. Such features make the ODE content rela-
tively difficult to convert into comprehensive and
formalized data. Nevertheless, the richness of the
ODE text, particularly in the frequent use of exam-
ple sentences, provides a wealth of cues and clues
which can help to control the generation of more
formal lexical data.
A basic principle of this work is that the en-
hanced data should always be predicated on the
original dictionary content, and not the other way
round. There has been no attempt to alter the origi-
nal content in order to facilitate the generation of
formal data. The enhanced data is intended primar-
ily to constitute a formalism which closely reflects,
summarizes, or extrapolates from the existing dic-
tionary content.
The following sections list some of the data types
that are currently in progress:
2 Morphology
A fundamental building block for formal lexical
data is the creation of a complete morphological
formalism (verb inflections, noun plurals, etc.)
covering all lemmas (headwords, derivatives, and
compounds) and their variant forms, and encoding
relationships between them. This is being done
largely automatically, assuming regular patterns as
a default but collecting and acting on anything in
the entry which may indicate exceptions (explicit
grammatical information, example sentences,
pointers to other entries, etc.).
The original intention was to generate a morpho-
logical formalism which reflected whatever was
stated or implied by the original dictionary content.
Hence pre-existing morphological lexicons were
not used except when an ambiguous case needed to
be resolved. As far as possible, issues relating to
the morphology of a word were to be handled by
collecting evidence internal to its dictionary entry.
However, it became apparent that there were
some key areas where this approach would fall
short. For example, there are often no conclusive
indicators as to whether or not a noun may be plu-
123
ralized, or whether or not an adjective may take a
comparative or superlative. In such cases, any
available clues are collected from the entry but are
then weighted by testing possible forms against a
corpus.
3 Idioms and other phrases
Phrases and phrasal verbs are generally lemma-
tized in an 'idealized' form which may not repre-
sent actual occurrences. Variation and alternative
wording is embedded parenthetically in the lemma:
(as) nice (or sweet) as pie
Objects, pronouns, etc., which may form part of
the phrase are indicated in the lemma by words
such as 'someone', 'something', 'one':
twist (or wind or wrap) someone around
one's little finger
In order to be able to match such phrases to real-
world occurrences, each dictionary lemma was
extended as a series of strings which enumerate
each possible variant and codify how pronouns,
noun phrases, etc., may be interpolated. Each oc-
currence of a verb in these strings is linked to the
morphological data in the verb's own entry, to en-
sure that inflected forms of a phrase (e.g. 'she had
him wrapped around her little finger') can be iden-
tified.
4 Semantic classification
We are seeking to classify all noun senses in the
dictionary according to a semantic taxonomy,
loosely inspired by the Princeton WordNet project.
Initially, a relatively small number of senses were
classified manually. Statistical data was then gen-
erated by examining the definitions of these senses.
This established a definitional 'profile' for each
classification, which was then used to automati-
cally classify further senses. Applied iteratively,
this process succeeded in classifying all noun
senses in a relatively coarse-grained way, and is
now being used to further refine the granularity of
the taxonomy and to resolve anomalies.
Definitional profiling here involves two ele-
ments:
The first element is the identification of the 'key
term' in the definition. This is the most significant
noun in the definition — not a rigorously defined
concept, but one which has proved pragmatically
effective. It is not always coterminous with the
genus term; for example, in a definition beginning
'a morsel of food which...', the 'key term' is taken
to be food rather than morsel.
The second element is a scoring of all the other
meaningful vocabulary in the definition (i.e. ignor-
ing articles, conjunctions, etc.). A simple weight-
ing scheme is used to give slightly more
importance to words at the beginning of a defini-
tion (e.g. a modifier of the key term) than to words
at the end.
These two elements are then assigned mutual in-
formation scores in relation to each possible classi-
fication, and the two MI scores are combined in
order to give an overall score. This overall score is
taken to be a measure of how 'typical' a given defi-
nition would be for each possible classification.
This enables one very readily to rank and group all
the senses for a given classification, thus exposing
misclassifications or points where a classification
needs to be broken down into subcategories.
The semantic taxonomy currently has about
1250 'nodes' (each representing a classification
category) on up to 10 levels. The dictionary con-
tains 95,000 defmed noun senses in total, so there
are on average 76 senses per node. However, this
average disguises the fact that there are a small
number of nodes which classify significantly larger
sets of senses. Further subcategorization of large
sets is desirable in principle, but is not considered a
priority in all cases. For example, there are several
hundred senses classified simply as tree; the effort
involved in subcategorizing these into various tree
species is unlikely to pay dividends in terms of
value for normal NLP applications. A pragmatic
approach is therefore to deprioritize work on ho-
mogeneous sets (sets where the range of 'typicality'
scores for each sense is relatively small), more or
less irrespective of set size.
Hence the goal is not achieve granularity on the
order of WordNet's 'synset' (a set in which all
terms are synonymous, and hence are rarely more
than four or five in number) but rather a somewhat
more coarse-grained 'sirnilarset' in which every
sense is similar enough to support general-purpose
word-sense disambiguation, document retrieval,
and other standard NLP tasks. At this level, auto-
124
matic analysis and grading of defmitions is proving
highly productive in establishing classification
schemes and in monitoring consistency, although
extensive supervision and manual correction is still
required.
It should be noted that a significant number of
nouns and noun senses in ODE do not have defini-
tions and are therefore opaque to such processes.
Firstly, some senses cross-refer to other defini-
tions; secondly, derivatives are treated in ODE as
undefined subentries. Classification of these will
be deferred until classification of all defmed senses
is complete. It should then be possible to classify
most of the remainder semi-automatically, by
combining an analysis of word formation with an
analysis of target or 'parent' senses.
5 Domain indicators
Using a set of about 200 subject areas (biochemis-
try, soccer, architecture, astronomy, etc.), all rele-
vant senses and lemmas in ODE are being
populated with markers indicating the subject do-
main o which they relate. It is anticipated that this
will support the extraction of specialist lexicons,
and will allow the ODE database to function as a
resource for document classification and similar
applications.
As with semantic classification above, a number
of domain indicators were assigned manually, and
these were then used iteratively to seed assignment
of further indicators to statistically similar defini-
tions. Automatic assignment is a little more
straightforward and robust here, since most of the
time the occurrence of strongly-typed vocabulary
will be a sufficient cue, and there is little reason to
identify a key term or otherwise parse the defini-
tion.
Similarly, assignment to undefined items (e.g.
derivatives) is simpler, since for most two- or
three-sense entries a derivative can simply inherit
any domain indicators of the senses of its 'parent'
entry. For longer entries this process has to be
checked manually, since the derivative may not
relate to all the senses of the parent.
Currently, about 72,000 of a total 206,000
senses and lemmas have been assigned domain
indicators. There is no clearly-defined cut-off point
for iterations of the automatic assignment process;
each iteration will continue to capture senses
which are less and less strongly related to the do-
main. Beyond a certain point, the relationship will
become too tenuous to be of much use in most con-
texts; but that point will differ for each subject
field (and for each context). Hence a further objec-
tive is to implement a 'points' system which not
only classifies a sense by domain but also scores
its relevance to that domain.
6 Collocates for senses
We are currently exploring methods to automati-
cally determine key collocates for each sense of
multi-sense entries, to assist in applications involv-
ing word-sense disambiguation. Since collocates
were not given explicitly in the original dictionary
content of ODE, the task involves examining all
available elements of a sense for clues which may
point to collocational patterns.
The most fruitful areas in this respect are firstly
definition patterns, and secondly example sen-
tences.
Definition patterns are best illustrated by verbs,
where likely subjects and or objects are often indi-
cated in parentheses:
fly: (of a bird, bat, or insect) move through the
air...
impound: (of a dam) hold back (water)...
The terms in parentheses can be collected as possi-
ble collocates, and in some cases can be used as
seeds for the generation of longer lists (by exploit-
ing the semantic classifications described in sec-
tion 3 above). Similar constructions are often
found in adjective definitions. For other parts of
speech (e.g. nouns), and for definitions which hap-
pen not to use the parenthetic style, inference of
likely collocates from definition text is a less
straightforward process; however, by identifying a
set of characteristic constructions it is possible to
define search patterns that will locate collocate-like
elements in a large number of definitions. The de-
fining style in ODE is regular enough to support
this approach with some success.
Some notable 'blind spots' have emerged, often
reflecting ODE's original editorial agenda; for
example, the defining style used for verbs often
makes it hard to determine automatically whether a
sense is transitive or intransitive.
Example sentences can be useful sources since
they were chosen principally for their typicality,
125
and are therefore very likely to contain one or
more high-scoring collocates for a given sense.
The key problem is to identify automatically which
words in the sentence represent collocates, as op-
posed to those words which are merely incidental.
Syntactic patterns can help here; if looking for col-
locates for a noun, for example, it makes sense to
collect any modifiers of the word in question, and
any words participating in prepositional construc-
tions. Thus if a sense of the entry for breach has
the example sentence
She was guilty of a breach of trust.
then some simple parsing and pattern-matching can
collect guilty and trust as possible collocates.
However, it will be apparent from this that ex-
amination of the content of a sense can do no more
than build up lists of candidate collocates — a
number of which will be genuinely high-scoring
collocates, but others of which may be more or less
arbitrary consequences of an editorial decision.
The second step will therefore be to build into the
process a means of testing each candidate against a
corpus-based list of collocates, in order to elimi-
nate the arbitrary items and to extend the list that
remains
7 Conclusion
In order for a non-formalized, natural-language
dictionary like ODE to become properly accessible
to computational processing, the dictionary content
must be positioned within a formalism which ex-
plicitly enumerates and classifies all the informa-
tion that the dictionary content itself merely
assumes, implies, or refers to. Such a system can
then serve as a means of entry to the original dic-
tionary content, enabling a software application to
quickly and reliably locate relevant material, and
guiding interpretation.
The process of automatically generating such a
formalism by examining the original dictionary
content requires a great deal of manual supervision
and ad hoc correction at all stages. Nevertheless,
the process demonstrates the richness of a large
natural-language dictionary in providing cues and
flagging exceptions. The stylistic regularity of a
dictionary like ODE supports the enumeration of a
finite (albeit large) list of structures and patterns
which can be matched against a given entry or en-
try element in order to classify it, mine it for perti-
nent information, and note instances which may be
anomalous.
The formal lexical data is being built up along-
side the original dictionary content in a single inte-
grated database. This arrangement supports a broad
range of possible uses. Elements of the formal data
can be used on their own, ignoring the original dic-
tionary content. More interestingly, the formal data
can be used in conjunction with the original dic-
tionary content, enabling an application to exploit
the rich detail of natural-language lexicography
while using the formalism to orient itself reliably.
The formal data can then be regarded not so much
as a stripped-down counterpart to the main diction-
ary content, but more as a bridge across which ap-
plications can productively access that content.
