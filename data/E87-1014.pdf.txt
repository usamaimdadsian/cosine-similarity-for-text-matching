ABSTRACT 4. 
An automatic speech recognition system for Italian 
language has been developed at IBM Italy Scientific Center 
in Rome. It is able to recognize in real time natural 
language sentences, composed with words from a dictionary 
of 6500 items, dictated by a speaker with short pauses 
among them. The system is speaker dependent, before 
using it the speaker has to perform the training stage 
reading a predefined text 15-20 minutes long. It runs on an 
architecture composed by an IBM 3090 mainframe and a 
PC/AT based workstation with signal processing 
equipments. 
PROBABIL IST IC  APPROACH 
The problem of recognizing human voice is approached 
in a probabilistic manner. I_~t W = w 1, w 2 . . . . .  w n be a 
sequence of n words, and let A be the acoustic information 
extracted from the speech signal, from which the system will 
try to identify the pronounced words. P (WI~)  i...ndieates the 
probability that the the sequence of words W has been 
spoken, once we observe the acoustic string A" produced at 
the end of the signal processing stage. The most probable 
sequence of word, given A- , is that maximizing /'(W'IA') • 
Through Bayes' formul~

P_.~.A J W) denotes the probability that the se__quence of words 
W will produce the acoustic s t r ing j ' ,  P(W) is the a priori 
probability of word string W, P(A) is the probability of 
acoustic string A. To find the word sequence which 
maximizes the third term in the preceding equation, it is 
sufficient to find the sequence which maximizes the 
numerator; P(A) is, in fact, clearly not dependent on any 
W. Then, the recognition task can be decomposed in these 
problems: 
1. perform an acoustic processing able to extract from the 
speech signal an information A representative of its 
acoustic features, and, at the same time, adequate for a 
statistical analysis; 
3. 
create an acoustic model which makes it possible to 
evaluate P(A'\[ W-~_), that is the probability that the 
acoustic string A will be produced when the speaker 
pronounces the word string W; 
create a language model giving the prob._ability P(IV) 
that the speaker will wish to pronounce W; 
find, among all possible sequences of words, the most 
probable or,e. F, ven with small vocabularies it is not 
feasible to ~.onduct an exhaustive search; so, we need to 
identify an efficient search strategy. 
ACOUSTIC  PROCESSING 
Acoustic processing is performed in the acoustic 
front-end forrned by an acquisition stage (microphone, filter, 
amplifier, A~I) converter) and a processing stage. The 
analog to digital converter gives a numeric representation f 
the signal picked up by the microphone, constituted by 
20000 samples/see., each of 12 bits. Every 10 milliseconds 
an acoustic vector of 20 parameters i computed escribing, 
through its spectral features, the behavior of speech signal 
for that interval. This operation takes into account recent 
studies on physiology of the human ear and on psychology 
of sound,, perccption. The signal energy in several frequency 
bands is determined through a Fourier analysis 161. Width 
of bands is n~}l uniform; it grows with frequency. This is in 
accordance with the behavior of the cochlea that has a 
better resolution power at low frequencies. Furthermore, 
compulation of parameters considers other features of 
auditory system, as dynamic adaptation to signal level. 
Each acoustic vector is then compared with a set of 200 
prototype vectors and the closest prototype is chosen to 
represent i ; the label of this prototype (a number from I to 
200), will then be substituted to th__e original vector. 
Therefore, the acoustic information ,4 is formed by a 
sequence of labels a l ,  a2,"" , with a considerable reduction 
in the amount of data needed to represent the speech signal. 
ACOUSI" IC  MODEl. ,  
The acoustic model must compute the probability 
P(A IW) that lhe pronunciation of word string I,V will 
produce the hd~el string A. To design the acoustic model it 
is esscnlial t-  understand the relationship between words 
and sounds of a language. With sounds of a language we 
mean those particular sounds usually generated during 
speaking. Ph(~netics is helpful in this task. Experts in 
linguistics usually classify sounds in classes, called phonemex 
\[2\]. The same phoneme can be representative of many 
different sounds, but they are completely equivalent from a 
linguistic point of view. The Italian language is usually 
described with 31 phonemes; in our system we use an 
extended set composed of 56 phonetic elements, to take into 
account particular aspects of the process of pronunciation 
not considered by the usual classification: coarticulation, 
different behavior in stressed and non-stressed vowels, 
pronunciation of w~wels and fricatives by people from 
different regi(ms. F, ach word in the language can be 
phonetically described by a sequence of phonemes, 
80 
representing the sequence of basic sounds that compose it. 
So, it is very useful to build up the acoustic model starting 
from phonemes. 
For each phoneme, a Markov source i"51 is defined, 
which is a model representing the phenomenon of producing 
acoustic labels during pronunciation of the phoneme itself. 
Markov sources can be represented by a set of states and a 
set of transitions among them. Every 10 milliseconds a
transition takes place and an acoustic label is generated by 
the source. Transitions and labels are not predetermined, 
but are chosen randomly on the basis of a probability 
distribution. Starting from phoneme models, we can build 
models for words, or for word strings, simply by 
concatenating the Markov sources of the corresponding 
phonemes. Figure 1 shows a typical structure for Markov 
model of a phonetic unit and figure 2 the structure of the 
Markov model for a word. 
The structure of Markov models is completely defined 
by the number of states and by interconneetions among 
them. It is unique for all the phonemes and for all the 
speakers and has been determined on the basis of intuitive 
considerations and experimental results, because no 
algorithm is known to find the best structure to describe 
such a phenomenon. The different behavior in different 
phonemes and in the voice of different speakers is taken into 
account in the evaluation of the model parameters: 
probability of transition between pair of states and 
probability of emission of labels. This evaluation, executed 
inthe training stage, is performed, given the word sequenc~ ~_ 
If: of training text and collected the acoustic label string A 
from the front-end, accordingly to the maximum likelihood 
criterion \[l-I, maximizing the probability P(A't W). A 
speaker, during training, does not have to pronounce all the 
words in the dictionary; on the other hand, it is necessary 
that the text to be read contains all the phonemes of the 
language, each of them well represented in a great variety of 
phonetic ontexts. 
in the recognition stage the term P(A'I W) is computed 
on the basis of statistical parameters determined uring the 
training; then it is necessary to evaluate the probability that 
the Mar._kov source for the word string W will emit the label 
string A, going from its initial state to its final one. This 
must be done summing the probability of all the paths of 
this kind, but it could be eomputationally very heavy and 
impractical to count them all because._their number depends 
exponentially on the length of A. Using dynamic 
programming techniques, it is possible to reach this goal 
limiting the amount of calculation to be done. The forward 
pass algorithm 1"5\], is, in._ fact, computationally linearly 
dependent on the length of A. 
LANGUAGE MODEL 
__The language model is used to evaluate the probability 
P(W) of the word sequence m. Let I/l = Wl, w2, ... , w n ; 
P(W) can be computed as: 
tl 
ef t ) - -  1--\[p(w, I w~_t ..... wl) 
k=l  
Figure I. Typical s t ructure  for Markov  model of  a 
phonetic unit. 
So, tbe task of the language model is to calculate 
P(WklWk.  I . . . . .  Wl) , that is, given the beginning of a 
sentence Wl, w 2 .... , Wk_ 1 , to evaluate the probability of 
words in the vocabulary to be at place k in the sentence, or, 
in other terms, to estimate the probability of the word to 
appear in that context. 
if we ignore the language model (that means 
considering words as equiprobable), it would be impossible 
to distinguish omophones, (acoustically equivalent words), 
and it would be very hard to recognize correctly very similar 
words on the basis of the acoustic information only. The 
estimation of probabilities could be based on grammatical 
and semantic information, but a practical and easy way to 
use this approach has not been found yet. For this reason, 
in our approach the language model is built up from the 
analysis of statistical data. They have been collected from a 
huge set (corpus) of Italian sentences (in all, about 6 millions 
of words). Even using a small dictionary, no corpus can 
contain all the possible contexts Wi_l, w i .2 , . . . ,  w 1 . The 
evaluation of the term 
P(W)= 1--\[P(w~ I w,._ t . . . . .  wt) 
is then based on the intuitive consideration that recently 
spoken words in a sentence have more influence than old 
ones on the continuation of the sentence itself. In 
particular, we consider the probability of a word in a 
context depending only on the two preceding words in the 
sentence:  
l ' (wk l  w~ I, "'t, ,_ . . . . .  wO= P(wklwk-t, Wk-2) 
Such a model it called trigram language model. It is based 
on a very simple idea and, for this reason, its statistics can 
be built very easily only counting all the sequences of three 
consecutive words present in the corpus. On the other 
band, its predictive power is very high. i f  the information 
given by the language model were not available, in every 
context there would be uncertainty about the next word 
among all the 6500 words in the dictionary. Using the 
trigram model, uncertainty is, on the average, reduced to the

choice of a word among 100-110. In the procedure of 
estimating the language model statistics, a problem comes 
out: the probability of trigrams never observed in the 
corpus must be evaluated. For a 6500-word dictionary the 
number of different rigrams is about 270 billions; but from 
a corpus of 6 millions of words, only 6 millions of trigrams 
can be extracted, and not all of them are different. It is 
clearly evident that, even with the availability of a bigger 
corpus, it is not possible to estimate probabilities of 
trigrams by their relative frequencies. Trigrams never seen 
in the corpus must be considered allowable, although not 
very probable, otherwise it could be impossible to recognize 
a sentence containing one of them. To overcome this 
problem, some techniques have been developed, giving a 
good estimate of probability of never observed events \[3\]. 
Sentences in the corpus are taken from economy and 
finance magazines, and, as a consequence, the model is 
capable to work well on phrases about this topic, worse on 
other subjects. Clearly, the availability of corpus on different 
topics could be very useful in order to use the language 
model in different contexts. Nevertheless, some studies 
demonstrate that language model could be still fruitfully 
used for a matter different o the main one, if the collected 
data are enriched with a small corpus (about 1-2% the 
dimension of the main one) related to the new subject. This 
technique is used to allow the recognition of sentences not 
on finance and economy. 
Figure 3 shows the coverage of the corpus on texts of 
economy and finance as a function of the vocabulary size. 
SEARCH STRATEGY 
To find the word sequence W which maximizes the 
term P(WIA)  , it is not feasible to consider all the 
sequences that can be built with words in the dictionary. 
For this reason an efficient search strategy is used that limits 
the investigation to a small fraction of the allowed word 
strings. The sequences generable with the N words in the 
dictionary can be represented by a tree. N branches, 
corresponding to the first word in the sentence, go out From 
the root, one For each word in the dictionary. Each branch 
ends in a new node, From which other N branches are 
generated for the second word in the sentence, and so on. 
A node in the tree defines univocally a sequence of words, 
constituted by words corresponding to branches in the path 
from the root to tile node itself. During the recognition 
process, tree nodes are explored, and, for each of them, the 
probability (ac(~ustical nd linguistical) that the sentence will 
start with the corresponding words is computed. Nodes 
with a low probability are discarded; among the remaining 
nodes, the path that seems, so Far, the more probable is 
extended. This choice can be modified during the process, 
selecting at any time the best current path. This strategy, 
usually called slack sequential decoding, leads, in general, to 
the requested solution: the most probable sentence \[4\]. 
The extension of a path from a node is done analyzing 
all the branches going out From it, that means all the words 
in the vocabulary. It is computationally not practical to 
determine the acoustic likelihood of each word through the 
forward pass algorithm. The problem of a Fast access to a 
great dictionary is one of the most important topics in

speech recognition. Studies are conducted to find good 
strategies. In our system, first a rough match is rapidly 
conducted on the whole dictionary to select a subset of 
words. Then, a more precise search is performed on this 
subset with forward pass. It has been seen that this 
procedure assures most of the times the identification of the 
most acoustically ikely word. 
The stack decoding algorithm conducts a left to right 
search from the beginning to the end of the sentence, 
examining labels in the order they are produced by the 
acoustic front-end and it does not require in advance the 
knowledge of the whole label string. Therefore, it is well 
suited to operate in real time. 
The search in the tree of all the possible solutions, along 
with the computation of acoustical and linguistical 
probabilities, is performed in the IBM 3090 mainframe. This

RESULTS 
Several experiments were conducted on the recognition 
system with ten different speakers who had previously 
trained the system. Each speaker dictated a text composed 
by natural anguage sentences about finance and economy. 
Recognition accuracy is always over 94%, and, on the 
average is 96%. It has been seen that the language model is 
capable to avoid about 10% of the errors made using only 
the acoustic model. This shows the importance of using of 
linguistic information.
