Abst rac t  
We empirically show that there are significant differ- 
ences between the discourse structure of Japanese 
texts and the discourse structure of their corre- 
sponding English translations. To improve trans- 
lation quality, we propose a computational model 
for rewriting discourse structures. When we train 
our model on a parallel corpus of manually built 
Japanese and English discourse structure trees, we 
learn to rewrite Japanese trees as trees that are 
closer to the natural English rendering than the orig- 
inal ones. 
1 Mot ivat ion  
Almost all current MT systems process text one sen- 
tence at a time. Because of this limited focus, MT 
systems cannot re-group and re-order the clauses 
and sentences of an input text to achieve the most 
natural rendering in a target language. Yet, even 
between languages as close as English and French, 
there is a 10% mismatch in number of sentences 
- -  what is said in two sentences in one language 
is said in only one, or in three, in the other (Gale 
and Church, 1993). For distant language pairs, such 
as Japanese and English, the differences are more 
significant. 
Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (1), a 
word-by-word "gloss" of it (2), and a two-sentence 
translation of it that was produced by a professional 
translator (3). 
(1) 
\[The Ministry of Health and Welfare last year 
revealed I \] \[population of future estimate ac- 
cording to 2\] \[in future 1.499 persons as the 
lowest s\] \[that after *SAB* rising to turn that 4\] 
\[*they* estimated but s \] \[already the estimate 
misses a point ~\] \[prediction became. 7\] 
(2) 
\[In its future population estimates'\] \[made (3) 
public last year, 2\] \[the Ministry of Health and 
Welfare predicted that the SAB would drop to 
a new low of 1.499 in the future, s) \[but would 
make a comeback after that, 4\] \[increasing once 
again, s\] \[However, it looks as if that prediction 
will be quickly shattered. 6\] 
The labeled spans of text represent elementary 
discourse units (edus), i.e., minimal text spans that 
have an unambiguous discourse function (Mann and 
Thompson, 1988). If we analyze the text frag- 
ments closely, we will notice that in translating sen- 
tence (1), a professional translator chose to realize 
the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in 
text (1) corresponds roughly to unit 1 in text (3)); 
to realize then some of the information in Japanese 
unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (1) corresponds to unit 
2 in text (3)); to fuse then information given in units 
1, 3, and 5 in text (1) and realize it in English as 
unit 3; and so on. Also, the translator chose to re- 
package the information in the original Japanese sen- 
tence into two English sentences. 
At the elementary unit level, the correspondence 
between Japanese sentence (1) and its English trans- 
lation (3) can be represented as in (4}, where j C e 
denotes the fact that the semantic ontent of unit 
j is realized fully in unit e; j D e denotes the fact 
that the semantic ontent of unit e is realized fully 
in unit j; j = e denotes the fact that units j and e 
are semantically equivalent; and j ~ e denotes the 
fact that there is a semantic overlap between units j 
and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equiv- 
alence.

Figure 1: The discourse structures of texts (1) and (3). 
Hence. the mappings in (4) provide all explicit 
representation of the way information is re-ordered 
and re-packaged when translated from Japanese into 
English. However, when translat ing text, it is also 
the case that t he rhetorical rendering changes. What  
is realized ill Japanese using an CONTRAST relation 
can be realized in English using, for example, a COXl- 
PARISON or  a CONCESSION relation. 
Figure I presents in the style of Mann and Thomp-  
son (1988) the discourse structures of text frag- 
ments (1) and (3), Each discourse structure is a 
tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose 
internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans. 
Each node is characterized by a s tatus  (NUCLEUS or 
SATELLITE) and a rhetor ica l  re lat ion,  which is a re- 
lation that holds between two non-overlapping text 
spans. The distinction between nuclei and satellites 
comes from the empirical observation that the nu- 
cleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's 
intention than the satellite: and that the nucleus of 
a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent 
of tile satellite, but not vice versa. When spans are 
equally important ,  the relation is nmltinuclear: for 
example,  the CONTRAST relation that holds between 
unit \[3\] and span \[4.5\] in the rhetorical structure of 
the English text in figure 1 is nmhinuclear.  Rhetor- 
ical relations that end in the suffix "'-e'" denote re- 
lations that correspond to embedded syntactic con- 
stituents. For example, the ELABORATION-OBJECT- 
ATTRIBUTE-E relation that holds between units 2 
and 1 in the English discourse structure corresponds 
to a restrictive relative. 
If one knows the mappings at the edu level, 
one can determine the mappings at the span (dis- 
course constituent) level as well. For example, us- 
ing the elementary mappings in (4), one call deter- 
mine that Japanese span \[1,2\] corresponds to English 
span \[I,2\], Japanese unit \[4\] to English span \[4,5\], 
Japanese span \[6.7\] to English unit \[6\], Japanese 
span \[1.5\] to English span \[1.5\], and so on. As Fig- 
ure 1 shows, the CONCESSION relation that holds be- 
tween spans \[1,5\] and \[6,7\] in the Japanese tree corre- 
sponds to a similar relation that. holds between span 
\[1,5\] and unit \[6\] in the English tree (modulo the fact 
that,  in Japanese, the relation holds between sen- 
t ence fragments, while in English it holds between 
full sentences). However, the TEMPORAL-AFTER re- 
lation that holds between units \[:3\] and \[4\] ill the 
Japanese tree is realized as a CONTRAST relation 
between unit \[3\] and span \[4.5\] in the English tree. 
And because Japanese units \[6\] and \[7\] are fused 
into unit \[6\] in English, the relation ELABORATION- 
OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is 11o longer made explicit in 
the English text. 
Some of the differences between the two discourse 
trees in Figure 1 have been tradit ionally addressed

Table 1: Tagging reliability 
in MT systems at the syntactic level. For exam- 
ple, the re-ordering of units 1 and 2, can be dealt 
with using only syntactic models. However, as we 
will see in Section 2, there are significant differences 
between Japanese and English with respect to the 
way information is packaged and organized rhetori- 
cally not only at the sentence level, but also, at the 
paragraph and text levels. More specifically, as hu- 
mans translate Japanese into English, they re-order 
the clauses, sentences, and paragraphs of Japanese 
texts, they re-package the information into clauses, 
sentences, and paragraphs that are not a one-to-one 
mapping of the original Japanese units, and they 
rhetorically re-organize the structure of the trans- 
lated text so as to reflect rhetorical constraints pe- 
cific to English. If a translation system is to produce 
text that is not only grammatical but also coherent, 
it will have to ensure that the discourse structure of 
the target text reflects the natural renderings of the 
target language, and not that of the source language. 
In Section 2, we empirically show that there are 
significant differences between the rhetorical struc- 
ture of Japanese texts and their corresponding En- 
glish translations. These differences justify our in- 
vestigation into developing computational models 
for discourse structure rewriting. In Section 3, we 
present such a rewriting model, which re-orders the 
edus of the original text, determines English-specific 
clause, sentence, and paragraph boundaries, and re- 
builds the Japanese discourse structure of a text us- 
ing English-specific rhetorical renderings. In Sec- 
tion 4, we evaluate the performance of an imple- 
mentation of this model. We end with a discussion. 
2 Experiment 
In order to assess the role of discourse structure in 
MT, we built manually a corpus of discourse trees 
for 40 Japanese texts and their corresponding trans- 
lations. The texts were selected randomly from the 
ARPA corpus (White and O'Connell, 1994). On av- 
erage, each text had about 460 words. The Japanese 
texts had a total of 335 paragraphs and 773 sen- 
tences. The English texts had a total of 337 para- 
graphs and 827 sentences. 
We developed a discourse annotation protocol for 
Japanese and English along the lines followed by 
Marcu et al. (1999). We used Marcu's discourse an- 
notation tool (1999) in order to manually construct 
the discourse structure of all Japanese and English 
texts in the corpus. 10% of the Japanese and En- 
glish texts were rhetorically labeled by two of us. 
The tool and the annotation protocol are available 
at http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/software/. The an- 
notation procedure yielded over the entire corpus 
2641 Japanese edus and 2363 English edus. 
We computed the reliability of the annotation us- 
ing Marcu et al. (1999)'s method for computing 
kappa statistics (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) over hi- 
erarchical structures. Table 1 displays average kappa 
statistics that reflect the reliability of the annota- 
tion of elementary discourse units, k~,, hierarchical 
discourse spans, ks, hierarchical nuclearity assign- 
ments, k,~, and hierarchical rhetorical relation as- 
signments, k~. Kappa figures higher than 0.8 corre- 
spond to good agreement; kappa figures higher than 
0.6 correspond to acceptable agreement. All kappa 
statistics were statistically significant at levels higher 
than a = 0.01. In addition to the kappa statis- 
tics, table 1 also displays in parentheses the average 
number of data points per document, over which the 
kappa statistics were computed. 
For each pair of Japanese-English discourse struc- 
tures, we also built manually an alignment file, 
which specified in the notation discussed on page 1 
the correspondence b tween the edus of the Japanese 
text and the edus of its English translation. 
We computed the similarity between English and 
Japanese discourse trees using labeled recall and pre- 
cision figures that reflected the resemblance of tile 
Japanese and English discourse structures with re- 
spect to their assignment of edu boundaries, hierar- 
chical spans, nuclearity, and rhetorical relations. 
Because the trees we compared differ from one 
language to the other in the number of elementary 
units, the order of these units, and the way the units 
are grouped recursively into discourse spans, we 
computed two types of recall and precision figures. 
In computing Position-Dependent (P-D) recall and 
precision figures, a Japanese span was considered to 
match an English span when the Japanese span con- 
tained all the Japanese dus that corresponded to tile 
edus in the English span, and when the Japanese and 
English spans appeared in tile same position with 
respect to the overall structure. For example, the 
English tree in figure 1 is characterized by 10 sub- 
sentential spans: \[1\], \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[5\], \[6\], \[1,2\], \[4,5\], 
\[3,5\], and \[1,5\]. (Span \[1,6\] subsumes 2 sentences, 
so it is not sub-sentential.) The Japanese discourse 
tree has only 4 spans that could be matched in the 
same positions with English spans, namely spans 
\[1,2\], \[4\], \[5\], and \[1,5\]. Hence the similarity between 
the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect

Table 2: Similarity of the Japanese 
to their discourse structure below the sentence level 
has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/11 (in Fig- 
ure 1, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans). 
In computing Position-Independent (P-I) recall 
and precision figures, even when a Japanese span 
"floated" during the translation to a position in the 
English tree that was different from the position in 
the initial tree, the P-I recall and precision figures 
were not affected. The Position-Independent figures 
reflect the intuition that if two trees tl and t2 both 
have a subtree t, tl and t2 are more similar than 
if they were if they didn't share any tree. At the 
sentence level, we hence assume that if, for exam- 
ple, the syntactic structure of a relative clause is 
translated appropriately (even though it is not ap- 
propriately attached), this is better than translating 
wrongly that clause. The Position-Independent fig- 
ures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing 
discourse trees. They span a wider range of values 
than the Position-Dependent figures, which enable 
a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables 
a better characterization of the differences between 
Japanese and English discourse structures. When 
one takes an optimistic stance, for the spans at the 
sub-sentential level in the trees in Table 1 the recall 
is 6/10 and the precision is 6/11 because in addition 
to spans \[1,2\], \[4\], \[5\], and \[1,5\], one can also match 
Japanese span \[1\] to English span \[2\] and Japanese 
span \[2\] to Japanese span \[1\]. 
In order to provide a better estimate of how close 
two discourse trees were, we computed Position- 
Dependent and -Independent recall and precision fig- 
ures for the sentential level (where units are given by 
edus and spans are given by sets of edus or single sen- 
tences); paragraph level (where units are given by 
sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences 
or single paragraphs); and text level (where units 
are given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets 
of paragraphs). These figures offer a detailed pic- 
ture of how discourse structures and relations are 
mapped from one language to the other across all 
and English discourse structures 
discourse levels, from sentence to text. The differ- 
ences at the sentence level can be explained by differ- 
ences between the syntactic structures of Japanese 
and English. The differences at the paragraph and 
text levels have a purely rhetorical explanation. 
As expected, when we computed the recall and 
precision figures with respect to the nuclearity and 
relation assignments, we also factored in the statuses 
and the rhetorical relations that labeled each pair of 
spans. 
Table 2 smnmarizes the results (P-D and P- 
I (R)ecall and (P)recision figures) for each level 
(Sentence, Paragraph, and Text). The numbers 
in the "Weighted Average" line report averages of 
the Sentence-, Paragraph-, and Text-specific figures, 
weighted according to the number of units at each 
level. The numbers in the "All" line reflect recall and 
precision figures computed across the entire trees, 
with no attention paid to sentence and paragraph 
boundaries. 
Given the significantly different syntactic struc- 
tures of Japanese and English, we were not surprised 
by the low recall and precision results that reflect 
the similarity between discourse trees built below 
the sentence level. However, as Table 2 shows, there 
are significant differences between discourse trees at 
the paragraph and text levels as well. For exam- 
pie, the Position-Independent figures show that only 
about 62% of the sentences and only about 53% of 
the hierarchical spans built across sentences could 
be matched between the two corpora. When one 
looks at the status and rhetorical relations associ- 
ated with the spans built across sentences at the 
paragraph level, the P-I recall and precision figures 
drop to about 43% and 35% respectively. 
The differences in recall and precision are ex- 
plained both by differences in the way information is 
packaged into paragraphs in the two languages and 
the way it is structured rhetorically both within and 
above the paragraph level. 
These results strongly suggest hat if one attempts 
12
to translate Japanese into English on a sentence-by- 
sentence basis, it is likely that the resulting text will 
be unnatural from a discourse perspective. For ex- 
ample, if some information rendered using a CON- 
TRAST relation in Japanese is rendered using an 
ELABORATION relation in English, it would be in- 
appropriate to use a discourse marker like "but" in 
the English translation, although that would be con- 
sistent with the Japanese discourse structure. 
An inspection of the rhetorical mappings between 
Japanese and English revealed that some Japanese 
rhetorical renderings are consistently mapped into 
one or a few preferred renderings in English. For ex- 
ample, 34 of 115 CONTRAST relations in the Japanese 
texts are mapped into CONTRAST relations in En- 
glish; 27 become nuclei of relations uch as ANTITHE- 
SIS and CONCESSION, 14 are translated as COMPAR- 
ISON relations, 6 as satellites of CONCESSION rela- 
tions, 5 as LIST relations, etc. Our goal is to learn 
these systematic discourse mapping rules and exploit 
them in a machine translation context. 
3 Towards  a d i scourse -based  
mach ine  t rans la t ion  sys tem 
3.1 Overa l l  a rch i tec ture  
We are currently working towards building the mod- 
ules of a Discourse-Based Machine Translation sys- 
tem that works along the following lines. 
1. A discourse parser, such as those described by 
Sumita et al. (1992), Kurohashi (1994), and 
MarcH (1999), initially derives the discourse 
structure of the text given as input. 
2. A discourse-structure transfer module 
rewrites the discourse structure of the input 
text so as to reflect a discourse rendering 
that is natural to the target language. 
3. A statistical module maps the input text 
into the target language using translation and 
language models that incorporate discourse- 
specific features, which are extracted from the 
outputs of the discourse parser and discourse 
transfer modules. 
In this paper, we focus only on the discourse- 
structure transfer module. That is, we investigate 
the feasibility of building such a module. 
3.2 The  d i scourse -based  t rans fer  mode l  
In order to learn to rewrite discourse structure trees, 
we first address a related problem, which we define 
below: 
Def in i t ion  3.1 Given two trees Ts and Tt and a 
correspondence Table C defined between Ts and Tt 
at the leaf level in terms of-----, C, D, and ~ relations, 
find a sequence of actions that rewrites the tree T~ 
into Tt. 
If for any tuple (Ts, Tt, C> such a sequence of actions 
can be derived, it is then possible to use a corpus 
of (Ts, Tt, C) tuples in order to automatically learn 
to derive from an unseen tree Ts,, which has the 
same structural properties as the trees Ts, a tree 
Ttj, which has structural properties imilar to those 
of the trees Tt. 
In order to solve the problem in definition 3.1, we 
extend the shift-reduce parsing paradigm applied by 
Magerman (1995), Hermjakob and Mooney (1997), 
and MarcH (1999). In this extended paradigm, the 
transfer process starts with an empty Stack and an 
Input List that contains a sequence of elementary 
discourse trees edts, one edt for each edu in the tree 
Ts given as input. The status and rhetorical rela- 
tion associated with each edt is undefined. At each 
step, the transfer module applies an operation that is 
aimed at building from the units in T, the discourse 
tree Tt. In the context of our discourse-transfer mod- 
ule, we need 7 types of operations: 
 SHIFT operations transfer the first edt from 
the input list into the stack; 
 REDUCE operations pop the two discourse 
trees located at the top of the stack; combine 
them into a new tree updating the statuses 
and rhetorical relation names of the trees in- 
volved in the operation; and push the new 
tree on the top of the stack. These opera- 
tions are used to build the structure of the 
discourse tree in the target language. 
 BREAK operations are used in order to break 
the edt at the beginning of the input list into 
a predetermined number of units. These op- 
erations are used to ensure that the result- 
ing tree has the same number of edts as Tt. 
A BREAK operation is necessary whenever a 
Japanese edu is mapped into nmltiple English 
units. 
 CREATE-NEXT operations are used in order 
to create English discourse constituents that 
have no correspondent in the Japanese tree. 
 FUSE operations are used in order to fuse the 
edt at the top of the stack into the tree that 
immediately precedes it. These operations 
are used whenever multiple Japanese edus are 
mapped into one English edu. 
 SWAP operations wap the edt at the begin- 
ning of the input list with an edt found one 
or more positions to the right. These oper- 
ations are necessary for re-ordering discourse 
constituents. 
 ASSIGNTYPE operations assign one or more of 
the following types to the tree at the top of 
the stack: Unit, MultiUnit, Sentence, Para- 
graph, MultiParagraph, and Text. These op- 
13
erations are necessary in order to ensure sen- 
tence and paragraph boundaries that are spe- 
cific to the target language. 
For example, the first sentence of the English tree in 
Figure 1 can be obtained from the original Japanese 
sequence by following the sequence of actions (5), 
whose effects are shown in Figure 2. For the purpose 
of compactness, the figure does not illustrate the ef- 
fect of ASSIGNTYPE actions. For the same purpose, 
some lines correspond to more than one action,

For our corpus, in order to enable a discourse- 
based transfer module to derive any English dis- 
course tree starting from any Japanese discourse 
tree, it is sufficient o implement: 
* one SHIFT operation; 
 3 x 2 × 85 REDUCE operations; (For each 
of the three possible pairs of nuclear- 
ity assignments NUCLEUS-SATELLITE (NS), 
SATELLITE-NUCLEUS (SN), AND NUCLEUS- 
NUCLEUS (NN), there are two possible ways 
to reduce two adjacent rees (one results 
in a binary tree, the other in a non-binary 
tree (Marcu, 1999)), and 85 relation names.) 
 three types of BREAK operations; (In our cor- 
pus, a Japanese unit is broken into two, three, 
or at most four units.) 
 one type of CREATE-NEXT operation; 
 one type of FUSE operation; 
 eleven types of SWAP operations; (In our 
corpus, Japanese units are at most l l posi- 
tions away from their location in an English- 
specific rendering.) 
 seven types of ASSIGN~\]~YPE operations: Unit, 
MultiUnit, Sentence, MultiSentence, Para- 
graph, MultiParagraph, and Text. 
These actions are sufficient for rewriting any tree 
Ts into any tree Tt, where Tt may have a different 
number of edus, where the edus of Tt may have a 
different ordering than the edus of Ts, and where 
the hierarchical structures of the two trees may be 
different as well. 
3.3 Learn ing  the  parameters  o f  the  
d i scourse - t rans fer  mode l  
We associate with each configuration of our trans- 
fer model a learning case. The cases were gener- 
ated by a program that automatically derived the 
sequence of actions that mapped the Japanese trees 
in our corpus into the sibling English trees, using the 
correspondences at the elementary unit level that 
were constructed manually. Overall, the 40 pairs of 
Japanese and English discourse trees yielded 14108 
cases. 
To each learning example, we associated a set of 
features from the following classes: 
Operat iona l  and  d iscourse  features  reflect the 
number of trees in the stack, the input list, 
and the types of the last five operations. 
They encode information pertaining to the 
types of the partial trees built up to a certain 
t ime and the rhetorical relations that hold be- 
tween these trees. 
Cor respondence-based  features  reflect the nu- 
clearity, rhetorical relations, and types of 
the Japanese trees that correspond to the 
English-like partial trees derived up to a given 
time. 
Lex ica l features  specify whether the Japanese 
spans that correspond to the structures de- 
rived up to a given time use potential dis- 
course markers, such as dakara (because) and 
no ni (although). 
The discourse transfer module uses the C4.5 pro- 
gram (Quinlan, 1993) in order to learn decision trees 
and rules that specify how Japanese discourse trees 
should be mapped into English-like trees. A ten-fold 
cross-validation evaluation of the classifier yielded an 
accuracy of 70.2% (+ 0.21). 
In order to better understand the strengths and 
weaknesses of the classifier, we also attempted to 
break the problem into smaller components. Hence, 
instead of learning all actions at once, we attempted 
to learn first whether the rewriting procedure should 
choose a SHIFT, REDUCE, BREAK, FUSE, SWAP, or 
ASSIGNTYPE operation (the "Main Action Type" 
classifier in table 3), and only then to refine this 
decision by determining what type of reduce opera- 
tion to perform, how many units to break a Japanese 
units into, how big the distance to the SWAP-ed unit 
should be, and what type of ASSIGNTYPE operation 
one should perform. Table 3 shows the sizes of each

data set and the performance of each of these classi- 
tiers, as determined using a ten-fold cross-validation 
procedure. For the purpose of comparison, each clas- 
sifier is paired with a majority baseline. 
The results in Table 3 show that the most diffi- 
cult subtasks to learn are that of determining the 
number of units a Japanese unit should be broken 
into and that of determining the distance to the unit 
that is to be swapped. The features we used are 
not able to refine the baseline classifiers for these 
action types. The confusion matrix for the "Main 
Action Type" classifier (see Table 5) shows that the 
system has trouble mostly identifying BREAK and 
CREATE-NEXT actions. The system has difficulty 
learning what type of nuclearity ordering to pre- 
fer (the "Nuclearity-Reduce" classifier) and what re- 
lation to choose for the English-like structure (the 
"Relation-Reduce" classifier). 
Figure 3 shows a typical learning curve, the one 
that corresponds to the "Reduce Relation" classifier. 
Our learning curves suggest hat more training data 
may improve performance. However, they also sug- 
gest that better features may be needed in order to 
improve performance significantly.

accounts for rhetorical mappings in which the or- 
der of the nucleus and satellite of an ATTRIBUTION 
relation is changed when translated from Japanese 
into English. The second rule was learned in order 
to map EXAMPLE Japanese satellites into EVIDENCE 
English satellites.

By applying the General classifier or the other six 
classifiers successively, one can map any Japanese 
discourse tree into a tree whose structure comes 
closer to the natural rendering of English. To evalu- 
ate the discourse-based transfer module, we carried 
out a ten-fold cross-validation experiment. That is, 
we trained the classifiers on 36 pairs of manually 
built and aligned discourse structures, and we then 
used the learned classifiers in order to map 4 un- 
seen Japanese discourse trees into English-like trees. 
We measured the similarity of the derived trees with 
the English trees built manually, using the metrics 
discussed in Section 2. We repeated the procedure 
ten times, each time training and testing on different 
subsets of tree pairs.

Table 5: Confusion matrix for the Main Action Type 
classifier. 
We take the results reported in Table 2 as a base- 
line for our model. The baseline corresponds to ap- 
plying no knowledge of discourse. Table 6 displays 
the absolute improvement (in percentage points) in 
recall and precision figures obtained when the Gen- 
eral classifier was used to map Japanese trees into 
English-looking trees. The General classifier yielded 
the best results. The results in Table 6 are averaged 
over a ten-fold cross-validation experiment. 
The results in Table 6 show that our model 
outperforms the baseline with respect to building 
English-like discourse structures for sentences, but 
it under-performs the baseline with respect o build- 
ing English-like structures at the paragraph and text 
levels. The main shortcoming of our model seems to 
come from its low performance in assigning para- 
graph boundaries. Because our classifier does not 
learn correctly which spans to consider paragraphs 
and which spans not, the recall and precision results 
at the paragraph and text levels are negatively af- 
fected. The poorer esults at the paragraph and text 
levels can be also explained by errors whose effect cu- 
mulates during the step-by-step tree-reconstruction 
procedure; and by the fact that, for these levels, 
there is less data to learn from. 
However, if one ignores the sentence and para- 
graph boundaries and evaluates the discourse struc- 
tures overall, one can see that our model outper- 
forms the baseline on all accounts according to 
the Position-Dependent evaluation; outperforms the 
baseline with respect to the assignment of elemen- 
tary units, hierarchical spans, and nuclearity sta- 
tuses according to the Position-Independent evalu- 
ation and under-performs the baseline only slightly

according to the Position-Independent evaluation. 
More sophisticated discourse features, such as those 
discussed by Maynard (1998), for example, and a 
tighter integration with the lexicogrammar of the 
two languages may yield better cues for learning 
discourse-based translation models. 
5 Conc lus ion  
We presented a systematic empirical study of the 
role of discourse structure in MT. Our study strongly 
supports the need for enriching MT systems with 
a discourse module, capable of re-ordering and re- 
packaging the information i  a source text in a way 
that is consistent with the discourse rendering of a 
target language. We presented an extended shift- 
reduce parsing model that can be used to map dis- 
course trees specific to a source language into dis- 
course trees specific to a target language. Our model 
outperforms a baseline with respect o its ability to 
predict the discourse structure of sentences. Our 
model also outperforms the baseline with respect 
to its ability to derive discourse structures that are 
closer to the natural, rhetorical rendering in a tar- 
get language than the original discourse structures 
in the source language. Our model is still unable to 
determine correctly how to re-package sentences into 
paragraphs; a better understanding of the notion of 
"paragraph" is required in order to improve this.
