In this paper, it is argued that "coreference" annotations, as performed in the MUC community 
for example, go well beyond annotation of the relation of coreference proper. As a result, it is not 
always clear what semantic relation these annotations are encoding. The paper discusses a number 
of problems with these annotations and concludes that rethinking of the coreference task is needed 
before the task is expanded. In particular, it suggests a division of labor whereby annotation of the 
coreference r lation proper is separated from other tasks such as annotation of bound anaphora 
and of the relation between asubject and a predicative NP. 
1. Introduction: Coreference Annotation 
Various practical tasks requiring language technology including, for example, infor- 
mation extraction and text summarization, can be performed more reliably if it is 
possible to automatically find parts of the text containing information about a given 
topic. For example, if a text summarizer has to select the most important informa- 
tion, in a given text, about the 1984 Wall Street crash, then the summarization task 
is greatly helped if a program can automatically spot all the clauses in the text that 
contain information about this crash. To evaluate a program of this kind, extensive 
language corpora have been prepared in which human readers have annotated what 
has been called the coreference relation. These annotated corpora are then used as a 
gold standard against which the program's achievements can be compared. The re- 
lation of coreference has been defined as holding between two noun phrases if they 
"refer to the same entity" (Hirschman et al. 1997). More precisely, let us assume that 
al and a2 are occurrences of noun phrases (NPs) and let us assume that both have 
a unique referent in the context in which they occur (i.e., their context in the corpus 
makes them unambiguous). Under these assumptions we can use a functional nota- 
tion, e.g. Referent(a), as short for "the entity referred to by a"  and define (suppressing 
the role of context): 
Definition 
al and a2 corefer if and only if Referent(a1) =Referent(a2). 
Putting it simply: to determine whether al and a2 corefer, first determine Referent(a1) 
and Referent(a2), then see if they are equal. 
Ideally, of course, one would like to annotate many other semantic relations that 
hold between parts of a text, because they are also relevant for text interpretation. One 
candidate is the relation of anaphora. Loosely speaking--and glossing over some dif- 
ficulties regarding the precise delimitation of anaphora (Sidner 1979; Partee 1989; van

Deemter 1992)--an NP O~ 1 is said to take an NP a2 as its anaphoric antecedent if and 
only if al depends on Oz2 for its interpretation (e.g., Kamp and Reyle 1993). It follows 
that anaphora nd coreference are different hings. Coreference, for example, is an 
equivalence r lation; anaphora, by contrast, is irreflexive, nonsymmetrical, nd non- 
transitive. Secondly, anaphora, as it has just been defined, implies context-sensitivity 
of interpretation, and this is not true for coreference. For example, a name (President 
W. I. Clinton) and a description (Hillary Rodham's husband) can corefer without either 
of the two depending on the other for its interpretation. Anaphoric and coreferential 
relations can coincide, of course, but not all coreferential relations are anaphoric, nor 
are all anaphoric relations coreferential. (An example of the latter is bound anaphora, 
see Section 2.1.) 
Coreference annotation has been a focus of the Sixth and Seventh Message Under- 
standing Conferences (MUC-6, MUC-7) and various other annotation exercises (e.g., 
Passoneau 1997; Garside, Leech, and McEnery 1997; Davies et al. 1998; Poesio 2000). In 
this squib, we intend to point at some fundamental problems with many of these an- 
notation exercises, which are caused by a failure to distinguish properly between coref- 
erence, anaphora, and other, related phenomena. Because the MUC project is the best- 
known example of coreference annotation, on which much subsequent work is based, 
and because of the public availability of the MUC Task Definition (TD, Hirschman 
and Chinchor \[1997\]), we will focus on MUC. 
Four criteria are listed for the MUC TD, in order of their priority (Hirschman and 
Chinchor 1997): 
. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
The MUC information extraction tasks should be supported by the 
annotations 
Good (defined as ca. 95%) interannotator agreement should be achievable 
It should be possible to annotate texts quickly and cheaply 
A corpus should be created that can be used as a tool for linguists 
outside MUC. 
The TD makes it clear that the annotation task has been simplified in a number of 
ways. For example, only NPs were annotated. Such eminently sensible simplifica- 
tions notwithstanding, wewill argue that the above-mentioned criteria have not been 
achieved and that a rethinking of the coreference annotation enterprise is in order be- 
fore it ventures into new domains involving speech, noisy data, etc. (see for example, 
Bagga, Baldwin, and Shelton \[1999\]), or before it extends the relation of coreference 
to cover whole/part and class/instance r lations (e.g. Popescu-Belis 1998; Hirschman 
and Chinchor 1997). 
2. Problems with Coreference Annotation 
In this section, some unclarities and inconsistencies will be discussed that we found 
in the literature on coreference annotation, and which appear to stem from confusion 
about what reference and coreference are. In Section 2.1, we will explore the tendency 
to apply coreference annotation to nonreferring NPs and bound anaphora, and we 
will argue that this tendency is problematic. In Section 2.2, we will argue that existing 
annotation enterprises still fail to respond properly to the well-known problem of how 
to annotate NPs that are used intensionally. In Section 2.3, we turn to a suggestion 
for the improvement of the actual process of annotation that has been made in the 
630 
van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring 
literature, namely to separate the task of determining the "markables" from that of 
establishing coreference r lations between them, showing that this separation is hard 
to maintain. At the end of each subsection, some suggestions (Remedies) will be made 
on how the problems may be tackled. These suggestions will be elaborated in Section 3. 
2.1 Annotating Nonreferring NPs and Bound Anaphora 
The notion of reference is common to a broad variety of semantic theories (see Gamut 
\[1991\], Chapter 1, for discussion). When speakers/writers use an NP to refer to an 
object or a set of objects, they try to single out the entity uniquely. Thus, when someone 
utters the NP the tenant of the house, the speaker may aim to single out a unique person, 
say Mr. X. Even when this is the case (i.e., the NP is used referentially rather than 
attributively1), the notion of referring has its problems. For example, the speaker may 
be mistaken in her belief that Mr. X is the tenant of the house (Donnellan 1966). In 
such cases it is unclear who is being referred to. Such problems notwithstanding, work 
on coreference annotation has usually taken the notion of reference for granted, on the 
assumption that clear cases, where the referent of an NP is clearly defined, outnumber 
the problematic ones, at least in some important ypes of discourse. 
Let us, for now, buy into the assumption that reference is a straightforward notion. 
Then, following Bach (1987) (especially Sections 3.2 and 12.2), for example, one thing 
that is clear about reference is that some NPs do not refer. When someone says 
(1) a. No solution emerged from our discussions, or 
b. Whenever a solution emerged, we embraced it, 
the solution NPs do not refer to any single solution, nor to any definite set of solutions. 
Most theorists would agree that they do not have a referent. Nonreferring NPs can 
enter anaphoric relations. (For example, the NP a solution is the (bound) anaphoric 
antecedent to it in (lb).) But if they do not refer, the c0reference r lation as defined in 
Section i (which presupposes that Referent(olD and Referent(o~2) are defined) is not ap- 
plicable to them. Even so, the MUC TD asks annotators to treat them as if it was appli- 
cable. It acknowledges (page 10) that "one may argue that \[a bound anaphor and its an- 
tecedent\] are not coreferential in the usual sense," but falls short of explaining explicitly 
what types of anaphora re to be annotated and how (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997). 2
The annotation of bound anaphora merits some further elaboration. Consider, for 
example, quantifying NPs such as Every TV network (or, even more problematic, Most 
computational linguists \[Hirschman and Chinchor 1997\], see also Section 3). If Every TV 
network refers at all, then presumably it refers to the set of all TV networks (relevant to a 
certain domain). The TD, however, asks annotators to let Every TV network corefer with 
its in (lc). According to the definition of coreference, this means that Referent(Every 
TV network) = Referent(its) so that Referent(its) is the set of all TV networks, predicting 
incorrectly that (lc) means (ld): 
(1) c. Every TV network reported its proyqts 
c p. Every TV network reported every TV network's proyqts, 
1 See Donnellan (1966). For an interesting class of attributively used NPs, see van der Sandt (1992); 
examples include hypotheticals like If this house has a tenant then the tenant isprobably Dutch, where one 
might ask whether atenant and the tenant corefer. 
2 Sometimes the term "cospecification" has been employed to replace coreference (e.g. Sidner 1983; 
Davies et al. 1998). It is unclear, however, whether abound anaphor and its antecedent cospecify, or
how the notion should be applied to intensional constructions (Section 2.2). 
631 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
(Incidentally, coreference and anaphora re not only different; they are also extremely 
difficult o combine into a proper equivalence r lationship that allows us to recognize 
different clauses as being "about he same thing." Consider, for example, the relation, 
say R, which holds between NP1 and NP2 if and only if 
either NP1 and NP2 corefer (in the sense of the definition in Section 1) 
or NP1 is an anaphoric antecedent of NP2 
or NP2 is an anaphoric antecedent of NP1 
Note that R is not an equivalence r lation. The subject of (lc), for example, can corefer 
with a plural pronoun in the next sentence, .g., (...) They are now required to do this, 
but They and it (in (lc)) do not stand in the relation R.) 
Predicative NPs are another category of NPs whose referentiality is problematic 
and yet the MUC TD instructs annotators to let them corefer with other NPs. In (2a) 
and (2b), for example, the predicative NP the/a president off DD cannot be replaced 
by the proper name Higgins without changing the meaning of the sentence beyond 
recognition, indicating that the relation between the two NPs must be something other 
than coreference: 
(2) a. Higgins was~became th /a president of DD 
b. Higgins, once the president of DD, is now a humble university lecturer 
We will have more to say about predicative NPs in the next section. 
To sum up, MUC's annotators have been instructed to let NPs of all major classes 
(definite, quantificational, nd indefinite) "corefer" liberally with other NPs, even when 
it is far from clear that the NPs in question have been used referentially. As a result, 
the relation actually annotated in MUC--henceforth called the IDENT relation, fol- 
lowing Hirschman and Chinchor (1997)--must be distinguished from the coreference 
relation. The TD admits that certain instructions may be incompatible with the defini- 
tion of coreference but no reason is given for these incompatibilities and no intuitive 
motivation for the relation IDENT is offered. As a result, the annotator is left with a 
long series of instructions that fail to be held together by a common rationale. 
Remedy. Go back to basics: start from a definition of coreference and write a TD that 
implements he definition. We suggest that it is not until this has been done success- 
fully that extensions into the area of bound anaphora become a risk worth taking. 
2.2 Problems of Intensionality and Predication 
Problems posed to coreference annotation by intensionality (Hirschman et al. 1997) 
have motivated considerable complications in the TD. Consider Section 6.4, which 
discusses the implications of "change over time." The TD says that "two markables 
should be recorded as coreferential if the text asserts them to be coreferential tANY 
TIME" (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997, page 11). Thus, for example, the TD points out 
that in a case like 
(3) Henry Higgins, who was formerly sales director off Sudsy Soaps, became president 
of Dreamy Detergents 
annotators are expected to mark (1) Henry Higgins, (2) sales director of Sudsy Soaps, 
and (3) president of Dreamy Detergents as coreferential. (Similar strategies seem to be 
632 
van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring 
adopted by most practitioners of coreference annotation, e.g., Cristea et al. \[1999\]). But 
since coreference is generally agreed to be a equivalence relation (e.g. Hirschman and 
Chinchor 1997, Section 1.3), this implies that the sales director of Sudsy Soaps and the 
president of Dreamy Detergents are the same person. Clearly, this cannot be right. 
Luckily, there are other parts of the same TD that do a better job of applying the 
notion of coreference to sentences involving change over time. Consider, for example, 
Section 1.3, where the sentence the stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85 is discussed. Here 
annotators are asked to consider the stock price as standing in the IDENT relation with 
$3.85 but not with $4.02, because $3.85 is "the more recent value" (p. 3). (If both 
coreferred with the stock price, it would have followed that $4.02 and $3.85 are equal.) 
This solution, however, is still problematic. What, for instance, if the price continues 
to fall? 
(4) a. The stock price fell from $4.02 to $3.85; 
b. Later that day, it fell to an even lower value, at $3.82. 
Does the annotator have to go back to (4a), deciding that $3.82 is an even more recent 
value and the stock price does not stand in the IDENT relation with $3.85 after all? 
Remedy. At least three different strategies are conceivable. Perhaps most obviously, 
one might decide that coreference between a functional description like those in (3) or 
(4) and an NP denoting a value requires this value to be the present (rather than the 
most recent) value of the function. But, the text does not always say what the present 
value is. Moreover, functional descriptions do not always pertain to the present. In 
Last year, the president resigned, for example, the subject refers to last year's president, and 
consequently, it does not corefer with NPs referring to the present president. A second 
strategy, consistent with Dowty, Wall, and Peters (1981, Appendix iii) might be to say 
that The stock price refers only to a Montague-type individual concept, that is, a function 
from times to numbers. It would follow that The stock price does not corefer with either 
$4.02 or $3.85 and no problem would arise. Analogously, president of Dreamy Detergents, 
in (3) above, where it is used predicatively, might denote an individual concept rather 
than an individual. If the next sentence goes on to say He died within a week, then he 
is coreferential with Henry Higgins; if, instead, the text proceeds This is an influential 
position, but the pay is lousy, then This is coreferential with president of Dreamy Detergents. 
If both these analyses prove to be too complex to be used in large-scale annotation 
exercises, one might have to take the point of view that such descriptions simply do 
not refer. This would amount to a third strategy, which excludes these descriptions 
from entering coreference r lations altogether and leaving their analysis to the other 
tasks. 
2.3 What's Markable? 
It has been proposed that annotation can profitably be broken down into two more 
manageable steps: annotation of markables (step 1) is to be carried out before (step 2) 
partitioning the set of markables into equivalence classes of coreferring elements (e.g., 
Hirschman and Chinchor 1997). It turns out, however, that a strict distinction between 
the two steps is difficult to maintain, because, in principle, almost anything is mark- 
able. In the MUC-7 TD, this is sensibly acknowledged by letting annotators mark up 
certain elements only if they corefer with an existing markable: these include conjuncts 
and prenominal modifiers. In the following example, the first occurrence of aluminum 
is only considered to be markable because it corefers with the occurrence of this noun 
633 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
as a bare NP in the second clause. 
(5) The price of aluminum siding has steadily increased, as the market for 
aluminum reacts to the strike in Chile. (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997) 
In other words: coreference (step 2) helps to determine what the markables are (step 1). 
Finding all the NPs that might participate in coreference becomes even harder if the 
annotation scheme is extended to cover event coreference (noted in the "wish list" in 
Section 1.4 of the TD) since it is often extremely difficult to determine which events 
can serve as antecedents (Hirschman and Chinchor 1997): 
(6) Be careful not to get the gel in your eyes. If this happens, rinse your eyes with 
clean water and tell your doctor. (ABPI, 1997) 
Examples of this kind suggest that one markable (e.g., an event) can give rise to 
another (e.g., the negation of the event). A complication of a similarly algebraic flavor 
arises if "discontinuous elements, including conjoined elements" are covered, as when 
a plural pronoun corefers with a combination ofpreviously occurring NPs (Hirschman 
and Chinchor 1997, section 1.4; see Garside, Leech, and McEnery \[1997\] for a proposal). 
Note especially that annotators would have to be on guard for the possibility of different 
combinations of markables coreferring to each other. A corpus, for example, can easily 
contain NPs A,B,C, and D for which Referent(A) U Referent(B) = Referent(C) U 
Referent(D). Even assuming that each of A, B, C, and D has been properly identified 
as a markable during step 1, this is little guarantee that annotators of step 2 will realize 
the complex coreference r lation between the combination of A and B and that of C 
and D. (Recall that coreference r lations are to be annotated even in the absence of an 
anaphoric relationship.) The number of possible combinations of markables (some 2 n 
when there are n markables) will often be too large to handle. 
Remedy. One alternative is to have a first pass where only referring expressions that 
look like anaphors are marked up, such as pronouns and definite NPs. Subsequent 
passes would look for antecedents for these expressions and link coreferring elements. 
An intermediate approach would be to mark up a core set of referring expressions on 
the first pass, allowing for further eferring expressions to be identified on subsequent 
passes if this is necessary to resolve coreference. The extent o which each strategy 
would contribute to accuracy and speed of annotation remains to be determined. 
3. Conclus ion 
Current "coreference" annotation practice, as exemplified by MUC, has overextended 
itself, mixing elements of genuine coreference with elements of anaphora nd predica- 
tion in unclear and sometimes contradictory ways. As a result, the annotated corpus 
emerging from MUC is unlikely to be as useful for the computational linguistics re- 
search community as one might hope (Criterion 4, see Section 1), the more so because 
generalization to other domains is bound to make problems worse. In many domains, 
for example, other sources of intensionality han change over time occur prominently. 
An example is epistemic modality: 
(7) Henry Higgins might be the man you have talked to. 
634 
van Deemter and Kibble On Coreferring 
The relation between Henry Higgins and the man you have talked to is analogous to that 
between Henry Higgins and sales director of Sudsy Soaps in (3), with possible worlds 
taking the place of points in time: the two NPs refer to the same individual in some 
possible worlds only (see Groenendijk, StokhoL and Veltman \[1996\] for relevant theo- 
retical work). Modality, of course, interacts with tense (as in Henry Higgins might become 
the president of Dreamy Detergents), leading to further complications. 
The MUC TD has addressed many of the difficult problems in the area of reference 
and coreference, but if its success is judged by the criteria in Hirschman and Chinchor 
(1997) (see Introduction), the results are mixed at best. Criterion 4 has been discussed 
above. Concerning Criterion 3, it appears doubtful that the present task definition can 
be applied "quickly and cheaply." Hirschman et al. (1997), when discussing this issue, 
note that interannotator agreement, at the time of writing, was in the low eighties. 
This figure, which falls markedly short of the 95% required by Criterion 2, does not 
seem to have improved substantially since (Breck Baldwin, personal communication). 
Concerning Criterion 1, finally, it has been observed that the figures for recall in the 
MUC information extraction algorithm are rather discouraging (Appelt 1998). The 
material in Section 2 suggests that this relative lack of success is no accident and that 
unclarities in the TD are to blame. Repairs are not always easy to find. Given this 
situation, we suggest that a rethinking of the coreference task is required. 
Firstly, one needs a consistent story of what reference and coreference are taken 
to be. Theoretical work on reference does not show a consensus on some crucial ques- 
tions in this area (Bach 1987; Kronfeld and Roberts 1998). Different answers have been 
suggested, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, one might 
identify the notion of a referring NP with that of a semantically definite NP in the sense 
of Barwise and Cooper (1981). 3This would include proper names, extensional definite 
descriptions, universally quantified NPs, and specifically used indefinites (e.g., a com- 
pany whose name is withheld), but it would exclude nonspecifically used indefinites such 
as at least n companies, most computational linguists. A more liberal approach along the 
lines of Kamp and Reyle (1993, Chapter 4), would predict hat a quantifying NP such 
as the subject of Most computational linguists use a parser refers to the set of those com- 
putational linguists who use a parser: the VP helps to determine the referent of the NP. 
The first approach would make annotation easier to perform and the results would be 
likely to be more reliable as a result, but it would feed less information i to the infor- 
mation extraction task. Trade-offs of this kind are unavoidable, and experimentation 
will be required to determine which option provides the best results. 
Secondly, we suggest a further division of labor whereby those phenomena that 
are no longer accounted for in the new TD are covered by other tasks (Kibble and 
van Deemter 2000). For example, the two NPs Henry Higgins and president of Sudsy 
Soaps (example (3)) do not corefer, and the relation between them should be irrelevant 
to coreference annotation. If it is imperative that information about Henry's previous 
jobs be saved for posterity then some other annotation task has to be defined, with 
its own very different TD, involving the notion of individuals having properties at 
certain times or intervals only. Something analogous is true for the annotation of 
bound anaphora. 
The issue under discussion illustrates a more general point. It is now widely 
agreed that linguistic theorizing is sometimes insufficiently informed by observational 
data. Conversely, we would like to submit that corpus-based research is sometimes 
3 A semantically definite NP c~ is one whose set-theoretic denotation takes the form of a principal filter 
(Partee, ter Meulen, and Wall 1990), i.e., a set of the form {X: Y C X} for some set of individuals Y. 
635 
Computational Linguistics Volume 26, Number 4 
insufficiently informed by theory. It follows, in our opinion, that there is scope for 
more collaboration between theoretical and corpus-based linguists in this area. This 
squib attempts to be a small step in this direction.
