Abstract
An A-C bilingual dictionary can be inferred
by merging A-B and B-C dictionaries using B
as pivot. However, polysemous pivot words
often produce wrong translation candidates.
This paper analyzes two methods for pruning
wrong candidates: one based on exploiting
the structure of the source dictionaries, and
the other based on distributional similarity
computed from comparable corpora. As
both methods depend exclusively on easily
available resources, they are well suited
to less resourced languages. We studied
whether these two techniques complement
each other given that they are based on
different paradigms. We also researched
combining them by looking for the best
adequacy depending on various application
scenarios.
1 Introduction
Nobody doubts the usefulness and multiple
applications of bilingual dictionaries: as the final
product in lexicography, translation, language
learning, etc. or as a basic resource in several fields
such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) or
Information Retrieval (IR), too. Unfortunately, only
major languages have many bilingual dictionaries.
Furthermore, construction by hand is a very tedious
job. Therefore, less resourced languages (as well as
less-common language pairs) could benefit from a
method to reduce the costs of constructing bilingual
dictionaries. With the growth of the web, resources
like Wikipedia seem to be a good option to extract
new bilingual lexicon (Erdmann et al., 2008), but
the reality is that a dictionary is quite different from
an encyclopedia. Wiktionary1 is a promising asset
more oriented towards lexicography. However, the
presence of less resourced languages in these kinds
of resources is still relative -in Wikipedia, too-.
Another way to create bilingual dictionaries is
by using the most widespread languages (e.g.,
English, Spanish, French...) as a bridge between
less resourced languages, since most languages
have some bilingual dictionary to/from a major
language. These pivot techniques allow new
bilingual dictionaries to be built automatically.
However, as the next section will show, it is no
small task because translation between words is
not a transitive relation at all. The presence of
polysemous or ambiguous words in any of the
dictionaries involved may produce wrong translation
pairs. Several techniques have been proposed
to deal with these ambiguity cases (Tanaka and
Umemura, 1994; Shirai and Yamamoto, 2001; Bond
et al., 2001; Paik et al., 2004; Kaji et al., 2008;
Shezaf and Rappoport, 2010). However, each
technique has different performance and properties
producing dictionaries of certain characteristics,
such as different levels of coverage of entries and/or
translations. The importance of these characteristics
depends on the context of use of the dictionary.
For example, a small dictionary containing the
most basic vocabulary and the corresponding most
frequent translations can be adequate for some
IR and NLP tasks, tourism, or initial stages of
language learning. Alternatively, a dictionary which
maximizes the vocabulary coverage is more oriented
towards advanced users or translation services.
This paper addresses the problem of pruning

wrong translations when building bilingual
dictionaries by means of pivot techniques. We
aimed to come up with a method suitable for
less resourced languages. We analyzed two of
the approaches proposed in the literature which
are not very demanding on resources: Inverse
Consultation (IC) (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) and
Distributional Similarity (DS) (Kaji et al., 2008),
their strong points and weaknesses, and proposed
that these two paradigms be combined. For this
purpose, we studied the effect the attributes of
the source dictionaries have on the performance
of IC and DS-based methods, as well as the
characteristics of the dictionaries produced. This
could allow us to predict the performance of each
method just by looking at the characteristics of the
source dictionaries. Finally, we tried to provide
the best combination adapted to various application
scenarios which can be extrapolated to other
languages.
The basis of the pivot technique is dealt with in
the next section, and the state of the art in pivot
techniques is reviewed in the third section. After
that, the analysis of the aforementioned approaches
and experiments carried out for that purpose are
presented, and a proposal for combining both
paradigms is included. The paper ends by drawing
some conclusions from the results.
2 Pivot Technique
The basic pivot-oriented construction method is
based on assuming the transitive relation of the
translation of a word between two languages. Thus:
if p (pivot word) is a translation of s (source
word) in the A-B dictionary and t (target word)
is a translation of p in the B-C dictionary, we
can say that t is therefore a translation of s, or
translationA,B(s) = p and translationB,C(p) =
t? translationA,C(s) = t
This simplification is incorrect because it does
not take into account word senses. Translations
correspond to certain senses of the source words. If
we look at figure 1, t (case of t1 and t2) can be the
translation of p (p2) for a sense c (c3) different from
the sense for which p (p2) is the equivalent of s (c1).
This can happen when p pivot word is polysemous.
It could be thought that these causalities are
Figure 1: Ambiguity problem of the pivot technique.
not frequent, and that the performance of this
basic approach could be acceptable. Let us
analyze a real case. We merged a Basque-English
dictionary composed of 17,672 entries and 43,021
pairs with an English-Spanish one composed of
16,326 entries and 38,128 pairs, and obtained
a noised Basque-Spanish dictionary comprising
14,000 entries and 104,165 pairs. 10,000 (99,844
pairs) among all the entries have more than one
translation. An automatic evaluation shows that
80.32% of these ambiguous entries contain incorrect
translation equivalents (80,200 pairs out of 99,844).
These results show that a basic pivot-oriented
method is very sensitive to the ambiguity level of
the source dictionaries. The conclusion is that the
transitive relation between words across languages
can not be assumed, because of the large number of
ambiguous entries that dictionaries actually have. A
more precise statement for the transitive property in
the translation process would be:
if p (pivot word) is a translation of s with respect
to a sense c and t is a translation of p with
respect to the same sense c we can say that t is
a translation of s, or translationA,B(sc1) = p
and translationB,C(pc2) = t and c1 = c2 ?
translationA,C(s) = t
Unfortunately, most dictionaries lack comparable
information about senses in their entries. So it is not
possible to map entries and translation equivalents
according to their corresponding senses. As an
alternative, most papers try to guide this mapping
according to semantic distances extracted from the
dictionaries themselves or from external resources
847
such as corpora.
Another problem inherent in pivot-based
techniques consists of missing translations. This
consists of pairs of equivalents not identified in the
pivot process because there is no pivot word, or else
one of the equivalents is not present. We will not be
dealing with this issue in this work so that we can
focus on the translation ambiguity problem.
3 State of the Art
In order to reject wrong translation pairs, Tanaka
et al. (1994) worked with the structure of the
source dictionaries and introduced the IC method
which measures the semantic distance between two
words according to the number of pivot-words
they share. This method was extended by using
additional information from dictionaries, such as
semantic classes and POS information in (Bond et
al., 2001; Bond and Ogura, 2007). Sjo¨bergh (2005)
compared full definitions in order to detect words
corresponding to the same sense. However, not all
the dictionaries provide this kind of information.
Therefore, external knowledge needs to be used
in order to guide mapping according to sense.
Istva´n et al. (2009) proposed using WordNet, only
for the pivot language (for English in their case),
to take advantage of all the semantic information
that WordNet can provide. Mausam et. al.
(2009) researched the use of multiple languages as
pivots, on the hypothesis that the more languages
used, the more evidences will be found to find
translation equivalents. They used Wiktionary for
building a multilingual lexicon. Tsunakawa et al.
(2008) used parallel corpora to estimate translation
probabilities between possible translation pairs.
Those reaching a minimum threshold are accepted
as correct translations to be included in the target
dictionary. However, even if this strategy achieves
the best results in the terminology extraction field,
it is not adequate when less resourced languages are
involved because parallel corpora are very scarce.
As an alternative, (Kaji et al., 2008; Gamallo
and Pichel, 2010) proposed methods to eliminate
spurious translations using cross-lingual context or
distributional similarity calculated from comparable
corpora. In this line of work, (Shezaf and
Rappoport, 2010) propose a variant of DS, and show
how it outperforms the IC method. In comparison,
our work focuses on analyzing the strong and weak
points of each technique and aims to combine the
benefits of each of them.
Other characteristics of the merged dictionaries
like directionality (Paik et al., 2004) also influence
the results.
4 Experimental Setup
This work focuses on adequate approaches for less
resourced languages. Thus, the assumption for the
experimentation is that few resources are available
for both source and target languages. The resources
for building the new dictionary are two basic (no
definitions, no senses) bilingual dictionaries (A-B,
B-C) including source (A), target (C) and a pivot
language (B), as well as a comparable corpus for
the source-target (A-C) language pair. We explored
the IC (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994) and DS (Kaji
et al., 2008; Gamallo and Pichel, 2010) approaches.
In our experiments, the source and target languages
are Basque and Spanish, respectively, and English is
used for pivot purposes. In any case, the experiments
could be conducted with any other language set, so
long the required resources are available.
It must be noted that the proposed task is not
a real problem because there is a Basque-Spanish
dictionary already available. Resources like
parallel corpora for that language pair are also
available. These dictionaries and pivot language
were selected in order to be able to evaluate the
results automatically. During the evaluation we
also used frequency information extracted from a
parallel corpus, but then again, this corpus was not
used during the dictionary building process, and
therefore, it would not be used in a real application
environment.
4.1 Resources
In order to carry out the experiments we used three
dictionaries. The two dictionaries mentioned in
the previous section (Basque-English Deu?en and
English-Spanish Den?es) were used to produce a
new Basque-Spanish Deu?en?es dictionary. In
addition, we used a Basque-Spanish Deu?es
dictionary for evaluation purposes. Its broad
coverage is indicative of its suitability as a reference
848
dictionary. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of
the dictionaries. We can observe that the ambiguity
level of the entries (average number of translations
per source word) is significant. This produces more
noise in the pivot process, but it also benefits IC due
to the increase in pivot words. As for the directions
of source dictionaries, English is taken as target.
Like Paik et al. (2004) we obtained the best coverage
of pairs in that way.
Dictionary #entries #pairs ambiguity
level
Deu?en 17,672 43,021 2.43
Den?es 16,326 38,128 2.33
Deu?es(reference) 57,334 138,579 2.42
Deu?en?es(noisy) 14,601 104,172 7.13
Table 1: Characteristics of the dictionaries.
Since we were aiming to merge two general
dictionaries, the most adequate strategy was to use
open domain corpora to compute DS. The domain
of journalism is considered to be close to the open
domain, and so we constructed a Basque-Spanish
comparable corpus composed of news articles (see
Table 2). The articles were gathered from the
newspaper Diario Vasco (Hereinafter DV) for the
Spanish part and from the Berria newspaper for the
Basque part. Both publications focus on the Basque
Country. In order to achieve a higher comparability
degree, some constraints were applied:
• News in both languages corresponded to the
same time span, 2006-2010.
• News corresponding to unrelated categories
between newspapers were discarded.
Corpus #words #docs
Berria(eu) 40Mw 149,892
DV(es) 77Mw 306,924
Table 2: Characteristics of the comparable corpora.
In addition, as mentioned above, we extracted
the frequencies of translation pairs from a
Basque-Spanish parallel corpus. The corpus
had 295,026 bilingual segments (4 Mw in Basque
and 4.7 Mw in Spanish) from the domain of
journalism.
5 Pruning Methods
IC and DS a priori suffer different weak points. IC
depends on the structure of the source dictionaries.
On the other hand, DS depends on a good
comparable corpus and translation process. DS is
measured more precisely between frequent words
because context representation is richer.
The conditions for good performance of both IC
and DS are analyzed below. These conditions will
then be linked to the required characteristics for the
initial dictionaries. In addition, we will measure
how divergent the entries solved for each method
are.
5.1 Inverse consultation
IC uses the structure of the Da?b and Db?c
source dictionaries to measure the similarity of
the meanings between source word and translation
candidate. The description provided by Tanaka et
al. (1994) is summarized as follows. To find
suitable equivalents for a given entry, all target
language translations of each pivot translation are
looked up (e.g., Db?c(Da?b(s))). This way, all
the “equivalence candidates” (ECs) are obtained.
Then, each one is looked up in the inverse direction
(following the previous example, Dc?b(t)) to create
a set of words called “selection area” (SA). The
number of common elements of the same language
between SA and the translations or equivalences (E)
obtained in the original direction (Da?b(s)) is used
to measure the semantic distance between entries
and corresponding translations. The more matches
there are, the better the candidate is. If only one
inverse dictionary is consulted, the method is called
“one time inverse consultation” or IC1. If n inverse
dictionaries are consulted, the method is called “n
time inverse consultation”. As there is no significant
difference in performance, we simply implemented
IC1. Assuming that each element (x) of these two
sets (SA,E) has a weight that is determined by the
number of times it appears in the set that belongs
(X), this weight is denoted as ?(X,x). In the same
way, the number of common elements between SA
and E is denoted as follows:
?(E,SA) =
?
x?SA
?(E, x) (1)
849
IC asks for more than one pivot word between
source word s and translation candidate t. In our
example:
?(Da?b(s), Dc?b(t)) > 1 (2)
In general, this condition guarantees that pivot
words belong to the same sense of the source word
(e.g. iturri?tap?grifo, iturri?faucet?grifo).
Consequently, source word and target word also
belong to the same sense.
Conceptually, the IC method is based on the
confluence of two evidences. Let us take
our dictionaries as examples. If two or more
pivot words share a translation t in the Des?en
dictionary (|tr(tc, Des?en| > 1) (e.g. grifo?tap,
grifo?faucet) we could hypothesize that they
are lexical variants belonging to a unique sense
c. If an entry s includes those translations
(|tr(sc, Deu?en)| > 1) (e.g. iturri?tap,
iturri?faucet)) in the Deu?en dictionary, we could
also hypothesize the same. We can conclude that
entry s and candidate t are mutual translations
because the hypothesis that “faucet” and “tap” are
lexical variants of the same sense c is contrasted
against two evidences. This makes IC highly
dependant on the number of lexical variants.
Specifically, IC needs several lexical variants in
the pivot language per each entry sense in both
dictionaries. Assuming that wrong pairs cannot
fulfill this requirement (see Formula 2) we can
estimate the probabilities of the conditions for
solving an ambiguous pair (s, t) where s and t ? c,
as follows:
(a) p(|tr(sc, Da?b)| > 1): Estimated by
computing the average coverage of lexical
variants in the pivot language for each entry in
Da?b.
(b) p(|tr(tc, Dc?b)| > 1): Estimated by
computing the average coverage of lexical
variants in the pivot language for each entry in
Dc?b.
(c) p(|tr(sc, Da?b)? tr(tc, Dc?b)| > 1):
Convergence degree between translations of s
and t in Da?b and Dc?b corresponding to c.
So, in order to obtain a good performance with IC,
the dictionaries used need to provide a high coverage
of lexical variants per sense in the pivot language.
If we assume that variants of a sense do not vary
considerably between dictionaries, performance of
IC in terms of recall would be estimated as follows:
R = p(|tr(sc, Da?b)| > 1) ? p(|tr(tc, Dc?b)| > 1)
(3)
We estimated the adequacy of the different
dictionaries in the experimental setup according
to estimations (a) and (b). Average coverage of
lexical variants in the pivot language was calculated
for both dictionaries. It was possible because
lexical variants in the target language were grouped
according to senses in both dictionaries. Only
ambiguous entries were analyzed because they are
the set of entries which IC must solve. In the
Deu?en dictionary more than 75% of senses have
more than one lexical variant in the pivot language.
So, p(|tr(sc, Deu?en)| > 1) = 0.75. In
Des?en this percentage (23%) is much lower. So,
p(|tr(tc, Des?en)| > 1) = 0.23. Therefore,
Deu?en dictionary is more suited to the IC method
than Des?en. As the conditions must be met in
the maximum of both dictionaries, performance
according to Formula 3 would be: 0.75 ? 0.23 =
0.17. This means that IC alone could solve about
17% of ambiguous entries.
5.2 Distributional Similarity
DS has been used successfully for extracting
bilingual terminology from comparable corpora.
The underlying idea is to identify as translation
equivalents those words which show similar
distributions or contexts across two corpora of
different languages, assuming that this similarity
is proportional to the semantic distance. In
other words, establishing an equivalence between
cross lingual semantic distance and translation
probability. This technique can be used for pruning
wrong translations produced in a pivot-based
dictionary building process (Kaji et al., 2008;
Gamallo and Pichel, 2010).
We used the traditional approach to compute
DS (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1999). Following the
“bag-of-words” paradigm, the contexts of a word w
850
are represented by weighted collections of words.
Those words are delimited by a window (±5
words around w) and punctuation marks. The
context words are weighted with regard to w
according to the Log-likelihood ratio measure, and
the context vector ofw is formed. After representing
word contexts in both languages, the algorithm
computes for each source word the similarity
between its context vector and all the context vectors
corresponding to words in the target language by
means of the cosine measure. To be able to
compute the cross-lingual similarity, the context
vectors are put in the same space by translating
the vectors of the source words into the target
language. This is done by using a seed bilingual
dictionary. The problem is that we do not have that
bilingual dictionary, since that is precisely the one
we are trying to build. We propose that dictionaries
extracted from our noisy dictionary (Deu?en?es) be
used:
• Including the unambiguous entries only
• Including unambiguous entries and selecting
the most frequent candidates according to the
target language corpus for ambiguous entries
• The dictionary produced by the IC1 method
The second method performed better in the tests
we carried out. So, that is the method implemented
for the experiments in the next section.
DS calls for several conditions in order to perform
well. For solving an ambiguous translation t
of a source word s, both context representations
must be accurate. The higher their frequency in
the comparable corpus, the richer their context
representation will be. In addition to context
representation, the translation quality of contexts is
also a critical factor for the performance of DS.
Factors can be formulated as follows if we assume
big and highly comparable corpora:
(a) Precision of context representation: this can be
estimated by computing the frequency of the
words
(b) Precision of translation process: this can be
estimated by computing the quality of the seed
dictionary
6 Results
In order to evaluate the performance of each pruning
method, the quality of the translations was measured
according to the average precision and recall of
translations per entry with respect to the reference
dictionary. As we were not interested in dealing with
missing translations, the reference for calculating
recall was drawn up with respect to the intersection
between the merged dictionary (Deu?en?es) and
the reference dictionary (Deu?es). F-score is the
metric that combines both precision and recall.
We also introduced the frequency of use of both
entry and pair as an aspect to take into account in the
analysis of the results. It is better to deal effectively
with frequent words and frequent translations than
rare ones. Frequency of use of Basque words
and frequency of source-target translation equivalent
pairs were extracted respectively from the open
domain monolingual corpus and the parallel corpus
described in the previous section. Corpora were
lemmatized and POS tagged in both cases in order
to extract the frequency information of the lemmas.
Figure 2: Precision results according to the minimum
frequency of entries.
6.1 Inverse Consultation
Results show that IC precision is about 0.6 (See
Figure 2). This means that many wrong pairs
fulfill IC conditions. After analyzing the wrong
pairs by hand, we observed that some of them
corresponded to correct pairs not included in the
reference dictionary. They are not included in
851

frequency of entries.

frequency of entries.
the reference because not all synonyms -or lexical
variants- are included in it, only the most common
ones. This is an inherent problem in automatic
evaluation, and affects all the experiments presented
throughout section 6 equally. Other wrong pairs
comprise translation equivalents which have the
same stem but different gramatical categories (e.g.,
’aldakuntza’ (noun) (change, shift) ? ’cambiar’
(verb) (to change, to shift)). These wrong cases
could be filtered if POS information would be
available in the source dictionaries.
Precision is slightly better when dealing with
frequent words, a maximum of 0.62 is reached when
minimum frequency is between 150 and 2,000.
Precision starts to decline significantly when dealing
Figure 5: Recall results according to the minimum
frequency of translation pairs.
with those entries over a minimum frequency of
10,000. However, only very few entries (234) reach
that minimum frequency.
Recall is about 0.2 (See Figure 3), close to the
estimation computed in section 5.1. It presents a
more marked variability according to the frequency
of entries, improving the performance as the
frecuency increases. This could be due to the fact
that frequent entries tend to have more translation
variants (See Table 3). The fact that there are
too many candidates to solve would explain why
the recall starts to decline when dealing with very
frequent entries.
Global performance according to F-score reflects
the variability depending on frequency (See Figure
4).
Recall according to frequency of pairs provides
information about whether IC selects rare
translations or the most probable ones (See
Figure 5). It must be noted that this recall is
calculated with respect to the translation pairs of
the merged dictionary Deu?en?es which appear
in the parallel corpus (see section 4.1). Results
(See Figure 5) show that IC deals much better
with frequent translation pairs. However, recall
for pairs whose frequency is higher than 100 only
reaches 0.5. Even if the maximum recall is achieved
for pairs whose frequency is above 40,000, it is
not significant because they suppose a minimum
number (3 pairs). In short, we can conclude that IC
often does not find the most probable translation
852
(e.g. ’usain’?’olor’ (smell), ’zulo’?’agujero’
(hole),...).
6.2 Distributional Similarity
DS provides an idea of semantic distance. However,
in order to determine whether a candidate is a
correct translation, a minimum threshold must
be established. It is very difficult to establish
a threshold manually because its performance
depends on the characteristics of the corpora and the
seed dictionaries. The threshold can be applied at a
global level, by establishing a numeric threshold for
all candidates, or at local level by selecting certain
top ranked candidates for each entry. The dictionary
created by IC or unambiguous pairs can be used
as a reference for tuning the threshold in a robust
way with respect to the evaluation score such as
F-score. In our experiments, thresholds estimated
against the dictionary created by IC are very close to
those calculated with respect to the whole reference
dictionary (see Figure 6).
Figure 6: Threshold parameter tuning comparison for
different Fn scores. Tuning against dictionary created by
IC vs. Reference dictionary.
There is not much variation in performance
between local and global thresholds. Precision
increases from 0.4 to 0.5 depending on the strictness
level of the threshold (See Figure 2), the stricter
the better. In all cases, precision is slightly better
when dealing with frequent words (frequency >
20). This improvement is more marked with
the strictest thresholds (TOP1, 0.1). However,
if global thresholds are used, performance starts
to decline significantly when dealing with words
whose frequency is above 1,000. So, it seems that
local thresholds (TOP3) perform more consistendly
with respect to the high frequencies of entries.
Recall (See Figure 3) goes from 0.5 to 0.7
depending on the strictness level of the threshold.
It starts declining when frequency is above 50
depending on the type of threshold. In this case,
global thresholds seem to perform better because
the most frequent entries are handled better. These
entries tend to have many translations. Therefore
thresholds based on top ranks are too rigid.
There is no significant difference between global
and local thresholds in terms of F-Score (See Figure
4). Each threshold type is more stable in precision or
recall. So the F-Score is similar for both. Variability
of F-Score according to frequency is lower than
in precision and recall. As performance peaks on
both measures at different points of frequency, the
variability is mitigated when measures are combined
by F-Score.
We have plotted the recall according to the
frequency of pairs calculated from a parallel corpus
in order to analyze the performance of DS when
dealing with frequent translation pairs (See Figure
5). The performance decreases when dealing with
pairs whose frequency is higher than 100. This
means that DSs performance is worse when dealing
with the most common translation pairs. So it is
clear that it is very difficult to represent the contexts
of very frequent words correctly.
The results show that DS rankings are worse
when dealing with some words above a certain
frequency threshold (e.g. ’on’ ’good’, ’berriz’
’again’, ’buru’ ’head’, ’orain’ ’now’...). Although
context representation of frequent words is based
on many evidences, high polysemy level related
to high frequency leads to a poorer representation.
Alternatively we found that some of those frequent
words are not very polysemous. Those words
do not have strong collocates, that is, they tend
to appear freely in contexts, which also leads to
poor representation. This low quality representation
hampers an accurate computation of semantic
distance.
6.3 Comparison between IC and DS
As for average precision, IC provides better results
than DS if all entries are taken into account.
However, DS tips the scales in its favor if only
entries with frequencies above 50 are considered and
strict thresholds are used (TOP1, 0.1).
DS clearly outperforms IC in terms of average
recall of translations. Even if strict thresholds
are used, DS outperforms IC for all entries whose
853
frequency is lower than 640.
If average precision and recall are evaluated
together by means of F-score, DS outperforms IC
(Figure 4). Only when dealing with very frequent
entries (frequency > 8, 000) is ICs performance
close to DSs, but these entries make up a very small
group (234 entries).
In order to compare the recall with respect to
the frequency of translation pairs under the same
conditions, we have to select a threshold that
provides a similar precision to IC. TOP1 is the
most similar one (see figure 2). As Figure 5
shows, again DS is better than IC. Even if IC’s
recall clearly surpasses DS’s when dealing with
frequent translation pairs (frequency > 2, 560), it
only represents a minimal number of pairs (39).
6.4 Combining IC and DS according to
different scenarios
In order to see how the methods can complement
each other, we calculated the performance
for solving ambiguous entries obtained by
combining the results of both methods using
various alternatives:
• Union: IC ? DS: Pairs obtained by both
methods are merged. Duplicated pairs are
cleaned.
• Lineal combination (Lcomb): IC ? k +
DS ? (1 ? k). Each method provides a
value representing the translation score. For
IC that value is the number of pivot words
(see Formula 1), and the context similarity
score in the case of DS. Those values are
linearly combined and applied over the noised
dictionary.
As mentioned in the first section, one of the goals
of the paper was to analyze which method and
which combination was best depending on the use
case. We have selected some measures which are a
good indicator of good performance for different use
cases:
• AvgF : Average F-score per entry.
• wAvgF : Average F-score per entry weighted
by the frequency of the entry. Higher frequency
increases the weight.
• AvgF2: Average F-score per entry where recall
is weighted higher.
• AvgF0.5: Average F-score per entry where
precision is weighted higher.
For the use cases presented in section 1, some
measures will provide richer information than
others. On the one hand, if we aim to build small,
accurate dictionaries, AvgF0.5 would be a better
indicator since it attaches more importance to high
precision. In addition, if we want the dictionaries
to cover the most common entries (e.g., in a basic
dictionary for language learners) it is also interesting
to look at wAvgF values because greater value is
given to finding translations for the most frequent
words. On the other hand, if our objective is to
build big dictionaries with a high recall, it would
be better to look at AvgF2 measure which attaches
importance to recall.
Method AvgF wAvgF AvgF2 AvgF0.5
IC 0.34 0.27 0.27 0.46
DS 0.47 0.44 0.64 0.46
Union 0.52 0.49 0.65 0.49
Lcomb 0.52 0.49 0.67 0.52
Table 3: Performance results of methods for ambiguous
entries according to different measures.
Table 3 shows the results for the different
combinations. The parameters of all methods
are optimized for each metric (as explained in
section 6.2, see figure 6). In all cases, the
combinations surpass the results of both methods
separately. There is a reasonable improvement over
DS (10.6% for AvgF ), and an even more startling
one over IC (52.9% for AvgF ). IC only gets
anywhere near the other methods when precision
is given priority (AvgF0.5). There is no significant
difference in terms of performance between the two
combinations, although Lcomb is slightly better.
wAvgF measure is stricter than the others since
it takes frequency of entries into account. This is
emphasised more in the case of IC where results
decrease notably compared with AvgF .

7 Conclusions
This paper has analyzed IC and DS, for the
task of pruning wrong translations from bilingual
dictionaries built by means of pivot techniques.
After analyzing their strong and weak points we
have showed that IC requires high ambiguity level
dictionaries with several lexical variants per entry
sense. With an average ambiguity close to 2
translation candidates DS obtains better results. IC
is a high precision method, but contrary to our
expectations, it seems that it is not much more
precise than DS. In addition, DS offers much better
recall of translations and entries. As a result, DS
performs the best if both precision and recall are
taken into account by F-score.
Both methods prune most probable translations
for a significant number of frequent entries. DS
encounters a problem when dealing with very
frequent words due to the difficulty in representing
their context. The main reason behind this is the
high polysemy level of those words.
Our initial beliefs were that the translations
found by each method would diverge to a certain
extent. The results obtained when combining the
two methods show that although the performance
does not increase as much as expected (10.6%
improvement over DS), there is in fact some
divergence. As for the different use cases proposed,
combinations offer the best performance in all cases.
IC is indeed the poorer method, although it presents
competitive results when precision is given priority.
Future experiments include contrasting these
results with other dictionaries and language pairs.
