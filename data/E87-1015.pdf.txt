ABSTRACT 
At our institute a speech understanding and dialog system is 
developed. As an example we model an information system for 
timetables and other information about intercity trains. 
In understanding spoken utterances, additional problems arise due 
to pronunciation variabilities and vagueness of the word recognition 
process. Experiments so far have also shown that the syntactical 
analysis produces a lot more hypotheses instead of reducing the 
number of word hypotheses. The reason for that is the possibility o! 
combining nearly every group of word hypotheses which are 
adjacent with respect to the speech signal to a syntactically correct 
constituent. Also, the domain independent semantic analysis cannot 
be used for filtering, because a syntactic sentence hypothesis 
normally can be interp.reted in several different ways, respectively a 
set of syntactic hypotheses for constituents can be combined to a lot 
of semantically interpretible sentences. Because of this 
combinatorial explcaiun it seems to be reasonable to introduce 
domain dependent and contextual knowledge as early as possible, 
also for the semantic analysis. On the other hand it would be more 
efficient prior to the whole semantic interpretation f each syntactic 
hypothesis or combination of syntactic hypotheses to find possible 
candidates with less effort and interpret only the more probable 
Ones. 
1. Introduction 
In the speech understanding and dialog system EVAR (Niemann 
et al. 1985) developed at our institute there are four different 
modules for understanding an utterance of the user (Brietzmaun 
1984): the syntactic analysis, the task-independent semantic 
analysis, the domain-dependent pcagmatic analysis, and another 
module for dialog-specific aspects. The semantic module disregards 
nearly all of the thematic and situational context. Only isolated 
utterances are analyzed. So the main points of interests are the 
semantic onsistency of words and the underlying relational structure 
of the sentence. The analysis of the functional relations is based on 
the valency and case theory (Tesniero 1966, Fillmore 1967). In this 
theory the head verb of the sentence determines how many noun 
groups or prel:csitional groups are needed for building up a 
syntactically correct and semantically consistent sentence. For these 
slots in a verb frame further syntactic and semantic restrictions can 
also be given. 
2. Semtntic and Progmstic Consistency 
Semantic Consistency 
The semantic knowledge of the module consists of lexical 
meanings of words and selectional restrictior~ between them. These 
restrictions are possible for a special word, fur example the 
preposition ' ach' ('to Hamburg') requires a noun with the meamng 
LOCation. In the case of a frame they are for a whole constituent; 
for example, the verb 'wchnen' ('to live in Hamburg') needs a 
preposition~l group also with the me'~ning LOCation. 
The selectional restrictions are expressed in the dictionary by the 
feature SELECTION. The semantic classes (features) are 
hierarchically organized in a way, so that all subclasses of a class also 
are accepted as compatible. For example, if a word with the 
semantic lass CONcrete is required, also a word with the class 
ANimate (a subclass of CONcrete) or with the class HUman (a 
subclass of ANimate) is accepted.

Fig. 1: Semantic lassification of nouns (part) 
In Fig. 1 a part or our semantic lassification system for nouns is 
shown. For each prepo~tiun or adjective there can be determined 
with which nouns they could be combined. That is done by selecting 
the semantic class of the head noun of a noun group or prepositional 
group. For example 'in' in its temporal meaning can be used with 
nouns as 
Fig. 2 shows, how this system could be used to solve ambiguities.

For example:

CLAS~ TRAnsport, LOCation 
coach.l.2: "privat tutor, trainer in athletics" 
CLASS: ACtingPerson 
in  
in.l.l: "in the evening" 
CLASS: DURation 
SELECTION: TIMe 
in.l.2: "in the room" 
CLASS: PLAce 
SELECTION: LOCation 
Fig. 2: Semantic Interpretation f "in the coech" 
Although there are 4 possibilities for combining the words in 
their different meanings only one possibility ( in.l.2 I coach.l.l ) is 
semantic onsistent. 
At this time no sooting is provided for 'how compatible' a group 
of words is, only if  it is semantically consistent or not. 
Pragmatic Consistency 
Because of the above mentioned combinatorial explosion it seems 
to be useful to integrate also at this task-independent stage of the 
analysis ome domain dependent information. 
This pragmatic inforn~tion should be handled with as few effort 
as possible. On the other side the effect as a filter should also be as 
good as possible. What is not intended is to introduce here a first 
structural analysis but to decide whether a group of words 
pragmatically fit together or not, only dependent on special features 
of the words itself. 
For this reason here it is tried to check the pragmatic onsistency 
of groups of words or constituents and give them a pragmatic 
priority. This priority is not a measure for correctness of the 
hypothesis, but determines in which order pragmatically checked 
hypotheses hould be further analyzed. It indicates, whether all 
words of such a group can be interpreted in the same pragmatic 
concept, and how much the set of possible pragmatic oncepts could 
be restricted. 
In our system the pragmatic (task-specific) knowledge is 
represented in a semantic network (Brielzmarm 1984) as is the 
knowledge of the semantic module. The network scheme is 
influenced by the formalism of Stuetured Inheritance Networks 
(Brachman 1978). In this pragmatic network at the time six types of 
information inquiries are modelled. Each of these concepts for an 
inforrmtion type has as attributes the information that is needed to 
find an answer for an inquiry of the user. For example, the concept 
'timetable information' has an attribute 'From time' which specifies 
the range of time during which the departure of the train should be 
(see Fig. 3). This attribute could linguistically be realized for 
example with the word 'tomorrow'.

For many words in the dictionary a possible set of pragmatic 
concepts can be determined. With this property of words for each 
word a pragmatic bitvector pbv(w) is defined. Each bit of such a 
bitvector represents a concept of the pragmatic network. It therefore 
has as its length the number of all concepts (at the time 193). In this 
bitvector a word w has "I" for the following concepts: 
For concepts that could be realized by the word and all 
generalizations of that concept. 
For all concepts and their specializations for which the 
concepts of 1. can be the domain of an attribute. 
If the word belongs to the basic lexicon, i.e. the part of the 
dictionary that is needed for nearly every domain (for 
example pronouns or determiners), it gets the "l" with 
respect o their semantic lass. For this there exists a 
mapping function to pragmatic concepts. For example, 
all such words which belong to the semantic class TIMe 
(as 2. to the concept 'time interval' which could be 
realized by these words. 
In many cases (for example determiners) all bits are set- 
to "l'. 
The pragmatic bitvector of a group of words wl ... wn is then: 
pbv(wl ... v-n) := pbv(wl) AND pbv(w2) ... AND pbv(wn) 
The pragmatic priority pP(wl  ... wn) is defined as the number of 
"1" in pbv(wl ... wn) and has the following properties: 
* If the pragn~tic priority of a group of words = O, then the 
group is pragmatically inconsistent. 
* The smaller the priority the better the hypothesis with these 
words. 
* The bits of the pragn~tic bit'vector determine which pragmatic 
concept and especially which information type was realized. 
To make use of contextually determined expectations about 
the following user utterance the pragmatic interpretation of
groups of words can be restricted with: 
pbv(wl ... wn) AND pbv('timetable information') 
has to be >0 
where pbv('timetable information') is the bitvector for the pragmatic 
concept 'timetable information' and has the "1" only for the concept 
itself. 
An example for pragmatic bitvectors and priorities pP(w) is given in 
Fig. 4. 
3. Scoring 
A nmin problem in reducing the amount of hypotheses for 
further analysis is to find appropriate scores, so that only the 
hypotheses that are 'better' than a special given limit have to be 
regarded further. In the semantic module different ypes of scores 
are used" 
* Reliability scores from the other modules. 
* A score indicating how much of the speech signal is covered by 
the hypothesis. 
* The pragmatic priority. 
* A score indicating how many slots of a case frame are filled. 
For determining this score a function is used that takes into 
account that a hypothesis does not become always more 
probable the more parts of a sentence are realized. Also 
hypotheses built of only short consitutents (i.e. mostly 
pronouns or adverbs) are less probable. 
4, Stages of Semantic Analysis 
At the present time the semantic analysis has three stages. 
To demonstrate he analysis here an English example is chosen. It 
is an invented one for we only analyse Gerrmn spoken speech. In 
Fig. 5 the result of the syntactic analysis is shown: all constituents 
that are one upon another are competing with regard to the speech 
signal. To find sentences covering at least most of the range of the 
speech signal there can be only combined groups of constituents 
together that are not competing to each other. 
4.1 Local Interpretation of Constituents 
A constituent (hypothesized by the syntax module) is checked to 
see whether the selectional restrictions between all of its words are 
observed. Only if this is true (i.e. the constituent is semantically 
consistent), and the constituent is also pragmatically consistent, is it 
regarded for further semantic analysis. 
Selectional restrictions are defined in the lexicon by the attribute 
SELECTION. For the local interpretation all selectional restrictiom 
that are given by some words in a constituent to some others in the 
same constituent have to be proved. There are especially restrictions 
given by words of special word classes which can be combined with 
nouns and can restrict the whole set of nouns to a smaller set by 
semantic means, i.e. the prepositions ( ee the exan-~le of Fig. 2), the 
adjectives or even the numbers. In the above example all 
constituents with a '~" are rejected.

4.2 Pre-S¢lectlon of Groups of H~qpothescs 
The next step is to build up sentences out of the semantic 
consistent constituents. This is not done by the syntax module 
because there exist too many possibilities to combine the syntactic 
constituents o syntactically correct sentences (there exist nearly no 
restrictions that are independent of semantic features). On the other 
hand there is always the difficulty with gain in the speech signal

Fig. 7: The case frame or "to leave" 
found but really spoken words). For this reason this analysis is done 
by the semantic module with additional syntactic knowledge. 
The analysis is based on the valency and case theory. All verbs, 
but also some nouns and adjectives are associated with case frames 
which describe the dependencies between the word itself (i.e. the 
nucleus of the frame) and the constituents with which it could be 
combined. Such a case frame describes also the underlying relational 
structure. The frames are represented in a semantic net (see 
Brielzmann 1984). 
Fig. 7 shows an example. The word "to leave" has one obligatory 
actant with the functional role INSTRUMENT and two optional 
actants (GOAL and OBJECT). Beside the actants there exist the 
adjuncts which could be combined with nearly every verb. In the 
example there is shown only T IME for that is very important for our 
application, the information about intercity trains. There are 
different types of restrictions: 
I. the information if the actant is obligatory or optional 
2. the semantic restriction for the nucleus of the comtituent 
3. the (syntactic) type of the constituent 
4. these are features that exist especially in German: the case of a 
noun group, for prepositional groups a set of prepositions that 
belong to a certain semantic class or a special preposition. 
If only I.) and 2.) is used, at least the in Fig. 8 shown sentences 
could be hypothesized for the example. 
First experiments have shown that it is nearly impossible to use 
only the network formalism for finding sentences because of the 
combinatorial explosion. On the other hand the process of 
instantiation does not cope with the posibility that also the nucleus 
of a case frame will not be found always. Therefore the pre- 
selection isadded to handle these problems. 
The idea is to seek first for groups of constituents which could 
establish a sentence. What should be avoided is that the same group 
of hypotheses is analyzed in several different contexts and that too 
many combinations have to be checked. So the dictionary is 
organized in a way that all acrants of all frames with the same 
serrantic restriction and the same type of constituent are represented 
as one class. These classes are than grouped together to combinations 
which can appear together in at least one case frame. Each 
combination has in addition the information in which case frame it 
can appear.

Fig. 8: Sentence hypotheses 
With this last information a found group of words could also be 
accepted if the nucleus is not found. It is even possible to predict a 
set of nuclei. These could he used as top-down hypotheses for the 
syntax module or the word recognition module. 
For example for "to leave": 
INSTRUMENT--> NG-Tra 
GOAL --> PNG-Loc 
OBJECT --> NG-Con 
The combinations are then: 
(NG-Tra) 
(NG-Tra PNG-Loe) 
(NG-Tra NG-Con) 
(NG-Tra PNG-Loe NG-Con) 
(PNG-Loe NG-Con) 
These combinations do not say anything about sequential order, 
for, in German, word-order is relatively free. The last possibility is 
regarded although such a sentence would he grammatically 
incomplete (the I~UMENT slot is obligatory) to cope with the 
fact that not all uttered words are recognized by the word 
recognition module. To reduce the number of combinations the 
second combination will be eliminated because the class TRAnsport 
is a specialization of CONcrete (see Fig. 1) and the combination is 
then also represented by the last possibility. So there arise 
ambiguities that have to be solved in the last step of the analysis, the 
instantiation of frames. 
I f  this method is applied to a dictionary that cont~in~ all of the 
words used in the above example the result is the following list of 
combinations (instead of 14 possibilities, i f  nothing is drawn 
together): 
(NG-Con) --> go, cost, leave 
(NG-Abs) --> cost, there._is 
(PNG-Loe) --> ticket, train, go 
(PNG-Loe NG-Con) --> go, leave 
(PNG-Loe NG-Tra NG-Lo¢) --> leave 
(NG-Wor Ng-Thi) - -> cost 
During the first stage of the analysis the serramtic consistent 
constituents are sorted to the above used classes (see Fig. 9) so that a 
constituent is attached to all classes with which it is semantically 
compatible and agrees with respect o the constituent type. 
So the problem of finding instances for the above combinations 
reduces to combining each element of the set of hypotheses attached 
to one class to each element of the set of hypotheses attached to the 
second class of the combination, and so on. If one combination 
comprises another, for example (PNG-Lcx:) and (PNG-Loe NG- 
Con), the earlier result is used (the seek is organized as a tree). 
Restrictions for combining are given by the fact that two 
hypotheses cannot he competing with regard to the speech signal and 
by the fact that the found group of words has to he pragmatically 
consistent. 
To complete these groups there is also tried to f'md temporal 
adjuncts to each of them (out of the original group and the so found 
new groups only the best will be furthermore treated as hypotheses). 
As temporal adjuncts there will be used all constituents which are 
compatibal with the semantic class "l'INte and chains of such 
constituents with length of not more than 3 (for example "tomorrow I 
morning", "tomorrow I morning I at 9 o' clock'). Up to now no more 
inforn'ation is used but in the future there will be a module that 
chooses only in the dialog context interpretable chains of temporal 
adjuncts. 
With this second step of semantic analysis in Fig. 8 all sentences 
but 3, 11 and 18 are hypothesized. 3 and 17 are rejected because the 
constituent type is not correct, 11 is not pragmatically compatibal. 
All sententces in Fig. 8 satisfy the semantic restrictions. 
There have been made also experiments that consider in addition 
simple rules of word order. They cannot he very specific because in 
German nearly each word order is allowed, especially in spoken

third of all groups are rejecmd with this criterion (for example the 
sentence 15 in Fig. 8). 
All found groups of hypotheses get the above mentioned scores 
and are ordered with regard to it. 
Results 
The results here presented are based on the following utterances 
(for the conditions of the experiments see also section 4.1): 
246a Welche Verbindung kann ich nelmmn? (Which connection 
should I choose?) 
246b Hat dieser Zug auch einen Speisewagen? (Has this train also a 
dining-car?) 
0250 Ich moechte am Freitng moeglichst frueh in Bonn sein. (I want 
to be at Bonn on Friday as early as possible.) 
5518 Er kostet z.elm Mark. (It costs ten marks). 
5520 Wit mcechten am Wochenende nach Mainz fahren. (We want to 
go to Mainz at the weekend.) 
Fig. 10 shows how many groups Of hypotheses were found 
dependent on the number of word hypotheses per segment in the 
speech signal (each segment represents one phon). The experiments 
here have been made by using as restrictions for the combinations

1. the semantic lasses and the type of the constituents (without

2. the semantic lasses, the type of the constituents and pragmatic 
attributes using the pragmatic bitvectors (with pbv) 
3. the same conditions as in 2., but in addition some word order 
restrictions are checked (word order). 
The really spoken utterances are always found but in soma cases 
with a very bad score with respect o competing hypotheses. The 
main reasons for this result and the often high number of hypotheses 
are: 
* The analysis of the time adjuncts is too less restrictive. 
Therefore in the future there will be only used constituents or 
chains of constituents hat can really be interpreted in the dialog 
context as a time intervall or a special moment. So hypotheses a  
'yesterday I then I tommorow' or 'at nine o' clock I next year' no 
longer are accepted. The referred tirae should also lie in the 
near future (because of our application). 
* Anaphora could fill (nearly) each slot in each frame (similar as 
the constituent 'what' in Fig. 9). On the other hand they are 
often very short. So they appear in many combinations with 
other constituents. For an anaphoric constituent must have a 
referent which it represents (for example the constituent 'it' in 
5518 could possibly refer to 'ticket'), such constituents should

obtain the semantic and pragmatic attributes of the possible 
referents - or, if there are none, should not be regarded for 
future analysis. 
This method will first reduce the number of hypotheses and 
second will improve the score of a sentence with anaphoric 
constituents if it was really spoken (or also if it is well 
interpretable). 
4.3 Structural Interpretation 
The last step consists in trying to instantiate the found candidates 
in the semantic network of the module (Briel2mann 1984 and 1986). 
Here all other selectionfl restrictions (i.e. especially the syntactic 
ones) are checked and thus the amount of hypotheses can be reduced 
a little bit more. Also the ambiguities have to be solved (see above). 
As a result there are gained instances of frame concepts which are 
the input for further domain dependent analysis by the pragmatic 
module. 
This step (the instantiation) now is in work. All others are 
runnable. 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper a semantic analysis for spoken speech is presented. 
The most important additional problem which arises in comparison to 
a written input is the combinatorial explosion due to the many word 
hypotheses produced by the word recognition module. Because of 
this problem one has to cope with many word ambiguities. For 
solving these problems we need scores. 
Problems arise with time adjuncts and anaphora. Also 
hierarchically structured sentences cannot be analyzed with the 
method of pre-selection of groups, for exampl~ 
"Could you please look for the best connection to Hamburg?" 
could look 
J J 
I J 
you for the best connection 
I 
I 
to Hamburg 
Until now two combinations are found but they have bad scores 
because they cover too 1~ of the speech signal. They cannot be 
combined together. 
Could I you I look I for the best connection 
and 
for the best connection I to Hamburg 
It is planned to expand the pre-selection i a way that also this 
problem could be solved. 
The semantic analysis is implemented in LISP at a VAX 11/730.
