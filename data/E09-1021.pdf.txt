Abstract
We present a method which, given a few
words defining a concept in some lan-
guage, retrieves, disambiguates and ex-
tends corresponding terms that define a
similar concept in another specified lan-
guage. This can be very useful for
cross-lingual information retrieval and the
preparation of multi-lingual lexical re-
sources. We automatically obtain term
translations from multilingual dictionaries
and disambiguate them using web counts.
We then retrieve web snippets with co-
occurring translations, and discover ad-
ditional concept terms from these snip-
pets. Our term discovery is based on co-
appearance of similar words in symmetric
patterns. We evaluate our method on a set
of language pairs involving 45 languages,
including combinations of very dissimilar
ones such as Russian, Chinese, and He-
brew for various concepts. We assess the
quality of the retrieved sets using both hu-
man judgments and automatically compar-
ing the obtained categories to correspond-
ing English WordNet synsets.
1 Introduction
Numerous NLP tasks utilize lexical databases that
incorporate concepts (or word categories): sets
of terms that share a significant aspect of their
meanings (e.g., terms denoting types of food, tool
names, etc). These sets are useful by themselves
for improvement of thesauri and dictionaries, and
they are also utilized in various applications in-
cluding textual entailment and question answer-
ing. Manual development of lexical databases is
labor intensive, error prone, and susceptible to
arbitrary human decisions. While databases like
WordNet (WN) are invaluable for NLP, for some
applications any offline resource would not be ex-
tensive enough. Frequently, an application re-
quires data on some very specific topic or on very
recent news-related events. In these cases even
huge and ever-growing resources like Wikipedia
may provide insufficient coverage. Hence appli-
cations turn to Web-based on-demand queries to
obtain the desired data.
The majority of web pages are written in En-
glish and a few other salient languages, hence
most of the web-based information retrieval stud-
ies are done on these languages. However, due
to the substantial growth of the multilingual web1,
queries can be performed and the required infor-
mation can be found in less common languages,
while the query language frequently does not
match the language of available information.
Thus, if we are looking for information about
some lexical category where terms are given in
a relatively uncommon language such as Hebrew,
it is likely to find more detailed information and
more category instances in a salient language such
as English. To obtain such information, we need
to discover a word list that represents the desired
category in English. This list can be used, for in-
stance, in subsequent focused search in order to
obtain pages relevant for the given category. Thus
given a few Hebrew words as a description for
some category, it can be useful to obtain a simi-
lar (and probably more extended) set of English
words representing the same category.
In addition, when exploring some lexical cate-
gory in a common language such as English, it is

frequently desired to consider available resources
from different countries. Such resources are likely
to be written in languages different from English.
In order to obtain such resources, as before, it
would be beneficial, given a concept definition in
English, to obtain word lists denoting the same
concept in different languages. In both cases a
concept as a set of words should be translated as a
whole from one language to another.
In this paper we present an algorithm that given
a concept defined as a set of words in some source
language discovers and extends a similar set in
some specified target language. Our approach
comprises three main stages. First, given a few
terms, we obtain sets of their translations to the tar-
get language from multilingual dictionaries, and
use web counts to select the appropriate word
senses. Next, we retrieve search engine snippets
with the translated terms and extract symmetric
patterns that connect these terms. Finally, we use
these patterns to extend the translated concept, by
obtaining more terms from the snippets.
We performed thorough evaluation for various
concepts involving 45 languages. The obtained
categories were manually verified with two human
judges and, when appropriate, automatically com-
pared to corresponding English WN synsets. In
all tested cases we discovered dozens of concept
terms with state-of-the-art precision.
Our major contribution is a novel framework for
concept translation across languages. This frame-
work utilizes web queries together with dictio-
naries for translation, disambiguation and exten-
sion of given terms. While our framework relies
on the existence of multilingual dictionaries, we
show that even with basic 1000 word dictionaries
we achieve good performance. Modest time and
data requirements allow the incorporation of our
method in practical applications.
In Section 2 we discuss related work, Section 3
details the algorithm, Section 4 describes the eval-
uation protocol and Section 5 presents our results.
2 Related work
Substantial efforts have been recently made to
manually construct and interconnect WN-like
databases for different languages (Pease et al.,
2008; Charoenporn et al., 2007). Some stud-
ies (e.g., (Amasyali, 2005)) use semi-automated
methods based on language-specific heuristics and
dictionaries.
At the same time, much work has been done
on automatic lexical acquisition, and in particu-
lar, on the acquisition of concepts. The two main
algorithmic approaches are pattern-based discov-
ery, and clustering of context feature vectors. The
latter represents word contexts as vectors in some
space and use similarity measures and automatic
clustering in that space (Deerwester et al., 1990).
Pereira (1993), Curran (2002) and Lin (1998) use
syntactic features in the vector definition. (Pantel
and Lin, 2002) improves on the latter by cluster-
ing by committee. Caraballo (1999) uses conjunc-
tion and appositive annotations in the vector rep-
resentation. While a great effort has focused on
improving the computational complexity of these
methods (Gorman and Curran, 2006), they still re-
main data and computation intensive.
The current major algorithmic approach for
concept acquisition is to use lexico-syntactic pat-
terns. Patterns have been shown to produce more
accurate results than feature vectors, at a lower
computational cost on large corpora (Pantel et al.,
2004). Since (Hearst, 1992), who used a manu-
ally prepared set of initial lexical patterns in order
to acquire relationships, numerous pattern-based
methods have been proposed for the discovery of
concepts from seeds (Pantel et al., 2004; Davidov
et al., 2007; Pasca et al., 2006). Most of these
studies were done for English, while some show
the applicability of their method to some other
languages including Russian, Greek, Czech and
French.
Many papers directly target specific applica-
tions, and build lexical resources as a side ef-
fect. Named Entity Recognition can be viewed
as an instance of the concept acquisition problem
where the desired categories contain words that
are names of entities of a particular kind, as done
in (Freitag, 2004) using co-clustering and in (Et-
zioni et al., 2005) using predefined pattern types.
Many Information Extraction papers discover re-
lationships between words using syntactic patterns
(Riloff and Jones, 1999).
Unlike in the majority of recent studies where
the acquisition framework is designed with spe-
cific languages in mind, in our task the algorithm
should be able to deal well with a wide variety
of target languages without any significant manual
adaptations. While some of the proposed frame-
works could potentially be language-independent,
little research has been done to confirm it yet.
176
There are a few obstacles that may hinder apply-
ing common pattern-based methods to other lan-
guages. Many studies utilize parsing or POS tag-
ging, which frequently depends on the availabil-
ity and quality of language-specific tools. Most
studies specify seed patterns in advance, and it is
not clear whether translated patterns can work well
on different languages. Also, the absence of clear
word segmentation in some languages (e.g., Chi-
nese) can make many methods inapplicable.
A few recently proposed concept acquisition
methods require only a handful of seed words
(Davidov et al., 2007; Pasca and Van Durme,
2008). While these studies avoid some of the ob-
stacles above, it still remains unconfirmed whether
such methods are indeed language-independent.
In the concept extension part of our algorithm we
adapt our concept acquisition framework (Davi-
dov and Rappoport, 2006; Davidov et al., 2007;
Davidov and Rappoport, 2008a; Davidov and
Rappoport, 2008b) to suit diverse languages, in-
cluding ones without explicit word segmentation.
In our evaluation we confirm the applicability of
the adapted methods to 45 languages.
Our study is related to cross-language infor-
mation retrieval (CLIR/CLEF) frameworks. Both
deal with information extracted from a set of lan-
guages. However, the majority of CLIR stud-
ies pursue different targets. One of the main
CLIR goals is the retrieval of documents based
on explicit queries, when the document lan-
guage is not the query language (Volk and Buite-
laar, 2002). These frameworks usually develop
language-specific tools and algorithms including
parsers, taggers and morphology analyzers in or-
der to integrate multilingual queries and docu-
ments (Jagarlamudi and Kumaran, 2007). Our
goal is to develop and evaluate a language-
independent method for the translation and exten-
sion of lexical categories. While our goals are dif-
ferent from CLIR, CLIR systems can greatly ben-
efit from our framework, since our translated cate-
gories can be directly utilized for subsequent doc-
ument retrieval.
Another field indirectly related to our research
is Machine Translation (MT). Many MT tasks re-
quire automated creation or improvement of dic-
tionaries (Koehn and Knight, 2001). However,
MT mainly deals with translation and disambigua-
tion of words at the sentence or document level,
while we translate whole concepts defined inde-
pendently of contexts. Our primary target is not
translation of given words, but the discovery and
extension of a concept in a target language when
the concept definition is given in some different
source language.
3 Cross-lingual Concept Translation
Framework
Our framework has three main stages: (1) given
a set of words in a source language as definition
for some concept, we automatically translate them
to the target language with multilingual dictionar-
ies, disambiguating translations using web counts;
(2) we retrieve from the web snippets where these
translations co-appear; (3) we apply a pattern-
based concept extension algorithm for discovering
additional terms from the retrieved data.
3.1 Concept words and sense selection
We start from a set of words denoting a category
in a source language. Thus we may use words
like (apple, banana, ...) as the definition of fruits
or (bear, wolf, fox, ...) as the definition of wild
animals2. Each of these words can be ambiguous.
Multilingual dictionaries usually provide many
translations, one or more for each sense. We need
to select the appropriate translation for each term.
In practice, some or even most of the category
terms may be absent in available dictionaries.
In these cases, we attempt to extract “chain”
translations, i.e., if we cannot find Source?Target
translation, we can still find some indirect
Source?Intermediate1?Intermediate2?Target
paths. Such translations are generally much
more ambiguous, hence we allow up to two
intermediate languages in a chain. We collect all
possible translations at the chains having minimal
length, and skip category terms for whom this
process results in no translations.
Then we use the conjecture that terms of the
same concept tend to co-appear more frequently
than ones belonging to different concepts3. Thus,
2In order to reduce noise, we limit the length (in words)
of multiword expressions considered as terms. To calculate
this limit for a language we randomly take 100 terms from
the appropriate dictionary and set a limit as Limmwe =
round(avg(length(w))) where length(w) is the number of
words in term w. For languages like Chinese without inherent
word segmentation, length(w) is the number of characters in
w. While for many languages Limmwe = 1, some languages
like Vietnamese usually require two words or more to express
terms.
3Our results in this paper support this conjecture.
177
we select a translation of a term co-appearing
most frequently with some translation of a differ-
ent term of the same concept. We estimate how
well translations of different terms are connected
to each other. Let C = {Ci} be the given seed
words for some concept. Let Tr(Ci, n) be the
n-th available translation of word Ci and Cnt(s)
denote the web count of string s obtained by a
search engine. Then we select translation Tr(Ci)
according to:
F (w1, w2) =
Cnt(“w1 ? w2”)× Cnt(“w2 ? w1”)
Cnt(w1)× Cnt(w2)
Tr(Ci) =
argmax
si
(
max
sj
j 6=i
(F (Tr(Ci, si), T r(Cj , sj)))
)
We utilize the Y ahoo! “x * y” wildcard that al-
lows to count only co-appearances where x and y
are separated by a single word. As a result, we ob-
tain a set of disambiguated term translations. The
number of queries in this stage depends on the am-
biguity of concept terms translation to the target
language. Unlike many existing disambiguation
methods based on statistics obtained from parallel
corpora, we take a rather simplistic query-based
approach. This approach is powerful (as shown
in our evaluation) and only relies on a few web
queries in a language independent manner.
3.2 Web mining for translation contexts
We need to restrict web mining to specific tar-
get languages. This restriction is straightforward
if the alphabet or term translations are language-
specific or if the search API supports restriction to
this language4. In case where there are no such
natural restrictions, we attempt to detect and add
to our queries a few language-specific frequent
words. Using our dictionaries, we find 1–3 of the
15 most frequent words in a desired language that
are unique to that language, and we ‘and’ them
with the queries to ensure selection of the proper
language. While some languages as Esperanto do
not satisfy any of these requirements, more than
60 languages do.
For each pair A, B of disambiguated term trans-
lations, we construct and execute the following 2
queries: {“A * B”, “B * A”}5. When we have
3 or more terms we also add {A B C . . .}-like
conjunction queries which include 3–5 terms. For
languages with Limmwe > 1, we also construct
4Yahoo! allows restrictions for 42 languages.
5These are Yahoo! queries where enclosing words in “”
means searching for an exact phrase and “*” means a wild-
card for exactly one arbitrary word.
queries with several “*” wildcards between terms.
For each query we collect snippets containing text
fragments of web pages. Such snippets frequently
include the search terms. Since Y ahoo! allows re-
trieval of up to the 1000 first results (100 in each
query), we collect several thousands snippets. For
most of the target languages and categories, only a
few dozen queries (20 on the average) are required
to obtain sufficient data. Thus the relevant data
can be downloaded in seconds. This makes our
approach practical for on-demand retrieval tasks.
3.3 Pattern-based extension of concept terms
First we extract from the retrieved snippets con-
texts where translated terms co-appear, and de-
tect patterns where they co-appear symmetrically.
Then we use the detected patterns to discover ad-
ditional concept terms. In order to define word
boundaries, for each target language we manu-
ally specify boundary characters such as punctu-
ation/space symbols. This data, along with dic-
tionaries, is the only language-specific data in our
framework.
3.3.1 Meta-patterns
Following (Davidov et al., 2007) we seek symmet-
ric patterns to retrieve concept terms. We use two
meta-pattern types. First, a Two-Slot pattern type
constructed as follows:
[Prefix] C1 [Infix] C2 [Postfix]
Ci are slots for concept terms. We allow up to
Limmwe space-separated6 words to be in a sin-
gle slot. Infix may contain punctuation, spaces,
and up to Limmwe × 4 words. Prefix and Post-
fix are limited to contain punctuation characters
and/or Limmwe words.
Terms of the same concept frequently co-appear
in lists. To utilize this, we introduce two additional
List pattern types7:
[Prefix] C1[Infix] (Ci[Infix])+ (1)
[Infix] (Ci[Infix])+ Cn [Postfix] (2)
As in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and
Rappoport, 2006), we define a pattern graph.
Nodes correspond to terms and patterns to edges.
If term pair (w1, w2) appears in pattern P , we add
nodes Nw1 , Nw2 to the graph and a directed edge
EP (Nw1 , Nw2) between them.
6As before, for languages without explicit space-based
word separation Limmwe limits the number of characters in-
stead.
7(X)+ means one or more instances of X .
178
3.3.2 Symmetric patterns
We consider only symmetric patterns. We define
a symmetric pattern as a pattern where some cate-
gory terms Ci, Cj appear both in left-to-right and
right-to-left order. For example, if we consider the
terms {apple, pineapple} we select a List pattern
“(one Ci, )+ and Cn.” if we find both “one apple,
one pineapple, one guava and orange.” and “one
watermelon, one pineapple and apple.”. If no such
patterns are found, we turn to a weaker definition,
considering as symmetric those patterns where the
same terms appear in the corpus in at least two dif-
ferent slots. Thus, we select a pattern “for C1 and
C2” if we see both “for apple and guava,” and “for
orange and apple,”.
3.3.3 Retrieving concept terms
We collect terms in two stages. First, we obtain
“high-quality” core terms and then we retrieve po-
tentially more noisy ones. In the first stage we col-
lect all terms8 that are bidirectionally connected to
at least two different original translations, and call
them core concept terms Ccore. We also add the
original ones as core terms. Then we detect the
rest of the terms Crest that appear with more dif-
ferent Ccore terms than with ‘out’ (non-core) terms
as follows:
Gin(c)={w?Ccore|E(Nw, Nc) ? E(Nc, Nw)}
Gout(c)={w/?Ccore|E(Nw, Nc) ? E(Nc, Nw)}
Crest={c| |Gin(c)|>|Gout(c)| }
where E(Na, Nb) correspond to existence of a
graph edge denoting that translated terms a and b
co-appear in a pattern in this order. Our final term
set is the union of Ccore and Crest.
For the sake of simplicity, unlike in the ma-
jority of current research, we do not attempt to
discover more patterns/instances iteratively by re-
examining the data or re-querying the web. If we
have enough data, we use windowing to improve
result quality. If we obtain more than 400 snip-
pets for some concept, we randomly divide the
data into equal parts, each containing up to 400
snippets. We apply our algorithm independently
to each part and select only the words that appear
in more than one part.
4 Experimental Setup
We describe here the languages, concepts and dic-
tionaries we used in our experiments.
8We do not consider as terms the 50 most frequent words.
4.1 Languages and categories
One of the main goals in this research is to ver-
ify that the proposed basic method can be applied
to different languages unmodified. We examined
a wide variety of languages and concepts. Table
3 shows a list of 45 languages used in our experi-
ments, including west European languages, Slavic
languages, Semitic languages, and diverse Asian
languages.
Our concept set was based on English WN
synsets, while concept definitions for evaluation
were based on WN glosses. For automated evalua-
tion we selected as categories 150 synsets/subtrees
with at least 10 single-word terms in them. For
manual evaluation we used a subset of 24 of these
categories. In this subset we tried to select generic
categories, such that no domain expert knowledge
was required to check their correctness.
Ten of these categories were equal to ones used
in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rap-
poport, 2006), which allowed us to indirectly
compare to recent work. Table 1 shows these 10
concepts along with the sample terms. While the
number of tested categories is still modest, it pro-
vides a good indication for the quality of our ap-
proach.
Concept Sample terms
Musical instruments guitar, flute, piano
Vehicles/transport train, bus, car
Academic subjects physics, chemistry, psychology
Body parts hand, leg, shoulder
Food egg, butter, bread
Clothes pants, skirt, jacket
Tools hammer, screwdriver, wrench
Places park, castle, garden
Crimes murder, theft, fraud
Diseases rubella, measles, jaundice
Table 1: 10 of the selected categories with sample terms.
4.2 Multilingual dictionaries
We developed a set of tools for automatic access
to several dictionaries. We used Wikipedia cross-
language links as our main source (60%) for of-
fline translation. These links include translation
of Wikipedia terms into dozens of languages. The
main advantage of using Wikipedia is its wide cov-
erage of concepts and languages. However, one
problem in using it is that it frequently encodes too
specific senses and misses common ones. Thus
bear is translated as family Ursidae missing its
common “wild animal” sense. To overcome these
179
difficulties, we also used Wiktionary and comple-
mented these offline resources with a few auto-
mated queries to several (20) online dictionaries.
We start with Wikipedia definitions, then if not
found, Wiktionary, and then we turn to online dic-
tionaries.
5 Evaluation and Results
While there are numerous concept acquisition
studies, no framework has been developed so far
to evaluate this type of cross-lingual concept dis-
covery, limiting our ability to perform a meaning-
ful comparison to previous work. Fair estimation
of translated concept quality is a challenging task.
For most languages there are no widely accepted
concept databases. Moreover, the contents of the
same concept may vary across languages. Fortu-
nately, when English is taken as a target language,
the English WN allows an automated evaluation of
concepts. We conducted evaluation in three differ-
ent settings, mostly relying on human judges and
utilizing the English WN where possible.
1. English as source language. We applied our
algorithm on a subset of 24 categories using
each of the 45 languages as a target language.
Evaluation is done by two judges9.
2. English as target language. All other lan-
guages served as source languages. In this
case human subjects manually provided in-
put terms for 150 concept definitions in each
of the target languages using 150 selected
English WN glosses. For each gloss they
were requested to provide at least 2 terms.
Then we ran the algorithm on these term
lists. Since the obtained results were English
words, we performed both manual evaluation
of the 24 categories and automated compari-
son to the original WN data.
3. Language pairs. We created 10 different non-
English language pairs for the 24 concepts.
Concept definitions were the same as in (2)
and manual evaluation followed the same
protocol as in (1).
The absence of exhaustive term lists makes recall
estimation problematic. In all cases we assess the
quality of the discovered lists in terms of precision
(P ) and length of retrieved lists (T ).
9For 19 of the languages, at least one judge was a native
speaker. For other languages at least one of the subjects was
fluent with this language.
5.1 Manual evaluation
Each discovered concept was evaluated by two
judges. All judges were fluent English speakers
and for each target language, at least one was a flu-
ent speaker of this language. They were given one-
line English descriptions of each category and the
full lists obtained by our algorithm for each of the
24 concepts. Table 2 shows the lists obtained by
our algorithm for the category described as Rela-
tives (e.g., grandmother) for several language pairs
including Hebrew?French and Chinese?Czech.
We mixed “noise” words into each list of terms10.
These words were automatically and randomly ex-
tracted from the same text. Subjects were re-
quired to select all words fitting the provided de-
scription. They were unaware of algorithm details
and desired results. They were instructed to ac-
cept common abbreviations, alternative spellings
or misspellings like yel
¯
ow?color and to accept a
term as belonging to a category if at least one
of its senses belongs to it, like orange?color and
orange?fruit. They were asked to reject terms re-
lated or associated but not belonging to the target
category, like tasty/?food, or that are too general,
like animal/?dogs.
The first 4 columns of Table 3 show averaged
results of manual evaluation for 24 categories. In
the first two columns English is used as a source
language and in the next pair of columns English is
used as the target. In addition we display in paren-
theses the amount of terms added during the ex-
tension stage. We can see that for all languages,
average precision (% of correct terms in concept)
is above 80, and frequently above 90, and the aver-
age number of extracted terms is above 30. Inter-
nal concept quality is in line with values observed
on similarly evaluated tasks for recent concept ac-
quisition studies in English. As a baseline, only
3% of the inserted 20-40% noise words were in-
correctly labeled by judges. Due to space limita-
tion we do not show the full per-concept behavior;
all medians for P and T were close to the average.
We can also observe that the majority (> 60%)
of target language terms were obtained during the
extension stage. Thus, even when considering
translation from a rich language such as English
(where given concepts frequently contain dozens
of terms), most of the discovered target language
terms are not discovered through translation but
10To reduce annotator bias, we used a different number of
noise words, adding 20–40% of the original number of words.

during the subsequent concept extension. In fact,
brief examination shows that less than half of
source language terms successfully pass transla-
tion and disambiguation stage. However, more
than 80% of terms which were skipped due to lack
of available translations were re-discovered in the
target language during the extension stage, along
with the discovery of new correct terms not exist-
ing in the given source definition.
The first two columns of Table 4 show similar
results for non-English language pairs. We can see
that these results are only slightly inferior to the
ones involving English.
5.2 WordNet based evaluation
We applied our algorithm on 150 concepts with
English used as the target language. Since we
want to consider common misspellings and mor-
phological combinations of correct terms as hits,
we used a basic speller and stemmer to resolve
typos and drop some English endings. The WN
columns in Table 3 display P and T values for
this evaluation. In most cases we obtain > 85%
precision. While these results (P=87,T=17) are
lower than in manual evaluation, the task is much
harder due to the large number (and hence sparse-
ness) of the utilized 150 WN categories and the
incomplete nature of WN data. For the 10 cat-
egories of Table 1 used in previous work, we
have obtained (P=92,T=41) which outperforms
the seed-based concept acquisition of (Widdows
and Dorow, 2002; Davidov and Rappoport, 2006)
(P=90,T=35) on the same concepts. However, it
should be noted that our task setting is substan-
tially different since we utilize more seeds and
they come from languages different from English.
5.3 Effect of dictionary size and source
category size
The first stage in our framework heavily relies on
the existence and quality of dictionaries, whose
coverage may be insufficient. In order to check
the effect of dictionary coverage on our task, we
re-evaluated 10 language pairs using reduced dic-
tionaries containing only the 1000 most frequent
words. The last columns in Table 4 show evalu-
ation results for such reduced dictionaries. Sur-
prisingly, while we see a difference in coverage
and precision, this difference is below 8%, thus
even basic 1000-word dictionaries may be useful
for some applications.
This may suggest that only a few correct trans-
lations are required for successful discovery of
the corresponding category. Hence, even a small
dictionary containing translations of the most fre-
quent terms could be enough. In order to test
this hypothesis, we re-evaluated the 10 language
pairs using full dictionaries while reducing the
initial concept definition to the 3 most frequent
words. The results of this experiment are shown at
columns 3–4 of Table 4. We can see that for most
language pairs, 3 seeds were sufficient to achieve
equally good results, and providing more exten-
sive concept definitions had little effect on perfor-
mance.
5.4 Variance analysis
We obtained high precision. However, we also ob-
served high variance in the number of terms be-
tween different language pairs for the same con-
cept. There are many possible reasons for this out-
come. Below we briefly discuss some of them; de-
tailed analysis of inter-language and inter-concept
variance is a major target for future work.
Web coverage of languages is not uniform (Pao-
lillo et al., 2005); e.g. Georgian has much less
web hits than English. Indeed, we observed a cor-
relation between reported web coverage and the
number of retrieved terms. Concept coverage and

Morphology was completely neglected in this
research. To co-appear in a text, terms frequently
have to be in a certain form different from that
shown in dictionaries. Even in English, plurals
like spoons, forks co-appear more than spoon,
fork. Hence dictionaries that include morphol-
ogy may greatly improve the quality of our frame-
work. We have conducted initial experiments with
promising results in this direction, but we do not
report them here due to space limitations.
6 Conclusions
We proposed a framework that when given a set
of terms for a category in some source language
uses dictionaries and the web to retrieve a similar
category in a desired target language. We showed
that the same pattern-based method can success-
fully extend dozens of different concepts for many
languages with high precision. We observed that
even when we have very few ambiguous transla-
tions available, the target language concept can
be discovered in a fast and precise manner with-
out relying on any language-specific preprocess-
ing, databases or parallel corpora. The average
concept total processing time, including all web
requests, was below 2 minutes11. The short run-
ning time and the absence of language-specific re-
quirements allow processing queries within min-
utes and makes it possible to apply our method to
on-demand cross-language concept mining.
