Abstract
Microblogs have recently received
widespread interest from NLP re-
searchers. However, current tools for
Japanese word segmentation and POS
tagging still perform poorly on microblog
texts. We developed an annotated corpus
and proposed a joint model for over-
coming this situation. Our annotated
corpus of microblog texts enables not
only training of accurate statistical models
but also quantitative evaluation of their
performance. Our joint model with lexical
normalization handles the orthographic
diversity of microblog texts. We con-
ducted an experiment to demonstrate
that the corpus and model substantially
contribute to boosting accuracy.
1 Introduction
Microblogs, such as Twitter1 and Weibo2, have re-
cently become an important target of NLP tech-
nology. Since microblogs offer an instant way of
posting textual messages, they have been given
increasing attention as valuable sources for such
actions as mining opinions (Jiang et al., 2011)
and detecting sudden events such as earthquake
(Sakaki et al., 2010).
However, many studies have reported that cur-
rent NLP tools do not perform well on microblog
texts (Foster et al., 2011; Gimpel et al., 2011). In
the case of Japanese text processing, the most se-
rious problem is poor accuracy of word segmen-
tation and POS tagging. Since these two tasks
are positioned as the fundamental step in the text
processing pipeline, their accuracy is vital for all
downstream applications.

1.1 Development of annotated corpus
The main obstacle that makes word segmentation
and POS tagging in the microblog domain chal-
lenging is the lack of annotated corpora. Because
current annotated corpora are from other domains,
such as news articles, it is difficult to train models
that perform well on microblog texts. Moreover,
system performance cannot be evaluated quantita-
tively.
We remedied this situation by developing an an-
notated corpus of Japanese microblogs. We col-
lected 1831 sentences from Twitter and manually
annotated these sentences with word boundaries,
POS tags, and normalized forms of words (c.f.,
Section 1.2).
We, for the first time, present a comprehen-
sive empirical study of Japanese word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging on microblog texts by us-
ing this corpus. Specifically, we investigated how
well current models trained on existing corpora
perform in the microblog domain. We also ex-
plored performance gains achieved by using our
corpus for training, and by jointly performing lex-
ical normalization (c.f., Section 1.2).
1.2 Joint modeling with lexical normalization
Orthographic diversity in microblog texts causes a
problem when training a statistical model for word
segmentation and POS tagging. Microblog texts
frequently contain informal words that are spelled
in a non-standard manner, e.g., “oredi (already)”,
“b4 (before)”, and “talkin (talking)” (Han and
Baldwin, 2011). Such words, hereafter referred
to as ill-spelled words, are so productive that they
considerably increase the vocabulary size. This
makes training of statistical models difficult.
We address this problem by jointly conducting
lexical normalization. Although a wide variety
of ill-spelled words are used in microblog texts,
many can be normalized into well-spelled equiva-
lents, which conform to standard rules of spelling.
99
A joint model with lexical normalization is able
to handle orthographic diversity by exploiting in-
formation obtainable from the well-spelled equiv-
alents.
The proposed joint model was empirically eval-
uated on the microblog corpus we developed. Our
experiment demonstrated that the proposed model
can perform word segmentation and POS tag-
ging substantially better than current state-of-the-
art models.
1.3 Summary
Contributions of this paper are the following:
• We developed a microblog corpus that en-
ables not only training of accurate models but
also quantitative evaluation for word segmen-
tation and POS tagging in the microblog do-
main.3
• We propose a joint model with lexical nor-
malization for better handling of ortho-
graphic diversity in microblog texts. In par-
ticular, we present a new method of training
the joint model using a partially annotated
corpus (c.f., Section 7.4).
• We, for the first time, present a comprehen-
sive empirical study of word segmentation
and POS tagging for microblogs. The experi-
mental results demonstrated that both the mi-
croblog corpus and joint model greatly con-
tributes to training accurate models for word
segmentation and POS tagging.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3
discusses the task of lexical normalization and in-
troduces terminology. Section 4 presents our mi-
croblog corpus and results of our corpus analysis.
Section 5 presents an overview of our joint model
with lexical normalization, and Sections 6 and 7
provide details of the model. Section 8 presents
experimental results and discussions, and Section
9 presents concluding remarks.
2 Related Work
Researchers have recently developed various mi-
croblog corpora annotated with rich linguistic in-
formation. Gimpel et al. (2011) and Foster et
al. (2011) annotated English microblog posts with
3Please contact the first author for this corpus.
POS tags. Han and Baldwin (2011) released a mi-
croblog corpus annotated with normalized forms
of words. A Chinese microblog corpus annotated
with word boundaries was developed for SIGHAN
bakeoff (Duan et al., 2012). However, there are
no microblog corpora annotated with word bound-
aries, POS tags, and normalized sentences.
There has been a surge of interest in lexical nor-
malization with the advent of microblogs (Han and
Baldwin, 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Han et al., 2012;
Wang and Ng, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Ling et
al., 2013; Yang and Eisenstein, 2013; Wang et al.,
2013). However, these studies did not address en-
hancing word segmentation.
Wang et al. (2013) proposed a method of joint
ill-spelled word recognition and word segmenta-
tion. With their method, informal spellings are
merely recognized and not normalized. Therefore,
they did not investigate how to exploit the infor-
mation obtainable from well-spelled equivalents
to increase word segmentation accuracy.
Some studies also explored integrating the lexi-
cal normalization process into word segmentation
and POS tagging (Ikeda et al., 2009; Sasano et al.,
2013). A strength of our joint model is that it uses
rich character-level and word-level features used
in state-of-the-art models of joint word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging (Kudo et al., 2004; Neubig
et al., 2011; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013). Thanks
to these features, our model performed much bet-
ter than Sasano et al.’s system, which is the only
publicly available system that jointly conducts lex-
ical normalization, in the experiments (see Section
8). Another advantage is that our model can be
trained on a partially annotated corpus. Further-
more, we present a comprehensive evaluation in
terms of precision and recall on our microblog cor-
pus. Such an evaluation has not been conducted in
previous work due to the lack of annotated cor-
pora.4
3 Lexical Normalization Task
This section explains the task of lexical normal-
ization addressed in this paper. Since lexical nor-
malization is a relatively new research topic, there
are no precise definitions of a lexical normaliza-
tion task that are widely accepted by researchers.
4Very recently, Saito et al. (2014) conducted similar em-
pirical evaluation on microblog corpus. However, they used
biased dataset, in which every sentence includes at least one
ill-spelled words.

and their well-spelled equivalents. Phonemes are
shown between slashes. English translations are

Ill-spelled word Well-spelled equivalent
??? /sugee/ ??? /sugoi/ (great)
?? /modoro/ ??? /modorou/ (going to return)
?????? /umaiiii/ ??? /umai/ (yummy)
Therefore, it is important to clarify our task setting
before discussing our joint model.
3.1 Target ill-spelled words
Many studies on lexical normalization have
pointed out that phonological factors are deeply
involved in the process of deriving ill-spelled
words. Xia et al. (2006) investigated a Chi-
nese chat corpus and reported that 99.2% of the
ill-spelled words were derived by phonetic map-
ping from well-spelled equivalents. Wang and
Ng (2013) analyzed 200 Chinese messages from
Weibo and 200 English SMS messages from the
NUS SMS corpus (How and Kan, 2005). Their
analysis revealed that most ill-spelled words were
derived from well-spelled equivalents based on
pronunciation similarity.
On top of these investigations, we focused on
ill-spelled words that are derived by phonologi-
cal mapping from well-spelled words by assum-
ing that such ill-spelled words are dominant in
Japanese microblogs as well. We also assume
that these ill-spelled words can be normalized into
well-spelled equivalents on a word-to-word basis,
as assumed in a previous study (Han and Baldwin,
2011). The validity of these two assumptions is
empirically assessed in Section 4.
Table 1 lists examples of our target ill-spelled
words, their well-spelled equivalents, and their
phonemes. The ill-spelled word in the first row
is formed by changing the continuous two vowels
from /oi/ to /ee/. This type of change in pronun-
ciation is often observed in Japanese spoken lan-
guage. The second row presents contractions. The
last vowel character “?” /u/ of the well-spelled
word is dropped. The third row illustrates word
lengthening. The ill-spelled word is derived by re-
peating the vowel character “?” /i/.
3.2 Terminology
We now introduce the terminology that will be
used throughout the remainder of this paper. The
term word surface form (or surface form for short)
is used to refer to the word form observed in an
actual text, while word normal form (or normal
form) refers to the normalized word form. Note
that surface forms of well-spelled words are al-
ways identical to their normal forms.
It is possible that the word surface form and nor-
mal form have distinct POS tags, although they are
identical in most cases. Take the ill-spelled word “
??” /modoro/ as an example (the second row of
Table 1). According to the JUMAN POS tag set,5
POS of its surface form is CONTRACTED VERB,
while that of its normal form is VERB.6 To handle
such a case, we strictly distinguish between these
two POS tags by referring to them as surface POS
tags and normal POS tags, respectively.
Given these terms, the tasks addressed in this
paper can be stated as follows. Word segmenta-
tion is a task of segmenting a sentence into a se-
quence of word surface forms, and POS tagging
is a task of providing surface POS tags. The task
of joint lexical normalization, word segmentation,
and POS tagging is to map a sentence into a se-
quence of quadruplets: word surface form, surface
POS tag, normal form, and normal POS tag.
4 Microblog Corpus
This section introduces our microblog corpus. We
first explain the process of developing the corpus
then present the results of our agreement study and
corpus analysis.
4.1 Data collection and annotation
The corpus was developed by manually annotating
text messages posted to Twitter.
The posts to be annotated were collected as fol-
lows. 171,386 Japanese posts were collected using
the Twitter API7 on December 6, 2013. Among
these, 1000 posts were randomly selected then
manually split into sentences. As a result, we ob-
tained 1831 sentences as a source of the corpus.
Two human participants annotated the 1831
sentences with surface forms and surface POS
tags. Since much effort has already been done to
annotate corpora with this information, the anno-
tation process here follows the guidelines used to
5http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/index.php?JUMAN
6In this paper, we use simplified POS tags for explana-
tion purposes. Remind that these tags are different from the
original ones defined in JUMAN POS tag set.

101
develop such corpora in previous studies (Kuro-
hashi and Nagao, 1998; Hashimoto et al., 2011).
The two participants also annotated ill-spelled
words with their normal forms and normal POS
tags. Although this paper targets only infor-
mal phonological variations (c.f., Section 3),
other types of ill-spelled words were also anno-
tated to investigate their frequency distribution
in microblog texts. Specifically, besides infor-
mal phonological variations, spelling errors and
Twitter-specific abbreviations were annotated. As
a result, 833 ill-spelled words were identified (Ta-
ble 2). They were all annotated with normal forms
and normal POS tags.
4.2 Agreement study
We investigated the inter-annotator agreement to
check the reliability of the annotation. During the
annotation process, the two participants collabo-
ratively annotated around 90% of the sentences
(specifically, 1647 sentences) with normal forms
and normal POS tags, and elaborated an annota-
tion guideline through discussion. They then inde-
pendently annotated the remaining 184 sentences
(1431 words), which were used for the agreement
study. Our annotation guideline is shown in the
supplementary material.
We first explored the extent to which the
two participants agreed in distinguishing between
well-spelled words and ill-spelled words. For this
task, we observed Cohen’s kappa of 0.96 (almost
perfect agreement). This results show that it is
easy for humans to distinguish between these two
types of words.
Next, we investigated whether the two partici-
pants could give ill-spelled words with the same
normal forms and normal POS tags. For this pur-
pose, we regarded the normal forms and normal
POS tags annotated by one participant as goldstan-
dards and calculated precision and recall achieved
by the other participant. We observed moder-
ate agreement between the two participants: 70%
(56/80) precision and 73% (56/76) recall. We
manually analyzed the conflicted examples and
found that there were more than one acceptable
normal form in many of these cases. Therefore,
we would like to note that the precision and recall
reported above are rather pessimistic estimations.
4.3 Analysis
We conducted corpus analysis to confirm the fea-
sibility of our approach.
Table 2: Frequency distribution over three types of
ill-spelled words in corpus.
Type Frequency
Informal phonological variation 804 (92.9%)
Spelling error 27 (3.1%)
Twitter-specific abbreviation 34 (3.9%)
Total 865 (100%)
Table 2 illustrates that phonological variations
constitute a vast majority of ill-spelled words in
Japanese microblog texts. In addition, analysis
of the 804 phonological variations showed that
793 of them can be normalized into single words.
These represent the validity of the two assump-
tions we made in Section 3.1.
We then investigated whether lexical normaliza-
tion can decrease the number of out-of-vocabulary
words. For the 793 ill-spelled words, we counted
how many of their surface forms and normal
forms were not registered in the JUMAN dictio-
nary.8 The result suggests that 411 (51.8%) and
74 (9.3%) are not registered in the dictionary. This
indicates the effectiveness of lexical normalization
for decreasing out-of-vocabulary words.
5 Overview of Joint Model
This section gives an overview of our joint model
with lexical normalization for accurate word seg-
mentation and POS tagging.
5.1 Lattice-based approach
A lattice-based approach has been commonly
adopted to perform joint word segmentation and
POS tagging (Jiang et al., 2008; Kudo et al., 2004;
Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013). In this approach, an
input sentence is transformed into a word lattice
in which the edges are labeled with surface POS
tags (Figure 1). Given such a lattice, word seg-
mentation and POS tagging can be performed at
the same time by traversing the lattice. A discrim-
inative model is typically used for the traversal.
An advantage of this approach is that, while the
lattice can represent an exponentially large num-
ber of candidate analyses, it can be quickly tra-
versed using dynamic programming (Kudo et al.,
2004; Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013) or beam search
(Jiang et al., 2008). In addition, a discriminative
model allows the use of rich word-level features
to find the correct analysis.

Figure 2: Lattice used to perform joint task. Nor-
mal forms and normal POS tags are shown in
parentheses. As indicated by dotted arrows, nor-
malized sentence can be obtained by concatenat-
ing normal forms associated with edges in correct
analysis.
We propose extending the lattice-based ap-
proach to jointly perform lexical normalization,
word segmentation, and POS tagging. We trans-
form an input sentence into a word lattice in which
the edges are labeled with not only surface POS
tags but normal forms and normal POS tags (Fig-
ure 2). By traversing such a lattice, the three
tasks can be performed at the same time. This ap-
proach can not only exploit rich information ob-
tainable from word normal forms, but also achieve
efficiency similar to the original lattice-based ap-
proach.
5.2 Issues
Issues on how to develop this lattice-based ap-
proach is detailed in Sections 6 and 7.
Section 6 describes how to generate a word lat-
tice from an input sentence. This is done us-
ing a hybrid approach that combines a statistical
model and normalization dictionary. The normal-
ization dictionary is specifically a list of quadru-
Table 3: Normalization dictionary. Columns rep-
resent entry ID, surface form, surface POS, normal
form, and normal POS, respectively.

plets: word surface form, surface POS tag, normal
form, and normal POS tag (Table 3).
Section 7 describes a discriminative model for
the lattice traversal. Our feature design as well as
two training methods are presented.
6 Word Lattice Generation
In this section, we first describe a method of con-
structing a normalization dictionary then present a
method of generating a word lattice from an input
sentence.
6.1 Construction of normalization dictionary
Although large-scale normalization dictionaries
are difficult to obtain, tag dictionaries, which list
pairs of word surface forms and their surface POS
tags (Table 4), are widely available in many lan-
guages including Japanese. Therefore, we use an
existing tag dictionary to construct the normaliza-
tion dictionary.
Due to space limitations, we give only a brief
overview of our construction method, omitting its
details. We note that our method uses hand-crafted
rules similar to those used in (Sasano et al., 2013);
hence, the proposal of this method is not an im-
portant contribution. To make our experimental
results reproducible, our normalization dictionary,
as well as a tool for constructing it, is released as
supplementary material.
Our method of constructing the normalization
dictionary takes three steps. The following ex-
plains each step using Tables 3 and 4 as running
examples.
103
Step 1 A tag dictionary generally contains a
small number of ill-spelled words, although well-
spelled words constitute a vast majority. We iden-
tify such ill-spelled words by using a manually-
tailored list of surface POS tags indicative of in-
formal spelling (e.g., CONTRACTED VERB). For
example, entry (c) in Table 4 is identified as an
ill-spelled word in this step.
Step 2 The tag dictionary is augmented with
normal forms and normal POS tags to construct
a small normalization dictionary. For ill-spelled
words identified in step 1, the normal forms and
normal POS tags are determined by hand-crafted
rules. For example, the normal form is derived by
appending the vowel character “?” /u/ to the sur-
face form, if the surface POS tag is CONTRACTED
VERB. This rule derives entry (D) in Table 3 from
entry (c) in Table 4. For well-spelled words, on
the other hand, the normal forms and normal POS
tags are simply set the same as the surface forms
and surface POS tags. For example, entries (A),
(C), and (E) in Table 3 are generated from entries
(a), (b), and (d) in Table 4, respectively.
Step 3 Because the normalization dictionary
constructed in step 2 contains only a few ill-
spelled words, it is expanded in this step. For this
purpose, we use hand-crafted rules to derive ill-
spelled words from the entries already registered
in the normalization dictionary. Some rules are
taken from (Sasano et al., 2013), while the others
are newly tailored. In Table 3, for example, entry
(B) is derived from entry (A) by applying the rule
that substitutes “??” /goi/ with “??” /gee/.
A small problem that arises in step 3 is how to
handle lengthened words, such as entry (F) in Ta-
ble 3. While lengthened words can be easily de-
rived using simple rules (Brody and Diakopoulos,
2011; Sasano et al., 2013), such rules infinitely
increase the number of entries because an unlim-
ited number of lengthened words can be derived
by repeating characters. To address this problem,
no lengthened words are added to the normaliza-
tion dictionary in step 3. We instead use rules
to skip repetitive characters in an input sentence
when performing dictionary match.
6.2 A hybrid approach
A word lattice is generated using both a statisti-
cal method (Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013) and the
normalization dictionary.
We begin by generating a word lattice which en-
codes only word surface forms and surface POS
tags (c.f., Figure 1) using the statistical method
proposed by Kaji and Kitsuregawa (2013). Inter-
ested readers may refer to their paper for details.
Each edge in the lattice is then labeled with nor-
mal forms and normal POS tags. Note that a sin-
gle edge can have more than one candidate normal
form and normal POS tag. In such a case, new
edges are accordingly added to the lattice.
The edges are labeled with normal forms and
normal POS tags in the following manner. First,
every edge is labeled with a normal form and
normal POS tag that are identical with the sur-
face form and surface POS tag. This is based on
our observation that most words are well-spelled
ones. The edge is not provided with further nor-
mal forms and normal POS tags, if the normaliza-
tion dictionary contains a well-spelled word that
has the same surface form as the edge. Otherwise,
we allow the edge to have all pairs of normal forms
and normal POS tags that are obtained by using the
normalization dictionary.
7 Discriminative Lattice Traversal
This section explains a discriminative model for
traversing the word lattice. The lattice traversal
with a discriminative model can formally be writ-
ten as
(w, t,v, s) = argmax
(w,t,v,s)?L(x)
f(x,w, t,v, s) · ?.
Here, x denotes an input sentence, w, t, v, and s
denote a sequence of word surface forms, surface
POS tags, normal forms, and normal POS tags, re-
spectively, L(x) represents a set of candidate anal-
yses represented by the word lattice, and f(·) and
? are feature and weight vectors.
We now describe features, a decoding method,
and two training methods.
7.1 Features
We use character-level and word-level features
used for word segmentation and POS tagging in
(Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013). To take advan-
tage of joint model with lexical normalization, the
word-level features are extracted from not only
surface forms but also normal forms. See (Kaji
and Kitsuregawa, 2013) for the original features.
In addition, several new features are introduced
in this paper. We use the quadruplets (w
i
, t
i
, v
i
, s
i
)
104
and pairs of surface and normal POS tags (t
i
, s
i
)
as binary features to capture probable mappings
between ill-spelled words and their well-spelled
equivalents. We use another binary feature indi-
cating whether a quadruplet (w
i
, t
i
, v
i
, s
i
) is reg-
istered in the normalization dictionary. Also, we
use a bigram language model feature, which pre-
vents sentences from being normalized into un-
grammatical and/or incomprehensible ones. The
language model features are associated with nor-
malized bigrams, (v
i?1
, s
i?1
, v
i
, s
i
), and take as
the values the logarithmic frequency log
10
(f +1),
where f represents the bigram frequency (Kaji and
Kitsuregawa, 2011). Since it is difficult to obtain
a precise value of f , it is approximated by the fre-
quency of the surface bigram, (w
i?1
, t
i?1
, w
i
, t
i
),
calculated from a large raw corpus automatically
analyzed using a system of joint word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging. See Section 8.1 for the raw
corpus and system used in the experiments.
7.2 Decoding
It is easy to find the best analysis (w, t,v, s)
among the candidates represented by the word lat-
tice. Although we use several new features, we
can still locate the best analysis by using the same
dynamic programming algorithm as in previous
studies (Kudo et al., 2004; Kaji and Kitsuregawa,
2013).
7.3 Training on a fully annotated corpus
It is straightforward to train the joint model pro-
vided with a fully annotated corpus, which is la-
beled with word surface forms, surface POS tags,
normal forms, and normal POS tags.
We use structured perceptron (Collins, 2002)
for the training (Algorithm 1). The training be-
gins by initializing ? as a zero vector (line 1).
It then reads the annotated corpus C (line 2-9).
Given a training example, (x,w, t,v, s) ? C, the
algorithm locates the best analysis, ( ˆw, ˆt, ˆv, ˆs),
based on the current weight vector (line 4). If
the best analysis differs from the oracle analy-
sis, (w, t,v, s), the weight vector is updated (line
5-7). After going through the annotated corpus

eration motivates us to explore training our model
with less supervision. We specifically explore us-
ing a corpus annotated with only word boundaries
and POS tags.
We use the latent perceptron algorithm (Sun et
al., 2013) to train the joint model from such a par-
tially annotated corpus (Algorithm 2). In this sce-
nario, a training example is a sentence x paired
with a sequence of word surface forms w and sur-
face POS tags t (c.f., line 3). Similarly to the
perceptron algorithm, we locate the best analy-
sis ( ˆw, ˆt, ˆv, ˆs) for a given training example, (line
4). We also locate the best analysis, (w, t, ¯v, ¯s),
among those having the same surface forms w and
surface POS tags t as the training example (line
5). If the surface forms and surface POS tags of
the former analysis differ from the annotations of
the training example, parameter is updated by re-
garding the latter analysis as an oracle (line 6-8).
8 Experiments
We conducted experiments to investigate how the
microblog corpus and joint model contribute to
improving accuracy of word segmentation and
POS tagging in the microblog domain.
8.1 Setting
We constructed the normalization dictionary from
the JUMAN dictionary 7.0.9 While JUMAN dic-
9http://nlp.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/index.php?JUMAN
105
tionary contains 750,156 entries, the normaliza-
tion dictionary contains 112,458,326 entries.
Some features taken from the previous study
(Kaji and Kitsuregawa, 2013) are induced using a
tag dictionary. For this we used two tag dictionar-
ies. One is JUMAN dictionary 7.0 and the other
is a tag dictionary constructed by listing surface
forms and surface POS tags in the normalization
dictionary.
To compute the language model features, one
billion sentences from Twitter posts were analyzed
using MeCab 0.996.10 We used all bigrams ap-
pearing at least 10 times in the auto-analyzed sen-
tences.
8.2 Results of word segmentation and POS
tagging
We first investigated the performance of models
trained on an existing annotated corpus form news
texts. For this experiment, our joint model as
well as three state-of-the-art models (Kudo et al.,
2004)11(Neubig et al., 2011)12(Kaji and Kitsure-
gawa, 2013) were trained on Kyoto University
Text corpus 4.0 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998).
Since this training corpus is not annotated with
normal forms and normal POS tags, our model
was trained using the latent perceptron. Table
5 summarizes the word-level F
1
-scores (Kudo et
al., 2004) on our microblog corpus. The two
columns represent the results for word segmenta-
tion (Seg) and joint word segmentation and POS
tagging (Seg+Tag), respectively.
We also conducted 5-fold crossvalidation on
our microblog corpus to evaluate performance im-
provement when these models are trained on mi-
croblog texts (Table 6). In addition to the models
in Table 5, results of a rule-based system (Sasano
et al., 2013)13 and our joint model trained using
the perceptron algorithm are also presented. No-
tice that Proposed and Proposed (latent) repre-
sent our model trained using perceptron and latent
perceptron, respectively.
From Tables 5 and 6, as expected, we see that
the models trained on news texts performed poorly
on microblog texts, while their performance sig-
nificantly boosted when trained on the microblog
texts. This demonstrates the importance of corpus
annotation. An exception was Kudo04. Its perfor-

mance improved only slightly, even when it was
trained on the microblog texts. We believe this is
because their model uses dictionary-based rules to
prune candidate analyses; thus, it could not per-
form well in the microblog domain, where out-of-
vocabulary words are abundant.
Table 6 also illustrates that our joint models
achieved F
1
-score better than the state-of-the-art
models trained on the microblog texts. This
shows that modeling the derivation process of ill-
spelled words makes training easier. We con-
ducted bootstrap resampling (with 1000 samples)
to investigate the significance of the improvements
achieved with our joint model. The results showed
that all improvements over the baselines were sta-
tistically significant (p < 0.01). The difference
between Proposed and Proposed (latent) were
also statistically significant (p < 0.01).
The results of Proposed (latent) are interest-
ing. Table 5 illustrates that our joint model per-
forms well even when it is trained on a news cor-
pus that rarely contains ill-spelled words and is
not at all annotated with normal forms and nor-
mal POS tags. This indicates the robustness of our
training method and the importance of modeling
word derivation process in the microblog domain.
In Table 6, we observed that Proposed (latent),
which uses less supervision, performed better than
Proposed. The reason for this will be examined
later.
In summary, we can conclude that both the mi-
croblog corpus and joint model significantly con-
tribute to training accurate models for word seg-
mentation and POS tagging in the microblog do-
main.
8.3 Results of lexical normalization
While the main goal with this study was to en-
hance word segmentation and POS tagging in the
microblog domain, it is interesting to explore how
well our joint model can normalize ill-spelled
words.
Table 7 illustrates precision, recall, and F

the results into context, we report on the baseline
results of a tagging model proposed by Neubig et
al. (2011). This baseline conducts lexical normal-
ization by regarding it as two independent tagging
tasks (i.e., tasks of tagging normal forms and nor-
mal POS tags). The result of the baseline model is
also obtained using 5-fold crossvalidation.
Table 7 illustrates that Proposed performed sig-
nificantly better than the simple tagging model,
Neubig11. This suggests the effectiveness of our
joint model. On the other hand, Proposed (latent)
performed poorly in this task. From this result, we
can argue that Proposed (latent) can achieve su-
perior performance in word segmentation and POS
tagging (Table 6) because it gave up correctly nor-
malizing ill-spelled words, focusing on word seg-
mentation and POS tagging.
The experimental results so far suggest the fol-
lowing strategy for training our joint model. If ac-
curacy of word segmentation and POS tagging is
the main concern, we can use the latent percep-
tron. This approach has the advantage of being
able to use a partially annotated corpus. On the
other hand, if performance of lexical normaliza-
tion is crucial, we have to use the standard percep-
tron algorithm.
8.4 Error analysis
We manually analyzed erroneous outputs and ob-
served several tendencies.
We found that a word lattice sometimes missed
the correct output. Such an error was, for example,
observed in a sentence including many ill-spelled
words, e.g., ‘????????????? (be
nervous about what other people think!)’, where
the part ‘??????’ is in ill-spelled words.
Improving the lattice generation algorithm is con-
sidered necessary to achieve further performance
gain.
Even if the correct analysis appears in the word
lattice, our model sometimes failed to handle
ill-spelled words, incorrectly analyzing them as
out-of-vocabulary words. For example, the pro-
posed method treated the phrase ‘???????
(snack time)’ as a single out-of-vocabulary word,
even though the correct analysis was found in the
word lattice. More sophisticated features would
be required to accurately distinguish between ill-
spelled and out-of-vocabulary words.
9 Conclusion and Future Work
We presented our attempts towards developing an
accurate model for word segmentation and POS
tagging in the microblog domain. To this end, we,
for the first time, developed an annotated corpus
of microblogs. We also proposed a joint model
with lexical normalization to handle orthographic
diversity in the microblog text. Intensive exper-
iments demonstrated that we could successfully
improve the performance of word segmentation
and POS tagging on microblog texts. We believe
this study will have a large practical impact on a
various research areas that target microblogs.
One limitation of our approach is that it cannot
handle certain types of ill-spelled words. For ex-
ample, the current model cannot handle the cases
in which there are no one-to-one-mappings be-
tween well-spelled and ill-spelled words. Also,
our model cannot handle spelling errors, which
are considered relatively frequent in the microblog
than news domains. The treatment of these prob-
lems would require further research.
Another future research is to speed-up our
model. Since the joint model with lexical normal-
ization significantly increases the search space,
it is much slower than the original lattice-based
model for word segmentation and POS tagging.
