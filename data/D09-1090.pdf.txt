Abstract 
Bilingual dictionaries are vital resources in 
many areas of natural language processing. 
Numerous methods of machine translation re-
quire bilingual dictionaries with large cover-
age, but less-frequent language pairs rarely 
have any digitalized resources. Since the need 
for these resources is increasing, but the hu-
man resources are scarce for less represented 
languages, efficient automatized methods are 
needed. This paper introduces a fully auto-
mated, robust pivot language based bilingual 
dictionary generation method that uses the 
WordNet of the pivot language to build a new 
bilingual dictionary. We propose the usage of 
WordNet in order to increase accuracy; we 
also introduce a bidirectional selection method 
with a flexible threshold to maximize recall. 
Our evaluations showed 79% accuracy and 
51% weighted recall, outperforming represen-
tative pivot language based methods. A dic-
tionary generated with this method will still 
need manual post-editing, but the improved 
recall and precision decrease the work of hu-
man correctors. 
1 Introduction 
In recent decades automatic and semi-automatic 
machine translation systems gradually managed 
to take over costly human tasks. This much wel-
comed change can be attributed not only to major 
developments in techniques regarding translation 
methods, but also to important translation re-
sources, such as monolingual or bilingual dic-
tionaries and corpora, thesauri, and so on. How-
ever, while widely used language pairs can fully 
take advantage of state-of-the-art developments 
in machine translation, certain low-frequency, or 
less common language pairs lack some or even 
most of the above mentioned translation re-
sources. In that case, the key to a highly accurate 
machine translation system switches from the 
choice and adaptation of the translation method 
to the problem of available translation resources 
between the chosen languages. 
One possible solution is bilingual corpus ac-
quisition for statistical machine translation 
(SMT). However, for highly accurate SMT sys-
tems large bilingual corpora are required, which 
are rarely available for less represented lan-
guages. Rule or sentence pattern based systems 
are an attractive alternative, for these systems the 
need for a bilingual dictionary is essential. 
Our paper targets bilingual dictionary genera-
tion, a resource which can be used within the 
frameworks of a rule or pattern based machine 
translation system. Our goal is to provide a low-
cost, robust and accurate dictionary generation 
method. Low cost and robustness are essential in 
order to be re-implementable with any arbitrary 
language pair. We also believe that besides high 
precision, high recall is also crucial in order to 
facilitate post-editing which has to be performed 
by human correctors. For improved precision, we 
propose the usage of WordNet, while for good 
recall we introduce a bidirectional selection 
method with local thresholds. 
Our paper is structured as follows: first we 
overview the most significant related works, af-
ter which we analyze the problems of current 
dictionary generation methods. We present the 
details of our proposal, exemplified with the 
Japanese-Hungarian language pair. We evaluate 
the generated dictionary, performing also a com-
parative evaluation with two other pivot-
language based methods. Finally we present our 
conclusions. 
2 Related works 
2.1 Bilingual dictionary generation 
Various corpus based, statistical methods with 
very good recall and precision were developed 
starting from the 1980’s, most notably using the 
862
Dice-coefficient (Kay & Röscheisen, 1993), cor-
respondence-tables (Brown, 1997), or mutual 
information (Brown et al., 1998).  
As an answer to the corpus-based method’s 
biggest disadvantage, namely the need for a large 
bilingual corpus, in the 1990’s Tanaka and 
Umemura (1994) presented a new approach. As a 
resource, they only use dictionaries to and from a 
pivot language to generate a new dictionary. 
These so-called pivot language based methods 
rely on the idea that the lookup of a word in an 
uncommon language through a third, intermedi-
ated language can be automated. Tanaka and 
Umemura’s method uses bidirectional source-
pivot and pivot-target dictionaries (harmonized 
dictionaries). Correct translation pairs are se-
lected by means of inverse consultation, a 
method that relies on counting the number of 
pivot language definitions of the source word, 
through which the target language definitions can 
be identified (Tanaka and Umemura, 1994).  
Sjöbergh (2005) also presented an approach to 
pivot language based dictionary generation. 
When generating his English pivoted Swedish-
Japanese dictionary, each Japanese-to-English 
description is compared with each Swedish-to-
English description. Scoring is based on word 
overlap, weighted with inverse document fre-
quency; the best matches being selected as trans-
lation pairs.  
These two approaches described above are the 
best performing ones that are general enough to 
be applicable with other language pairs as well. 
In our research we used these two methods as 
baselines for comparative evaluation.  
There are numerous refinements of the above 
methods, but for various reasons they cannot be 
implemented with any arbitrary language pair. 
Shirai and Yamamoto (2001) used English to 
design a Korean-Japanese dictionary, but be-
cause the usage of language-specific information, 
they conclude that their method ‘can be consid-
ered to be applicable to cases of generating 
among languages similar to Japanese or Korean 
through English’. In other cases, only a small 
portion of the lexical inventory of the language is 
chosen to be translated: Paik et al. (2001) pro-
posed a method with multiple pivots (English 
and Kanji/Hanzi characters) to translate Sino-
Korean entries. Bond and Ogura describe a Japa-
nese-Malay dictionary that uses a novel tech-
nique in its improved matching through normali-
zation of the pivot language, by means of seman-
tic classes, but only for nouns (2007). Besides 
English, they also use Chinese as a second pivot.  
2.2 Lexical database in lexical acquisition 
Large lexical databases are vital for many areas 
in natural language processing (NLP), where 
large amount of structured linguistic data is 
needed. The appearance of WordNet (Miller et 
al., 1990) had a big impact in NLP, since not 
only did it provide one of the first wide-range 
collections of linguistic data in electronic format, 
but it also offered a relatively simple structure 
that can be implemented with other languages as 
well. In the last decades since the first, English 
WordNet, numerous languages adopted the 
WordNet structure, thus creating a potential large 
multilingual network. The Japanese language is 
one of the most recent ones added to the Word-
Net family (Isahara et al. 2008), but the Hungar-
ian WordNet is still under development 
(Prószéky et al. 2001; Miháltz and Prószéky 
2004). 
Multilingual projects, such as EuroWordNet 
(Vossen 1998; Peters et al. 1998), Balkanet 
(Stamou et al. 2002) or Multilingual Central Re-
pository (Agirre et al. 2007) aim to solve numer-
ous problems in natural language processing. 
EuroWordNet was specifically designed for 
word disambiguation purposes in cross-language 
information retrieval (Vossen 1998). The internal 
structure of the multilingual WordNets itself can 
be a good starting point for bilingual dictionary 
generation. In case of EuroWordNet, besides the 
internal design of the initial WordNet for each 
language, an Inter-Lingual-Index interlinks word 
meaning across languages is implemented (Pe-
ters et al. 1998). However, there are two limita-
tions: first of all, the size of each individual lan-
guage database is relatively small (Vossen 1998), 
covering only the most frequent words in each 
language, thus not being sufficient for creating a 
dictionary with a large coverage. Secondly, these 
multilingual databases cover only a handful of 
languages, with Hungarian or Japanese not being 
part of them. Adding a new language would re-
quire the existence of a WordNet of that lan-
guage.  
3 Problems of current pivot language 
based methods 
3.1 Selection method shortcomings 
Previous pivot language based methods generate 
and score a number of translation candidates, and 
the candidate’s scores that exceed a certain pre-
defined global threshold are selected as viable 
translation pairs. However, the scores highly de-
863
pend on the entry itself or the number of transla-
tions in the pivot language, therefore there is a 
variance in what that score represents. For this 
reason, a large number of good entries are en-
tirely left out from the dictionary, because all of 
their translation candidates scored low, while 
faulty translation candidates are selected, be-
cause they exceed the global threshold. Due to 
this effect the recall value drops significantly. 
3.2 Dictionaries not enough as resource 
Regardless of the language pair, in most cases 
the meanings of the corresponding words are not 
identical; they only overlap to a certain extent. 
Therefore, the pivot language based dictionary 
generation problem can be defined as the identi-
fication of the common elements or the extent of 
the relevant overlapping in the source-to-pivot 
and target-to-pivot definitions.  
Current methods perform a strictly lexical 
overlap of the source-pivot and target-pivot en-
tries. Even if the meanings of the source and tar-
get head words are transferred to the pivot lan-
guage, this is rarely done with the same set of 
words or definitions. Thus, due to the different 
word-usage or paraphrases, even semantically 
identical or very similar head words can have 
different definitions in different dictionaries. As 
a result, performing only lexical overlap, current 
methods cannot identify the differences between 
totally different definitions resulted by unrelated 
concepts, and differences in only nuances re-
sulted by lexicographers describing the same 
concept, but with different words.  
4 Proposed method 
4.1 Specifics of our proposal 
For higher precision, instead of the familiar lexi-
cal overlap of the current methods we calculate 
the semantically expanded lexical overlap of the 
source-to-pivot and target-to-pivot translations. 
In order to do that, we use semantic information 
extracted from the WordNet of the pivot lan-
guage. 
To improve recall, we introduce bidirectional 
selection. As we stated above, the global thresh-
old eliminates a large number of good translation 
pairs, resulting in a low recall. As a solution, we 
can group the translations that share the same 
source or target entry, and set local thresholds 
for each head word. For example, for a source 
language head word entry_source there could be 
multiple target language candidates:  en-
try_target1, … ,entry_targetn. If the top scoring 
entry_targetk candidates are selected, we ensure 
that at least one translation will be available for 
entry_source, maintaining a high recall. Since we 
can group the entries in the source language and 
target language as well, we perform this selection 
twice, once in each direction. Local thresholds 
depend on the top scoring entry_target, being set 
to maxscore·c. Constant c varies between 0 and 1, 
allowing a small window not only for the maxi-
mum, but high scoring candidates as well. It is 
language and selection method dependent (see 
§5.1 for details). 
4.2 Translation resources 
As an example of a less-common language pair, 
we have chosen Japanese and Hungarian. For 
translation candidate generation, we have chosen 
two freely available dictionaries with English as 
the pivot language. The Japanese-English dic-
tionary had 197282, while the Hungarian-English 
contained 189331 1-to-1 entry pairs. The Japa-
nese-English dictionary had part-of-speech 
(POS) information as well, but to ensure robust-
ness, our method does not use this information.  
To select from the translation candidates, we 
mainly use WordNet (Miller et. al., 1990). From 
WordNet we consider four types of information: 
sense categorization, synonymy, antonymy and 
semantic categories provided by the tree struc-
ture of nouns and verbs.  
4.3 Dictionary generation method 
Our proposed method consists of two steps. In 
step 1 we generate a number of translation pair 
candidates, while in step 2 we score and select 
from them based on semantic information ex-
tracted from WordNet.  
Step 1: translation candidate generation 
Using the source-pivot and pivot-target diction-
aries, we connect the source and target entries 
that share at least one common translation in the 
pivot language. We consider each source-target 
pair a translation candidate. With our Japanese-
English and English-Hungarian dictionaries we 
accumulated 436966 Japanese-Hungarian trans-
lation candidates. 
Step 2: translation pair selection 
We examine the translation candidates one by 
one, looking up the source-pivot and target-pivot 
dictionaries, comparing the translations in the 
pivot language. There are six types of transla-
tions that we label A-F and explain below. First, 
864
we perform a strictly lexical match based only on 
the dictionaries. Next, using information ex-
tracted from WordNet we attempt to identify the 
correct translation pairs.     
(a) Lexically unambiguous translation pairs 
Some of the translation candidates have exactly 
the same translations into in the pivot language; 
we consider these pairs as being correct by de-
fault. Also among the translation candidates we 
identified a number of source entries that had 
only one target translation; and a number of tar-
get entries that had only one source translation. 
Being the sole candidates for the given entries, 
we consider these pairs too as being correct. 
37391 Japanese-Hungarian translation pairs were 
retrieved with this method (type A pairs). 
(b) Using sense description 
For most polysemous words WordNet has de-
tailed descriptions with synonyms for each sense. 
We use these synonyms of WordNet’s sense de-
scriptions to disambiguate the meanings of the 
common translations. For a given source-target 
translation candidate (s,t) we look up the source-
pivot and target-pivot translations 
(s?I={s?i1,…,s?in} and 
t?I={t?i1,…,t?im}). We select the elements 
that are common in the two definitions 
(I’=(s?I)?(t?I)) and we look up their respec-
tive senses from WordNet (sns(I’)). We identify 
the words’ senses comparing each synonym in 
the WordNet’s synonym description with each 
word from the dictionary definition. As a result, 
for each common word we arrive at a certain set 
of senses from the source-pivot definitions 
(sns((s?I’)) and a certain set of senses from the 
target-pivot definitions (sns((t?I’)). We mark 
scoreB(s,t) the maximum ratio of the identical 
and total number of identified senses (Jaccard 
coefficient). The higher the scoreB(s,t) is, the 
more probable is candidate (s,t) a valid transla-
tion.

 (1) 
For example, ?? (seikai: correct, right, cor-
rect interpretation) and helyes (correct, proper, 
right, appropriate) have two common transla-
tions (I’={right, correct}), thus scoreB(s,t) can be 
performed with these two words. The adjective 
right has 13 senses according to WordNet, 
among them 4 were identified from the Japanese 
to English definition (sns(right)={#1, #3, #5, 
#10}, all identified through correct) and 5 from 
the Hungarian to English definition 
(sns(right)={#1, #3, #5, #6, #10}, through cor-
rect or proper). As a result, 4 senses are com-
mon, and 1 is different. Thus the adjective right’s 
score is 0.8 (scoreB(s,t)[right](??,helyes)). The 
adjective correct has 4 senses, all of them are 
recognized by both definitions through right, 
therefore the score through correct is 1 
(scoreB(s,t)[correct](?? ,helyes)). The maxi-
mum of the above scores is the final score: 
scoreB(s,t)(??,helyes)=1. 
All translation candidates are verified based 
on all four POS available from WordNet. Since 
synonymy information is available for nouns (N), 
verbs (V), adjectives (A) and adverbs (R), four 
separate scores are calculated for each POS. 
Scores that pass a global threshold are consid-
ered correct. 33971 Japanese-Hungarian candi-
dates (type B translations) were selected, with 
these two languages the global threshold was set 
to 0.1. Even this low value ensures that at least 
one of ten meanings is shared by the two entries 
of the pair, thus being suitable as translation pair. 
(c) Using synonymy, antonymy and semantic 
categories 
We expand the source-to-pivot and target-to-
pivot definitions with information from WordNet 
(synonymy, antonymy and semantic category, 
respectively). Thus the similarity of the two ex-
panded pivot language descriptions gives a better 
indication on the suitability of the translation 
candidate. Using the three relations, the common 
versus total number of translations (Jaccard coef-
ficient) will define the appropriateness of the 
translation candidate.

Since the same word or concept’s translations 
into the pivot language also share the same se-
mantic value, the extension with synonyms 
(ext(l?i)=(l?i)?syn(l?i), where l={s,t}) the 
extended translation should share more common 
elements.  
In case of antonymy, we expand the initial 
definitions with the antonyms of the antonyms 
(ext(l?i)=(l?i)?ant(ant(l?i)), where l={s,t}). 
This extension is different from the synonymy 
extension, in most cases the resulting set of 
words being considerably larger. 
Along with synonymy, antonymy is also avail-
able for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, 
four separate scores are calculated for each POS. 
865
Semantic categories are provided by the tree 
structure (hypernymy/hyponymy) of nouns and 
verbs of WordNet. We transpose each entry from 
the pivot translations to its semantic categories 
(ext(l?i)=?semcat(l?i), where l={s,t}). We as-
sume that the correct translation pairs share a 
high percentage of semantic categories. Accord-
ingly, the translations of semantically similar or 
identical entries should share a high number of 
common semantic categories. 
The scores based on these relations highly de-
pend on the number of pivot language transla-
tions; therefore we use the bidirectional selection 
method with local thresholds for each source and 
target head word. Local thresholds are set based 
on the best scoring candidate for a given entry. 
The thresholds were maxscore·0.9 for synonymy 
and antonymy; and maxscore·0.8 for the seman-
tic categories (see §5.1 for details). 
Using synonymy, 196775 candidate pairs 
(type C), with antonymy 99614 pairs (type D); 
while with semantic categories 195480 pairs 
(type E) were selected. 
(d) Combined semantic information 
The three separate lists of type C, D and E selec-
tion methods resulted in slightly different results, 
proving that they cannot be used as standalone 
selection methods (see §5.2 for details). 
Because of the multiple POS labelling of nu-
merous words in WordNet, many translation 
pairs can be selected up to four times based on 
separate POS information (noun, verb, adjective, 
adverb), all within one single semantic informa-
tion based methods. Since we use a bidirectional 
selection method, experiments showed that trans-
lation pairs that were selected during both direc-
tions, in most cases were the correct translations. 
Similarly, translation pairs selected during only 
one direction were less accurate. In other words, 
translation pairs whose target language transla-
tion was selected as a good translation for the 
source language entry; and whose source lan-
guage translation was also selected as a good 
translation for the target language entry, should 
be awarded with a higher score. In the same way, 
entries selected only during one direction should 
receive a penalty. For every translation candidate 
we select the maximum score from the several 
POS (noun, verb, adjective and adverb for syn-
onymy and antonymy relations; noun and verb 
for semantic category) based scores, multiplied 
by a multiplication factor (mfactor). The multi-
plication factor varies between 0 and 1, awarding 
the candidates that were selected both times dur-
ing the double directional selection; and punish-
ing when selection was made only in a single 
direction. The product gives the combined score 
(scoreF), c1, c2 and c3 are constants. In case of 
Japanese and Hungarian, these method scored 
best with the constants set to 1, 0.5 and 0.8, re-
spectively. The combined score also highly de-
pends on the word entry, therefore local thresh-
olds are used in this selection method as well, 
which were empirically set to maxscore·0.85 (see 
§5.1 for details).

As an example, for the Japanese entry ?? 
(k?ny?: buy, purchase) there are 10 possible 
Hungarian translations; using the above methods 
5 of them (#1, #7, #8, #9, #10) are selected as 
correct ones. Among these, only 1 of them (#1) 
is a correct translation, the rest have similar or 
totally different meanings. However, with the 
combined scores the faulty translations were 
eliminated and a new, correct, but previously

161202 translation pairs were retrieved with 
this method (type F).  
During pre-evaluation type A and type B trans-
lations received a score of above 75%, while type 
C, type D and type E scored low (see §5.2 for 
details). However, type F translations scored 
close to 80%, therefore from the six translation 
methods presented above we chose only three 
(type A, B and F) to construct the dictionary, 
while the remaining three methods (type C, D 
and E) are used only indirectly for type F selec-
tion. 
With the described selection methods 187761 
translation pairs, with 48973 Japanese and 44664 
Hungarian unique entries was generated. 
5 Threshold settings and pre-evaluation 
5.1 Local threshold settings 
As development set we considered all translation 
candidates whose Hungarian entry starts with 
“zs” (IPA: ?). We assume that the behaviour of 
this subset of words reflects the behaviour of the 
entire vocabulary. 133 unique entries totalling 
515 translation candidates comprise this devel-
opment set. After this, we manually scored the 
515 translation candidates as correct (the transla-
tion conveys the same meaning, or the meanings 
are slightly different, but in a certain context the 
translation is possible) or wrong (the translation 
pair’s two entries convey a different meaning). 
The scoring was performed by one of the authors 
who is a native Hungarian and fluent in Japanese. 
273 entries were marked as correct. Next, we 
experimented with a number of thresholds to de-
termine which ones provide with the best F-
scores (Table 2). The F-scores were determined 
as follows: for example using synonymy infor-
mation (type C) in case of threshold=0.85%, 343 
of the 515 translation pairs were above the 
threshold. Among these, 221 were marked as 
correct by our manual evaluator, thus the preci-
sion being 221/343·100=64.43 and the recall be-
ing 221/273·100=80.95. F-score is the harmonic 
mean of precision and recall (71.75 in this case).

5.2 Selection method evaluation 
As a pre-evaluation of the above selection meth-
ods, we randomly selected 200 1-to-1 source-
target entries resulted by each method. The same 
evaluator scored the translation pairs as correct 
(the translation conveys the same meaning, or the 
meanings are slightly different, but in a certain 
context the translation is possible), undecided 
(the translation pair’s semantic value is similar, 
but a translation based on them would be faulty) 
or wrong (the translation pair’s two entries con-
vey a different meaning).

Table 3: Selection type evaluation 
The results showed that type A and type B selec-
tions scored higher than all order-based selec-
tions, with type C, type D and type E selections 
failing to deliver the desired accuracy (Table 3). 
6 Evaluation 
We performed three types of evaluation: 
(1) frequency-weighted recall evaluation 
(2) 1-to-1 entry precision evaluation 
(3) 1-to-multiple entry evaluation 
For comparative purposes we also performed 
each type of evaluation for two other pivot lan-
guage based methods whose characteristics per-
mit to be implementable with virtually any lan-
guage pair. In order to do so, we constructed two 
other Hungarian-Japanese dictionaries using the 
methods proposed by Tanaka & Umemura and 
Sjöbergh, using the same source dictionaries.  
6.1 Recall evaluation 
It is well known that one of the most challenging 
aspects of dictionary generation is word ambigu-
ity. It is relatively easy to automatically generate 
the translations of low-frequency keywords, be-
cause they tend to be less ambiguous. On the 
contrary, the ambiguity of the high frequency 
words is much higher than their low-frequency 
counterparts, and as a result conventional meth-
ods fail to translate a considerable number of 
them. However, this discrepancy is not reflected 
in the traditional recall evaluation, since each 
867
word has an equal weight, regardless of its fre-
quency of use. As a result, we performed a fre-
quency weighted recall evaluation. We used a 
Japanese frequency dictionary (FD) generated 
from the Japanese EDR corpus (Isahara, 2007) to 
weight each Japanese entry. Setting the standard 
to the frequency dictionary (its recall value being 
100), we automatically search for each entry (w) 
from the frequency dictionary, looking whether 
or not it is included in the bilingual dictionary 
(WD). If it is recalled, we weight it with its fre-
quency from the frequency dictionary.

The frequency weighted recall value results 
show that our method’s dictionary (51.68) out-
scores every other automatically generated 
method’s dictionary (37.03, 30.76) with a sig-
nificant advantage. Moreover, it maintains the 
score of the initial translation candidates, there-
fore managing to maximize the recall value, ow-
ing to the bidirectional selection method with 
local thresholds. However, the recall value of a 
manually created Japanese-English dictionary is 
higher than any automatically generated diction-
ary’s value (Table 4). 
6.2 1-to-1 precision evaluation 
With 1-to-1 precision evaluation we determine 
the translation accuracy of our method, com-
pared with the two baseline methods. 200 ran-
dom pairs were selected from each of the three 
Hungarian-Japanese dictionaries, scoring them 
manually the same way as with selection type 
evaluation (correct, undecided, wrong) (Table 5). 
The manual scoring was performed by one of the 
authors, who is a native Hungarian and fluent in 
Japanese. Since no independent evaluator was 
available for these two languages, after a random 
identification code being assigned to each of the 
600 selected translation pairs (200 from each 
dictionary), they were mixed. Therefore the 
evaluator did not know the origin of the transla-
tion pairs, only after manual scoring the total 
score for each dictionary was available, after re-
grouping based on the initial identification codes. 
The process was repeated 10 times, 2000 pairs 
were manually checked from each dictionary.

To rank the methods we only consider the cor-
rect translations. Our method performed best 
with an average of 79.15%, outscoring Tanaka 
method’s 62.50% and Sjöbergh method’s 
54.05% (Table 6). The maximum deviance of the 
correct translations during the 10 repetitions was 
less than 3% from the average. 
6.3 1-to-multiple evaluation 
While with 1-to-1 precision evaluation we esti-
mated the accuracy of the translation pairs, with 
1-to-multiple we calculate the true reliability of 
the dictionary, with the initial translation candi-
dates set as recall benchmark. When looking up 
the meanings or translations of a certain head 
word, the user, whether he’s a human or a ma-
chine, expects all translations to be accurate. 
Therefore we evaluated 200 randomly selected 
Japanese entries from the initial translation can-
didates, together with all of their Hungarian 
translations, scoring them as correct (all transla-
tions are correct), acceptable (the good transla-
tions are predominant, but there are up to 2 erro-
neous translations), wrong (the number or wrong 
translations exceeds 2) or missing (the translation 
is missing) (Table 7).  
The same type of mixed, manual evaluation 
was performed by the same author on samples of 
200 entries from each Japanese-Hungarian dic-
tionary. This evaluation was also repeated 10 
times. 
To rank the methods, we only consider the 
correct translations. Our method scored best with 
868
71.45%, outperforming Sjöbergh method’s 
61.65% and Tanaka method’s 46.95% (Table 8).

7 Discussion 
Based on the recall evaluations, the traditional 
methods showed their major weakness by losing 
substantially from the initial recall values, scored 
by the initial translation candidates. Our method 
maintains the same value with the translation 
candidates, but we cannot say that the recall is 
perfect. When compared with a manually created 
dictionary, our method also lost significantly.  
Precision evaluation also showed an im-
provement compared with the traditional meth-
ods, our method outscoring the other two meth-
ods with the 1-to-1 precision evaluation. 1-to-
multiple evaluation was also the highest, proving 
that WordNet based methods outperform dic-
tionary based methods. Discussing the weak-
nesses of our system, we have to divide the prob-
lems into two categories: recall problems deal 
with the difficulty in connecting the target and 
source entries through the pivot language, while 
precision problems discuss the reasons why erro-
neous pairs are produced. 
7.1 Recall problems 
We managed to maximize the recall of our initial 
translation candidates, but in many cases certain 
translation pairs still could not be generated be-
cause the link from the source language to the 
target language through the pivot language sim-
ply doesn’t exist. The main reasons are: the entry 
is missing from at least one of the dictionaries; 
translations in the pivot language are expressions 
or explanations; or there is no direct translation 
or link between the source and target entries. The 
entries that could not be recalled are mostly ex-
pressions, rare entries, words specific to a lan-
guage (ex: tatami: floor-mat, or gulyás: goulash). 
Moreover, a number of head words don’t have 
any synonym, antonym and/or hy-
pernymy/hyponymy information in WordNet, 
and as a result these words could not participate 
in the type B, C, D, E and F scoring. 
7.2 Precision problems 
We identified two types of precision problems. 
The most obvious reasons for erroneous transla-
tions are the polysemous nature of words and the 
meaning-range differences across languages. 
With words whose senses are clear and mostly 
preserved even through the pivot language, most 
of the correct senses were identified and cor-
rectly translated. Nouns, adjectives and adverbs 
had a relatively high degree of accuracy. How-
ever, verbs proved to be the most difficult POS 
to handle. Because semantically they are more 
flexible than other POS categories, and the 
meaning range is also highly flexible across lan-
guages, the identification of the correct transla-
tion is increasingly difficult. For this reason, the 
number of faulty translations and the number of 
meanings that are not translated was relatively 
high. 
One other source of erroneous translations is 
the quality of the initial dictionaries. Even the 
unambiguous type A translations fail to produce 
the desired accuracy, although they are the 
unique candidate for a given word entry. The 
main reason for this is the deficiency of the ini-
tial dictionaries, which contain a great number of 
irrelevant or low usage translations, shadowing 
the main, important senses of some words. In 
other cases the resource dictionaries don’t con-
tain translations of all meanings; homonyms are 
869
present as pivot entries with different meanings, 
sometimes creating unique, but faulty links. 
8 Conclusions 
We proposed a new pivot language based 
method to create bilingual dictionaries that can 
be used as translation resource for machine trans-
lation. In contrast to conventional methods that 
use dictionaries only, our method uses WordNet 
as a main resource of the pivot language to select 
the suitable translation pairs. As a result, we 
eliminate most of the weaknesses caused by the 
structural differences of dictionaries, while prof-
iting from the semantic relations provided by 
WordNet. We believe that because of the nature 
of our method it can be re-implemented with 
most language pairs.  
In addition, owing to features such as the bidi-
rectional selection method with local thresholds 
we managed to maximize recall, while maintain-
ing a precision which is better than any other 
compared method’s score. During exemplifica-
tion, we generated a mid-large sized Japanese-
Hungarian dictionary with relatively good recall 
and promising precision.
