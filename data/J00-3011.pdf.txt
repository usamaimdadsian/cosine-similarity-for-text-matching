Erratum 
In the article Practical Experiments with Regular Approximation of Context-Free Lan- 
guages by Mark-Jan Nederhof that appeared in Computational Linguistics 26(1), the 
equation on page 19 that reads 
3i\[A E Ni A B E Nil - 3O~l,fll, o~2, f12\[A -~* c~lBfll A B --+* o~2Af12\], 
should read 
3i\[A E Ni A B C Ni\] 4# 30~l,fll, Oe2, fl2\[a ---+* O~lBfll A B --+* o~2Af12\], 
instead.
