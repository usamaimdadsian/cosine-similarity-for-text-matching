ABSTRACT 
Kaplan et al (1989) present an approach 
to machine translation based on co-description. 
In this paper we show that the notation is not as 
natural and expressive as it appears. We first 
show that the most natural analysis proposed in 
Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact cover the 
range of data for the important ranslational 
phenomenon in question. This contribution 
extends the work reported on in Sadler et al 
(1989) and Sadler et al (1990). We then go on 
to discuss alternatives which depart from or 
extend the formalism proposed in Kaplan et al 
(1989) in various respects, pointing out some 
directions for further research. The strategies 
discussed have been implemented. 
0. Introduction 
Recent work in LFG uses the notion of 
projection to refer to linguistically relevant map- 
pings or convspondences between levels, 
whether these mappings are direct or involve 
function composition (I-lalvorsen & Kaplan 
(1988), Kaplan (1987), Kaplan et al (1989)). 
Mapping functions uch as V (from c to f struc- 
ture) and o (from c to semantic structure) are 
familiar from the LFO literhture. Kaplan et al 
(1989) extend this approach to Machine Transla- 
tion by defining two translation functions "~ 
(between f-structures) and "~' (between semantic 
structures). By means of these functions, one 
can 'co-describe' lements of source and target 
f-structures and s-structures respectively. 
Achieving translation can be thought of in terms 
of specifying and resolving a set of constraints 
on target structures, constraints which are 
expressed by means of the "~ and "c' functions. 
The formalism permits a wide variety of 
sourco-target correspondences to be expressed: T 
and V can be composed, as can -c' and o. The 
approach allows for equations pecifying trans- 
lations to be added to lexical entries and (source 
language) c-structure rules. For example: 
(1) (~ (? SUB.0) = ((~ 1) SUBJ) 
composes "~ and ap, equating the ~ of the SUBJ 
f-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the "c of 
the mother's f-structure. Thus (1) says that the 
translation of the value of the SUBJ slot in a 
source f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the f- 
structure which is the translation of that source 
f-structure. What results is an interesting, and 
apparently extremely attractive approach to MT, 
which finds echoes in a good deal of recent 
work in MT and Computational Linguistics gen- 
erally (van Noord et al (1990), Zajac (1990)). 
Among the apparent advantages are: 
(i) that it avoids the problems that arise in 
traditional stratificational transfer systems 
where a variety of (often incompatible) 
kinds of information must be expressed in 
a single structure. 
(ii) that, because it uses the formal apparatus 
of LFG, it is at least compatible with a 
large body of well worked out linguistic 
analyses. 
Perhaps most important, however, the 
examples that Kaplan et al give suggest that the 
notation is both natural and expressive: natural, 
in the sense that adequate -c relations can be 
stated on the basis of reasonable intuitive and 
well-motivated linguistic analyses; expressive, in 
the sense that it is powerful enough to describe 
some difficult translation problems in a straight- 
forward way. 
In this paper we show that the notation is 
not as natural and expressive as it at first seems. 
We first show that the most natural analysis pro- 
posed in Kaplan et al (1989) cannot in fact 
cover the range of data for the translational 
phenomenon i question. These eases are impor- 
tant because these constructions represent a per- 
vasive structural difference between languages 
Which one wants to be able to deal with in a 
natural way. We then go on to discuss alterna- 
tives which depart from or extend the formalism 
- 293 - 
proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) in various 
respects, pointing out some directions for further 
research. 
Section 1 
The discussion here concerns the transla- 
tional data of head-switching or splitting/fusing 
discussed in Kaplan et al (1989) as cases of 
differences of embedding: 
(2a) John just arrived. 
Jean vient d'arriver. 
(b) Jan zwemt graag/toevallig. 
John likes to/happens to swim. 
(c) I think that John just arrived. 
Je pense que Jean vient d'arriver. 
(d) Ik denk dat Jan graag zwemt. 
I think that John likes to swim. 
(e) Ich glaube dass Peter gem schwimmt. 
I believe that Peter likes to swim. 
Kaplan et al (1989) sketch two alternative 
approaches to head-switching. The first assumes 
that the adverb is essentially an f-structure head 
subeategorising for a sentential ARG. This has 
the effect of making the source and target f- 
structures rather similar to each other but faces 
a number of serious problems. Firstly, it 
violates the LFG assumption that the f-structure 
of the highest c-structure node contains the f- 
structures of all other nodes. Secondly, while 
such an analysis might well be correct for 
semantic structure, it cannot be justified on 
monolingual grounds as a surface syntactic 
feature structure (an f-structure). For example, 
it is the verb, not the adverb, which is the syn- 
tactic head of the construction, carrying tense 
and participating in agreement phenomena. 
This proposal therefore lacks monolingual 
motivation and thus is not attractive as an 
approach to translation. Thirdly, the approach 
cannot be extended to the case discussed here. 
In this paper we focus on the alternative 
proposal, in which head-switching (or alterna- 
tively, splitting) is a x operation. 1 Adverbs "are 
taken to be f-structure SADJs. The z annotation 
to ADVP states that the x of the mother f- 
structure is the XCOMP of the "~ of the SADJ 
I Notice that a third possibility, not discussed in Ka- 
plan el al (1989), involving a flat f-structure but treating 
the adverb as a semantic head at s-structure, simply 
means  that the mapping problem we describe below ar- 
ises in the monolinsual mapping between f-structure 
and s-structure. 
slot (Kaplan et al's fig. 26): 2 
(3) 
S ~ NP ADVP VP 
(t SUB°3 = ~ (t SADJ)=~ 
(~ (t SADr) XCOMP) = (~ t) 
This has the effect of subordinating the transla- 
tion of the f-structure which contains the SADJ 
to the translation of the SADJ itself. The lexical 
entries themselves contribute further z equations 
(following Kaplan et al's fig. 21): 
(4) 
arrive: V (t PRED) = arrive<SUBJ> 
((x t) PRED FN) = arriver 
(-c (t SUBJ)) = ((~ 1) SUBJ) 
just: ADV 
(~ PRED) = just 
(('~ t) PRED Ft,0 = venir 
john: N 
(~ PILED) = john 
((x t) PRED FN) = jean 
This is unproblernatic for examples such as 
(2a, b). The x equations and further information 
from the target monolingual lexicon collaborate 
to relate (5) to (6): 
(5) 
D arrive,cSUBJ> \] 
(6) 
PRED venir<SUBJ, XCOMP> 
~UBJ  \ [ \ ] - i f '4  
However a problem with the z equations arises 
in translating these sentences in an embedded 
context (2c,d,e). The English structure, and lex-

et al, we ignore the monolingual potential for more than 
one ADVP with its attendant problems for translation.

• (z (t susJ)) = ((-~ t) sum)  
('~ (t COMe))  = ((z t) COMe)  
I: N (I PRED) = I 
((x t) PRED F~ = je 
The equations in (3) and (8) require the transla- 
tion of the f-structure immediately containing 
the SADJ attribute (x (f3)) to be both a COMe 
and an XCOMP in the target f-structure: 
(9) 
((~ fl) PRED FN) = penser 
0; (fl SUBJ)) = (('c fl) SUBJ) 
('~ (fl COMe)) = (('~ fl) COMP) 
((~ f2) PRED FN) = je 
((~ f4) PRED FN) = jean 
(T f3) = (T (13 SAD J) XCOMP) 
(( • f3) PRED FN) = arriver 
(( • r3) sum) = (~ ( t3 sum)) 
((z f5) PRED FI~ = venir 
Notice that since (fl COMe) = f3, and (f3 
SADJ) = fS), we have the following equations 
from the emphasised l ines: 
(~ (f3) = ((~ n) COMe) 
(~ (t'3)) = ((, f5) XCOMe) 
This results in a doubly-rooted DAO (10). 
(lO) 
"PRED venir<SUBJ, XCOMP> 
SUBJ \[ \]+\[4 
XCOMP 
I~7~ppenser <SUBJ, COMP> 
\[..\],, I,,1 
This is clearly not what is required and on stan- 
dard linguistic assumptions, will not be accepted 
by the target generator. It does not give a 
correct ranslation of the source string. 
In this section we have shown that the 
proposal as outlined in Kaplan et al (1989) does 
not produce an adequate analysis of these cases, 
The problem, which is not at first apparent, 
arises from the combination of the regular and 
irregular equations from the emphasised lines. 
Note that there is no problem stating this 
correspondence in the French -> English direc- 
tion (see below). 
Section 2.0. 
In this section we will briefly consider a 
number of alternatives. 3 To facilitate discussion, 
it is worth noting that the proposal in Kaplan et 
al (1989) involves basically three elements: 
(11a) a set of (regular) equations constraining 
both source and target: 
(~ (t SUB~) = ((~ t) sum) 
( l lb) a set of (regular) equations assigning tar- 
get PRED values: 
((~ t) PRED ~9 = sere form 
( l lc )  a (special) equation on ADVP constrain- 
ing both source and target: 
((~ (I' SADJ)) XCOMP) = (~ t)  
The problem noted above arises from the 
combination of an equation from (a) with 
the equation (c). 
Section 2.1. 
The first alternative we considered 
involves maintaining equations of type (a) (so 
that (T (f3) is indeed (('~ fl) COMe)), and then 
switching heads only (rather than whole con- 
structions). The basic idea is that the ~ annota- 
tions to ADVP provide a PRED value for xD 
and specify that the • of the PRED of t3 is the 
PRED in (~-f3 XCOMP). To do this, the PRED 
value must be made into a complex feature, and 
+heavy use is made of "~ equations on the c- 
structure rules, so that the mapping is essentially 
structurally determined. 
3 These alternat/ves have been ex#ored by usin 8 at 
Essex an implementation of PArR due to Bob Car- 
penter, and at Edinburgh a ve~on of MicroPATR. 
- 295 -' 
Intuitively, the approach works by build- 
ing target constructions without assigning them 
PRED values directly, then specifying the target 
PRED values in such a way that it is possible to 
switch the heads for the eases in question..LP 
In fact, though this works for cases such as 
(2c,d,e), it is limited to cases in which it is 
correct o raise all the dependents of a predicate 
to the same slot in the construction headed by 
the translation of the adverb. It thus fails with 
(12a) in which races must remain a dependent 
of the embedded construction, and (12b) in 
which the same is true of Jean: 
(12a) Peter zwemt gruag wedstrijden. 
Peter likes to swim races. 
(12b) I said that John will probably come. 
J'ai dit qu'il est probable que Jean viendra. 
This is of course an immediate consequence of
the fact that the proposal works by switching 
not constructions but heads..SH Section 2.2. 
It is clear from the above that any solu- 
tion must achieve constructional integrity in 
translation. This idea can be achieved in a 
number of (slightly different) ways. In the fol- 
lowing we exploit the path equation variables 
available in LFG, which permit one to use a 
value assigned elsewhere as an attribute (that is, 
our proposal here is modelled on the use of (1' 
(~ PCASE) = ~) in LFG. 
We alter ( l la) and (l lb) so that the paths 
that they constrain are sensitive to the value of 
an attribute (which we call CTYPE): 
(13) 
(( "c 1 )` (1  `CTYPE) PRED FN) = sem form 
(( "c 1') (1` CTYPE) SUBJ) =.0; (1` SUEd)) 
(( x 1`) (1` CTYPE) OBJ) = (~ (1  `OBJ)) a 
The value of Cq"YPE is given by the adverbial 
annotations: 
(14a) 
on ADVP: 
(~t)=(TD 
(1  `CTYPE) = (~ TYPE) 
4 Notice that edl dependents of a head must be mado 
sensitive to the value of the CTYPE attribute (to main- 
lain constructional integrity). To deal with non- 
subeategorised constituents such as SADJs (whose x 
equations are given by c-structure rule) we must anno- 
late ADVP with: "¢ ( t  SADJ) = (( x t)  (? CTYPE) 
SAm) 
(14b) 
on the adverb just: 
(1  `TYPE = XCOMP) 
Notice that the "c annotation to ADVP (which 
states that the translation of the containing f- 
structure is the translation of the f-structure 
associated with the ADVP (i.e: the SADJ slot)) 
simply equates the x of two f-structures and 
avoids the problem which beset the proposal in 
Kaplan et al (1989). This can be seen from the 
equation set for (2c) in (15). Note that when 
there is no adverb, the value of ( t CTYPE) 
must be ¢ (since paths are regular expressions 
((~ ?) ( 0 GD - ((T t) G~3). 
(15) 
((~ fl) PRED FN) --- penser 
(~ (n sum)) = ((~ fl) sum)  
(z (fl COMP)) = ((~: fl) COMP) 
((, f2) PRED FN) = je 
(( z f3) XCOMP PRED FN) = arriver 
(( ~ f3) XCOMP SUm-) = (~ ( f3 SUm)) 
(('c f4) PRED FN) = jean 
(~ t3) = (~ f5) 
((x f5) PRED FN) = venir 
What is the cost of this proposal? The 
translational correspondences: in all lexical 
entries will be sensitive in this way to the value 
of the CTYPE feature. We must guarantee that 
when a value is not contributed by the type 
feature on the adverb, the value of ( 1' CTYPE) 
is e, either by some priority union operation to 
initialise it to e, or by some other convention 
with this effect, or by assuming different ver- 
sions of the c-structure rules (with VP contribut- 
ing ( 1`  CTYPE) = E) as appropriate. 
Variants of this solution which do not 
exploit the path equation variable apparatus of 
LFG are also possible, though at the cost of 
massively increasing the size of the lexicon. 
For example, lexieal translation correspondences 
could be disjunctions as in (16).

- 296 - 
It remains to be seen whether one needs the 
constraining condition to rule out unwanted 
'partial' or 'extra' translations; or whether one 
can rely on completeness and coherence checks 
on the target side. 
Section 2.3. 
Our third alternative involves giving the 
path equations ome sort of functional uncer- 
tainty interpretation. Our starting point is the 
problematic pair of equations repeated in (17) 
and the observation that the required target 
structure embeds the XCOMP within the 
COMP. 
(17) 
(x (~ COMP)) = ((x I )COMP)- 
(-~ (~)) = ((~ a)  CoMe) 
(x 1') = (x (~ SAD J) XCOMP) - 
(x (f3)) = ((-t fS) XCOMP) 
The interpretation f the (r (t COMP)) = (('c t) 
COMP) could be loosened on the source side, as 
in (18): 
(18) 
(-c (t COMa OF)) = ((~ t ) COMe).  
(x (r3 oF)) -- ((x n)  ¢OMP) 
which specifies that the translation of some f- 
structure on a path from the source COMP (e.g. 
the COMP SADJ) fills the COMP slot in the 
translation. This avoids the problem in (17). 
Equally, the interpretation could be loosened on 
the target side: 
(19) 
(x (t COMP)) = (('t ~) COMP OF) ,, 
(,t(f3)) : ((-c n) COMP OF)" 
which says that the translation of the COMP 
fills some path from the COMP slot in the trans- 
lation (e.g. the COMP XCOMP). This proposal 
raises a number of interesting questions for 
further esearch about whether functional uncer- 
tainty can be used here while still guaranteeing 
some determinate set of output structures to be 
validated (or not) by the target grammar. 
Notice however that for the case in hand, the 
uncertainty equation can be quite specific - all 
that is required is the source functional uncer- 
tainty: 
('~ (f COMP SAD J)) = (('t t ) COMP) 
3. Conclusion. 
Our starting point in this paper was the 
observation that a treatment proposed for cases 
such as (2) in Kaplan et al (1989) is unwork- 
able. We have then discussed alternative 
approaches available within the general model 
assumed by Kaplan et al (1989). We have 
shown that the problem is to achieve simple 
general statements of the correspondence map- 
ping which cover exceptional eases without 
spreading the effect of exceptionality hroughout 
the grammar. The discussion in section 2 raises 
intricate technical issues about the formalism 
itself, but also relates to wider issues concerning 
the modularity of the approach to translation 
proposed in Kaplan et al (1989) as well as the 
suitability and expressivity of the formalism, 
raising serious questions about the feasibility of 
a large MT system along these lines. 
We also noted that these eases are 
unproblematic in the "fusing" direction, for then 
we do not run into problems with the func- 
tionality of the x correspondence. In this direc- 
tion, the 'special' equations are within the lexi- 
eal entry for venir: 
20) 
(( • T) SADJ PRED FN) = just 
(~ t )  = (~ (t  XCOMP)) 
Substituting variables for clarity, combining 
fhese equations with the regular equation from 
the embedding verb (penser) produces no incon- 
sistency, since the path specifications -all COMP 
and xf5 can be equated: 
(21) 
(~ (n COMP) = ((~ a)  COMe) = 
(-c 13) = (('~ fl) COMP) 
(~ 13) = (~ (13 XCOMP)) - 
(~ 13) = O: (fs)) 
(( "~ 13) SADJ PRED FN) = just 
This observation raises interesting questions 
concerning the directionality assumed in Kaplan 
et al (1989). R seems that the correct way to 
view all this is that we have a system of 
correspondences relating 4 structures (Source 
and Target c and f structures). For a given set 
of correspondences and a partially determined 
Set of structures, three possibilities exist: 
• no solution can be found; 
- 297 - 
• a finite number of solutions can be found; 
• an indeterminate and/or infinite number of 
solutions can be found. 
We might expect herefore that a solution 
may be found even if we state correspondences 
in the French -> English direction but supply 
the partial determination from the English side 
(that is, when English is source). The system for 
translating in either direction would then be a 
pair of monolingual grammars with a set of x 
equations tated in the "fusing" direction (i.e. in 
the French grammar). This is currently under 
investigation. 
Preliminary results suggest that this 
approach will in fact cleanly overcome the 
specific problem at hand. It has proved possible 
to translate sentences (2b) and (2d) above from 
Dutch to English using grammars and lexicons 
in which ~ only appears in the English rules and 
entries. But this work has in turned raised a 
number of fundamental issues, some of which 
apply not only to LFG but to any other attempt 
at theory-based translation: 
• Exactly what does the formal definition of 
the 'translates' relation look like, in LFG 
or any other theory-based approach to 
translation? 
• Can this formal definition actually be 
implemented? Existing approaches to 
generation from f/s-structure in LFG are 
too restrictive (Wedekind 1988), and our 
current implementation ver-compensates. 
• Is the functional nature of correspon- 
dences appropriate to the z family, or 
would a relation be more appropriate? If 
so, what would the theoretical and practi- 
cal consequences be? 
• What is the relation between strict 
theory-based 'translation' and translation 
in the ordinary sense of the word? Is it 
not likely that its applicability will in 
practice be limited to closely related 
language pairs? 
• Is there a substantive difference between 
the structures and - correspondences 
approach of LFG and the single - struc- 
tured - sign approach of I-IPSG or UCG? 
Translation seems a strenuous test.
