Abstract
This paper reports the latest performance of com-
ponents and features of a project named Corpus-
Centered Computation (C'3), which targets a trans-
lation technology suitable for spoken language
translation. C3 places corpora at the center of the
technology. Translation knowledge is extracted
from corpora by both EBMT and SMT methods,
translation quality is gauged by referring to cor-
pora, the best translation among multiple-engine
outputs is selected based on corpora and the cor-
pora themselves are paraphrased or filtered by
automated processes.
1 Introduction
Our project, named Corpus-Centered Computation
(( 3), proposes solutions for efficiently constructing
a high-quality translation subsystem for a speech-
to-speech translation system.
This paper introduces recent progress in C3 . Sec-
tions 2 and 3 demonstrate a competition between
multiple machine translation systems developed in
our project, and Sections 4 and 5 explain the fea-
tures that differentiate our project from other cor-
pus-based projects.
2 Three Corpus-based MT Systems
There are two main strategies in corpus-based ma-
chine translation: (i) Example-Based Machine
Translation (EBMT; Nagao, 1984; Somers, 1999)
and (ii) Statistical Machine Translation (SMT;
Brown et al., 1993; Knight, 1997; Ney, 2001; Al-
shawi et al., 2000). C3 is developing both tech-
nologies in parallel and blending them. In this
paper, we introduce three different machine trans-
lation systems: Di, HPAT, and SAT.
The three MT systems are characterized by dif-
ferent translation units. D3, HPAT, and SAT use
sentences, phrases, and words, respectively.
D3 (Sentence-based EBMT): It retrieves the most
similar example by DP-matching of the input and
example sentences and adjusts the gap between the
input and the retrieved example by using dictionar-
ies. (Sumita 2001)
HPAT (Phrase-based EBMT): Based on phrase-
aligned bilingual trees, transfer patterns are gener-
ated. According to the patterns, the source phrase
structure is obtained and converted to generate tar-
get sentences (Imamura 2002)
SAT (Word-based SMT): Watanabe et al.
(2002b) implemented SAT dealing with Japanese
and English on top of a word-based SMT frame-
work (Brown et al. 1993).
3 Competition on the Same Corpus
3.1 Resources
In our competitive evaluation of the MT systems,
we used the BTEC corpus ', which is a collection
of Japanese sentences and their English transla-
tions typically found in phrasebooks for tourists.
The size is about 150 thousand sentence pairs. A
quality evaluation was done using a test set
consisting of 345 sentences selected randomly
from the above corpus, and the remaining
sentences were used for learning and verification.
For each source sentence in the test set, 16
reference translations were prepared by 5 bilingual
translators.
1 BTEC was called BE in the paper (Takezawa et al.,
2002).
171
We used bilingual dictionaries and thesauri of
about fifty thousand words for the travel domain.
3.2 Evaluation Measures
We used the measures below. The BLEU score
and the RED rank are measured by referring to the
test corpus, i.e., a set of input sentences and their
multiple reference translations; the HUMAN rank
and the estimated TOEIC score are judged by bi-
lingual translators.
(1) Average of Ranks2 :
HUMAN rank: In our evaluation, 9 translators
who are native speakers of the target language
ranked the MT translations into 4 ranks: A, B, C,
and D, from good to bad (Sumita et al., 1999). 3
RED rank: An automatic ranker is learned as a
decision tree from HUMAN-ranked examples. It
exploits edit-distances between MT and multiple
reference translations (Akiba et al., 2001).
(2) BLEU score: The MT translations are scored
based on the precision of N-grams in an entire set
of multiple reference translations (Papineni et al.,
2002). It ranges from 1.0 (best) down to 0.0
(worst).
(3) Estimated TOEIC score: It is important to
interpret MT performance from the viewpoint of a
language proficiency test such as TOEIC 4 . A trans-
lator compared MT translations with human ones,
then, MT's proficiency is estimated by regression
analysis (Sugaya et al., 2000). It ranges from 10
(lowest) to 990 points (perfect).
3.3 Results
Table 1 wraps up the results. So far, SMT has been
applied mainly to language pairs of similar Euro-
pean languages. Skeptical opinions dominate about
2 Average is calculated: A, B, C, and D are assigned
values of 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, and their sum is
divided by the sentence count (345 in the experiment).
3 The final rank for each translation is the median of the
nine ranks given by independent evaluators.

International Communication', which is an English
language proficiency test for people whose native
language is not English (http://www.chauncey.com/).
the effectiveness or applicability of SMT to dis-
similar language pairs. However, we implemented
SMT for translation between Japanese and English.
They are dissimilar in many points, such as word
order and lexical systems. We found that SAT,
which is an SMT, worked in both J-to-E and E-
to-J directions.
The EBMT systems, HPAT and D3, surpassed
SAT in the HUMAN rank. This is the reverse re-
sult obtained in a Verbmobil experiment (Ney,
2001) where an SMT system scored highest. We
are studying these interesting contradictory
observations.
Let's consider the relationships among the
HUMAN rank, the RED rank, and the BLEU score.
While RED accords with HUMAN, BLEU fails
to agree with HUMAN in the EJ evaluation.
One reason for this is that the BLEU score favors
SAT translations in that they are more similar to the
reference translation from the viewpoint of N-
grams.

Let's move on to the estimated TOEIC score of
the most accurate JE system in the experiment. D3
achieved a high score of 870. This is more than
one hundred points higher than the average score
of a Japanese businessperson in an overseas de-
partment of a company.
4 Corpus-based Selector
This section introduces a feature of C3 : selection of
the best from outputs produced by multiple transla-
tion engines.
No single system can achieve complete transla-
tion of every input. The quality rank of a given
input sentence changes system by system. We
show a sample of different English translations
5 HPAT for JE and D3 for EJ also work well, but we
omitted them from the table because we could not
afford the time and cost of the human evaluation for
them.

obtained by the three systems for the Japanese sen-
tence, 'o-shiharai wa genkin desu ka kurejitto
kaado desu ka' (Table 2). The brackets show the
HUMAN rank, as described above.
Table 2. Sample of Translation Variety
[B] Is the payment cash? Or is it the credit card?
[A] Would you like to pay in cash or with a credit card?
[C] Could you cash or credit card?
In our experiment, while D3 , HPAT, and SAT for
the E-to-J direction have A-ratios of 0.62, 0.55,
and 0.53, respectively, the ideal selection would
have an interestingly high A-ratio of 0.79. Thus,
we could obtain a large increase in accuracy if it
were possible to select the best one of the three
different translations for each input sentence.
Unlike other approaches such as (Brown and
Frederking, 1995), we do not merge multiple re-
sults into a single one but we select the best one
because the large difference between multiple
translations for distant language pairs such as Japa-
nese and English makes merging infeasible.
Methods using N-gram statistics of a target lan-
guage corpus have been proposed before (Brown
and Frederking, 1995; Callison-Burch et al., 2001).
They are based on the assumptions that (1) the
naturalness of the translations is effective for se-
lecting good translations because they are sensitive
to the broken target sentences due to errors in
translation processes, and (2) the source and target
correspondences from the semantic point of view
are maintained in a state-of-the-art translation sys-
tem. However, the second assumption does not
necessarily hold. To solve this problem, Akiba et al.
(2002) used not only a language model but also a
translation model of SMT derived from a corpus,
and Sumita et al. (2002) exploited a corpus whose
sentences are converted into semantic class se-
quences. These two selectors outperformed con-
ventional selectors using the target N-gram in our
experiments.
5 Paraphrasing and Filtering
This section introduces another feature of C3 :
paraphrasing and filtering corpora.
The large variety of possible translations in a
corpus causes difficulty in building machine trans-
lation on the corpus. For example, the variety
makes it harder to estimate the parameters for SAT,
to find appropriate translation examples for D3 , to
extract good transfer patterns for HPAT. We pro-
pose ways to overcome these problems by para-
phrasing corpora through automated processes or
filtering corpora by abandoning inappropriate ex-
pressions.
Two methods have been investigated for auto-
matic paraphrasing. (1) Shimohata et al. (2002a)
group sentences by the equivalence of the transla-
tion and extract rules of paraphrasing by DP-
matching. (2) Finch et al. (2002) cluster sentences
in a handcrafted paraphrase corpus (Sugaya et al.,
2002) to obtain pairs that are similar to each other
for training SMT models, then by using the models
the decoder generates a paraphrase. The experi-
mental results indicate that (i) the EBMT based on
normalization had increased coverage (Shimohata
et al., 2002b) and (ii) the SMT created on the nor-
malized sentences had a reduced word-error-rate
(Watanabe et al., 2002a).
Imamura et al. (2003) proposed a calculation
that measures the literalness of a translation pair
and called it TCR. After the word alignment of a
translation pair, TCR is calculated as the rate of the
aligned word count over the count of words in the
translation pair. After abandoning the non-literal
parts of the corpus, the acquisition of HPAT trans-
fer patterns is done. The effect has been confirmed
by an improvement in translation quality.
6 Conclusion
Our project, called C3 , places corpora at the center
of speech-to-speech technology. Good perform-
ance in translation components is demonstrated in
the experiment. In addition, the corpus-based proc-
esses of translation, evaluation, and paraphrasing
have synergistic effects. Therefore, we are optimis-
tic about the further progress of components and
their integration.
