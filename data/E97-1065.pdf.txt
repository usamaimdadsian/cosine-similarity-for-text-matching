The information used for the extraction of 
terms can be considered as rather 'inter- 
nal', i.e. coming from the candidate string 
itself. This paper presents the incorpora- 
tion of 'external' information derived from 
the context of the candidate string. It 
is embedded to the C-value approach for 
automatic term recognition (ATR), in the 
form of weights constructed from statisti- 
cal characteristics of the context words of 
the candidate string. 
1 In t roduct ion  &: Re la ted  Work  
The applications of term recognition (specialised ic- 
tionary construction and maintenance, human and 
machine translation, text categorization, etc.), and 
the fact that new terms appear with high speed in 
some domains (e.g. in computer science), enforce the 
need for automating the extraction of terms. ATR 
also gives the potential to work with large amounts 
of real data, that it would not be able to handle man- 
ually. We should note that by ATR we neither mean 
dictionary string matching, nor term interpretation 
(which deals with the relations between terms and 
concepts). 
Terms may consist of either one or more words. 
When the aim is the extraction of single-word terms, 
domain-dependent linguistic information (i.e. mor- 
phology) is used (Ananiadou, 1994). Multi-word 
ATR usually uses linguistic information in the form 
of a grammar that mainly allows noun phrases or 
compounds to be extracted as candidate terms: 
(Bourigault, 1992) extracts maximal-length noun 
phrases and their subgroups (depending on their 
grammatical structure and position) as candidate 
terms. (Dagan and Church, 1994), accept sequen- 
cies of nouns, which give them high precision, but 
not such a good recall as that of (Justeson and 
Katz, 1995), which allow some prepositions (i.e. oj~ 
to be part of the extracted candidate terms. (Frantzi 
and Ananiadou, 1996), stand between these two ap- 
proaches, allowing the extracted compounds to con- 
tain adjectives but no prepositions. (Daille et al., 
1994) also allow adjectives to be part of the two- 
word English terms they extract. 
From the above, only (Bourigault, 1992) does not 
use any statistical information. (Justeson and Katz, 
1995) and (Dagan and Church, 1994) use the fre- 
quency of occurrence of the candidate string as a 
measure of its likelihood to be a term. (Daille et al., 
1994) agree that frequency of occurrence "presents 
the best histogram", but also suggest the likeli- 
hood ratio for the extraction of two-word English 
terms. (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 1996), besides the 
frequency of occurrence, also consider the frequency 
of the candidate string as a part of longer candidate 
terms, as well as the number of these longer candi- 
date terms it is found nested in. 
In this paper, we extend C-value, the statisti- 
cal measure proposed by (Frantzi and Ananiadou, 
1996), incorporating information gained from the 
textual context of the candidate term. 
2 Context  informat ion fo r  te rms 
The idea of incorporating context information for 
term extraction came from that "Extended term 
units are different in type from extended word units 
in that they cannot be freely modified" (Sager, 
1978). Therefore, information from the modifiers 
of the candidate strings could be used in the pro- 
cedure of their evaluation as candidate terms. This 
could be extended beyond adjective/noun modifica- 
tion, to verbs that belong to the candidate string's 
context. For example, the form shows of the verb to 
show in medical domains, is very often followed by 
a term, e.g. shows a basal cell carcinoma. There are 
cases where the verbs that appear with terms can 
even be domain independent, like the form called of 
501 
the verb to call, or the form known of the verb to 
know, which are often involved in definitions in var- 
ious areas, e.g. is known as the singular existential 
quantifier, is called the Cartesian product. 
Since context carries information about terms it 
should be involved in the procedure for their ex- 
traction. We incorporate context information in the 
form of weights constructed in a fully automatic way. 
2.1 The  L inguist ic  Par t  
The corpus is tagged, and a linguistic filter will only 
accept specific part-of-speech sequencies. The choice 
of the linguistic filter affects the precision and re- 
call of the results: having a 'closed' filter, that is, 
a strict one regarding the part-of-speech sequencies 
it accepts, like the N + that (Dagan and Church, 
1994) use, wilt improve the precision but have bad 
effect on the recall. On the other side, an 'open' 
filter, one that accepts more part-of-speech sequen- 
cies, like that of (Justeson and Katz, 1995) that ac- 
cepts prepositions as well as adjectives and nouns, 
will have the opposite result. 
In our choice of the linguistic filter, we lie some- 
where in the middle, accepting strings consisting of 
adjectives and nouns: 
( N ounlAdjective) + Noun (1) 
However, we do not claim that this specific fil- 
ter should be used at all cases, but that its choice 
depends on the application: the construction of 
domain-specific dictionaries requires high coverage, 
and would therefore allow low precision in order to 
achieve high recall, while when speed is required, 
high quality would be better appreciated, so that 
the manual filtering of the extracted list of candidate 
terms can be as fast as possible. So, in the first case 
we could choose an 'open' linguistic filter (e.g. one 
that accepts prepositions), while in the second, a 
'closed' one (e.g. one that only accepts nouns). 
The type of context involved on the extraction 
of candidate terms is also an issue. At this stage 
of this work, the adjectives, nouns and verbs are 
considered. However, further investigation is needed 
over the context used (as it is discussed in the future 
work). 
2.2 The  Stat is t ica l  Par t  
The procedure involves the following steps: 
Step 1: The raw corpus is tagged and from 
the tagged corpus the strings that obey the 
(NounlAdjective)+Noun expression are extracted. 
Step 2: For these strings, C-value is calculated 
resulting in a list of candidate terms (ranked by C- 
value as their likelihood of being terms). The length 
of the string is incorporated in the C-value measure 
resulting to C-value' 
C-value' (a) -=- I 
where 
log2 lalf(a) lal = max, ~,~, ~(b) 
log2 lal(f(a) - p(ro) ) 
otherwise 
(2) 
a is the examined string, 
lal the length of a in terms of number of words, 
f(a) the frequency of a in the corpus, 
Ta the set of candidate terms that contain a, 
P(T~) the number of these candidate terms. 
At this point the incorporation of the context in- 
formation will take place. 
Step 3: Since C-value is a measure for extract- 
ing terms, the top of the previously constructed list 
presents the higher density on terms among any 
other part of the list. This top of the list, or else, 
the 'first' of these ranked candidate terms will give 
the weights to the context. We take the top ranked 
candidate strings, and from the initial corpus we ex- 
tract their context which currently are the adjec- 
tives, nouns and verbs that surround the candidate 
term. For each of these adjectives, nouns and verbs, 
we consider three parameters: 
1. its total frequency in the corpus, 
2. its frequency as a context word (of the 'first' 
candidate terms), 
3. the number of these 'first' candidate terms it 
appears with. 
These characteristics are combined in the following 
way to assign a weight to the context word 
ft(w) ) Weight(w) = 0.5(~ -~ + f(w) (3) 
where 
w is the noun/verb/adjective to be assigned a 
weight, 
n the number of the 'first' candidate terms consid- 
ered, 
t(w) the number of candidate terms the word w ap- 
pears with, 
ft(w) w's total frequency appearing with candidate 
terms, 
f(w) w's total frequency in the corpus. 
A variation to improve the results, that involves 
human interaction, is the following: the candidate 
terms involved for the extraction of context are 
firstly manually evaluated, and only the 'real terms' 
will proceed to the extraction of the context and as- 
signment of weights (as previously). 
502 
At this point a list of context words together with 
their weights has been created. 
Step 4: The previously created by C-value r list will 
now be re-ordered considering the weights obtained 
from step 3. For each of the candidate strings of the 
list. its context (adjectives, nouns and verbs that 
surround it) are extracted from the corpus. These 
context words have either been found at step 3 and 
therefore assigned a weight, or not. In the latter 
case, they are now assigned weight equal to 0. 
Each of these candidate strings is now ready to be 
assigned a context weight which would be the sum 
of the weights of its context words: 
wei(a) = Weight(b) + 1 (4) 
b~C° 
where 
a is the examined n-gram, 
Ca the context of a, 
Weight(b) the calculated (from step 3) weight for 
the word b. 
The candidate terms will be now re-ranked according 
to: 
1 NC.value(a) = ~ C-value'(a) • wei(a) (5) tog(. r) 
where 
a is the examined n-gram, 
C-value'(a) calculated from step 2, 
wei(a), the calculated from step 4 sum of the context 
weights for a, 
N the size of the corpus in terms of number of words. 
3 Future  work  
Our future work involves 
1. The investigation of the context used for the 
evaluation of the candidate string, and the amount 
of information that various context carries. We said 
that for this prototype we considered the adjectives, 
nouns and verbs that surround the candidate string. 
However, could ~something else' also carry useful in- 
formation? Should adjectives, nouns and verbs all 
be considered to carry the same amount of informa- 
tion, or should they be assigned ifferent weights? 
2. The investigation of the assignment of weights 
on the parameters used for the measures. Currently, 
the measures contain the parameters in a 'flat' way. 
That is, not really considering the 'weight' (the im- 
portance) of each of them. So, the measures are at 
this point a description of which parameters to be 
used, and not on the degree to which they should be 
used. 
3. The comparison of this method with other ATR 
approaches. The experimentation real data will 
show if this approach actually brings improvement to
the results in comparison with previous approaches. 
Moreover, the application on real data should cover 
more than one domains.
