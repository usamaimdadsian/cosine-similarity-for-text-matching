Abstract
Creating a language-independent meaning
representation would benefit many cross-
lingual NLP tasks. We introduce the first un-
supervised approach to this problem, learn-
ing clusters of semantically equivalent English
and French relations between referring expres-
sions, based on their named-entity arguments
in large monolingual corpora. The clusters
can be used as language-independent semantic
relations, by mapping clustered expressions
in different languages onto the same relation.
Our approach needs no parallel text for train-
ing, but outperforms a baseline that uses ma-
chine translation on a cross-lingual question
answering task. We also show how to use the
semantics to improve the accuracy of machine
translation, by using it in a simple reranker.
1 Introduction
Identifying a language-independent semantics is a
major long term goal of computational linguistics,
and is interesting both theoretically and for practical
applications. It assumes that semantically equiva-
lent sentences in any language can be mapped onto
a common meaning representation. Such a repre-
sentation would be of great utility for tasks such
as translation, relation extraction, summarization,
question answering, and information retrieval. Re-
gardless of whether it is even possible to create such
a semantics, we show that an incomplete version can
be useful for downstream tasks.
Semantic machine translation aims to map a
source language to a language-independent meaning
representation, and then generate the target language
translation from this. It is hoped this would allevi-
ate the difficulties of simpler models when translat-
ing between languages with very different word or-
dering and syntax (Vauquois, 1968). Despite many
attempts to define interlingual representations (Mi-
tamura et al., 1991; Beale et al., 1995; Banarescu et
al., 2013), state-of-the-art machine translation still
uses phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2007). The
major obstacle to defining interlinguas has been de-
vising a meaning representation that is language-
independent, but capable of expressing the limitless
number of meanings that natural languages can ex-
press (Dorr et al., 2004).
Our approach avoids this problem by utilizing the
methods of distributional semantics. Recent work
has shown that paraphrases of expressions can be
learned by clustering those with similar arguments
(Poon and Domingos, 2009; Yao et al., 2011; Lewis
and Steedman, 2013)—for example learning that X
wrote Y and X is the author of Y are equivalent if
they appear in a corpus with similar (X, Y) argument-
pairs such as {(Shakespeare, Macbeth), (Dickens,
Oliver Twist)}. We extend this to the multilingual
case, aiming to also map the French equivalents X
a e´crit Y and Y est un roman de X on to the same
cluster as the English paraphrases. Conceptually,
we treat a foreign expression as a paraphrase of an
English expression. The cluster identifier can be
used as a predicate in a logical form, suggesting that
the fundamental predicates of an interlingua can be
learnt in an unsupervised manner via clustering.
In this paper we focus on learning binary relations
between named entities. This problem is much sim-
pler than attempting complete interlingual semantic
681
interpretation, but the approach could be general-
ized. This class of expressions has proved extremely
useful in the monolingual case, with direct applica-
tions for question answering and relation extraction
(Poon and Domingos, 2009; Mintz et al., 2009), and
we demonstrate how to use them to improve ma-
chine translation. It is important to be able to ex-
tract knowledge across languages, as many facts will
not be expressed in all languages—either due to less-
complete encyclopedias being available in some lan-
guages, or facts being most relevant to a single coun-
try.
In contrast to most previous work on machine
translation and cross-lingual clustering, our method
requires no parallel text (see Section 8 for discussion
of some exceptions). It instead exploits an alignment
between named-entities in different languages. The
limited size of parallel corpora is a significant bot-
tleneck for machine translation (Resnik and Smith,
2003), whereas our approach can be used on much
larger monolingual corpora. This means it is poten-
tially useful for language-pairs where little parallel
text is available, for domain adaptation, or for semi-
supervised approaches.
2 Basic Approach
Our work builds on clustering-based approaches to
monolingual distributional semantics, aiming to cre-
ate clusters of semantically equivalent predicates,
based on their arguments in a corpus. In each lan-
guage, we first map each sentence in a large mono-
lingual corpus onto a simple logical form, by ex-
tracting binary predicates between named entities.
Then, we cluster predicates both within and between
languages into those with similar arguments.
When parsing a new sentence, instead of using
the monolingual predicate, we use the cluster identi-
fier as a language-independent semantic relation, as
shown in Figure 1. The resulting logical form can be
used for inference in question answering.
Unlike traditional approaches to translation, this
does not require parallel text—but it does impose
some additional constraints on language resources.
Our approach requires:
• A large amount of factual text, as we rely on
the same facts being expressed in different lan-
guages. We use Wikipedia, which contains ar-
ticles in 250 languages, including 121 with at
least 10,000 articles.1 Other domains, such as
Newswire, may also be effective.
• A method for extracting binary relations from
sentences. This is straightforward from depen-
dency parses, which are available for many lan-
guages. It is also possible without a parser,
with some language-specific work (Fader et al.,
2011). We describe our approach in Section 3.
• A method for linking entities in the training
data to some canonical representation. Mc-
Namee et al. (2011) report good results on this
task in 21 languages. We describe our method
for this in Section 4.1.
3 Predicate Extraction
Our method relies on extracting binary predicates
between entities from sentences. Various represen-
tations have been suggested for binary predicates,
such as Reverb patterns (Fader et al., 2011), de-
pendency paths (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Yao et al.,
2011), and binarized predicate-argument relations
derived from a CCG-parse (Lewis and Steedman,
2013). Our approach is formalism-independent, and
is compatible with any method of expressing binary
predicates.
We choose the CCG-based parser of Lewis and
Steedman (2013) for several reasons. It out-
puts a logical form derived automatically from
the CCG-parse, containing predicates such as:
writearg0,arg1(shakespeare,macbeth). By using the
close relationship between the CCG syntax and se-
mantics, it is able to generalize over many seman-
tically equivalent syntactic constructions (such as
passives, conjunctions and relative clauses), mean-
ing we can map both Shakespeare wrote Macbeth
and Macbeth was written by Shakespeare to the
same logical form. Using a dependency-based rep-
resentation, these would have different predicates,
which would need to be clustered later. CCG also
has a well developed theory of operator semantics
(Steedman, 2012), so is able to represent semantic
operators such as quantifiers, negation and tense—
understanding these is crucial to high performance
on question answering or translation tasks. As in

Lewis and Steedman (2013), clusters derived from
the output from the parser can be integrated into the
lexicon, allowing us to build logical forms which
capture both operator and lexical semantics.
Accurate CCG syntactic parsers are currently
only available for English, whereas dependency
treebanks and parsers exist for many languages
(Buchholz and Marsi, 2006). Consequently, for
French we use the dependency path representation,
which captures the nodes and edges connecting two
named entities in a dependency parse. The extrac-
tion of these paths is language-independent, and
does not depend on the dependency grammar used,
which means our approach could be adapted to new
languages with minimal work.
4 Entity Semantics
4.1 Entity Linking
As discussed, our approach assumes that semanti-
cally similar predicates will have similar argument
entities. This requires us to be able to identify core-
ferring entities across languages during training. In
the monolingual case, it suffices to represent entities
by the string used in the sentence. This is inadequate
in the multilingual case, as many entities may be re-
ferred to by different names in different languages—
for example the United States translates as les E´tats-
Unis in French and die Vereinigte Staaten in Ger-
man. This problem is worsened by the ambiguity of
named-entity strings—for example, in the context of
a sports article, United States may refer specifically
to a team, rather than a country.
Recent work on multilingual named-entity link-
ing (McNamee et al., 2011) shows how to link
named entities in multiple languages onto English
Wikipedia articles, which can be used as unique
identifiers for entities. This means that we could
gain the information we need from unrestricted
text. However, as we use Wikipedia itself for
our training corpora, we can bootstrap entity infor-
mation directly from its markup. Wikipedia con-
tains cross-language links, e.g. between the United
States articles in different languages, allowing us
to determine the equivalence of entities in differ-
683
ent languages. Wikipedia links also help us au-
tomatically disambiguate entities to a given arti-
cle. For unlinked named-entity mentions, we per-
form some simple heuristic co-reference—based on
word-overlap with previously mentioned entities in
the document, whether the mention name is the ti-
tle of a Wikipedia article, or whether the mention
name is a Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) alias of
an entity. We emphasise that this does not mean our
approach is only applicable to the Wikipedia corpus.
4.2 Entity Typing
It has become standard in clustering approaches to
distributional semantics to assign types to predicates
before clustering, and only cluster predicates with
the same type (Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Berant
et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2012). This is useful for
resolving ambiguity—for example the phrase born
in may express a place-of-birth or date-of-birth rela-
tion depending on whether its second argument has
a LOC or DAT type. Ambiguous expressions may
translate differently in other languages—for exam-
ple, the two interpretations of was born in translate
in French as est ne´ a` and est ne´ en respectively. The
type of a predicate is determined by the type of its
arguments, and predicates with different types are
treated as distinct.
Lewis and Steedman (2013) induce an unsuper-
vised model of entity types using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (Blei et al., 2003), based on selectional
preferences of verbs and argument-taking nouns.
When applied cross-linguistically, we found this
technique tended to create language-specific topics.
Instead, we exploit the fact that many Wikipedia en-
tities are linked to the Freebase database, which has
a detailed manually-built type-schema. This means
for a Wikipedia entity, we can look up its set of types
in Freebase.2 We use the simplified type-set of 112
types created by Ling and Weld (2012). Where en-
tities have multiple types (for example, Shakespeare
is both an author and a person), we create a separate
relation for each type.
2Named entities not present in Freebase are ignored during
training.
5 Relation Clustering
Predicates are clustered into those which are seman-
tically equivalent, based on their argument-pairs in
a corpus. The initial semantic analysis is run over
the corpora, and for each predicate we build a vector
containing counts for each of its argument-pairs (we
divide these counts by the overall frequency of an
argument-pair in the corpus, so that rarer argument-
pairs are more significant). These vectors are used
to compute similarity between predicates.
First, we run the clustering algorithm on each lan-
guage independently, and then we attempt to find an
alignment between the clusters. Duc et al. (2011)
and Ta¨ckstro¨m et al. (2012) use similar two-step ap-
proaches. Running the clustering on both languages
simultaneously was found to produce many clusters
only containing predicates from a single language.
This appears to be because even if predicates in two
different languages are truth-conditionally equiva-
lent, the language biases the sample of entity-pairs
found in a corpus. For example, the French verb
e´crire may contain more French author/book pairs
than the English equivalent write. This difference
can make the verbs appear to represent different
predicates to the clustering algorithm. Our two-step
approach also means that advances in monolingual
clustering should directly lead to improved cross-
lingual clusters.
5.1 Monolingual Clustering
Following Lewis and Steedman (2013), we use the
Chinese Whispers algorithm (Biemann, 2006) for
monolingual clustering—summarized in Algorithm
1. The algorithm is non-parametric, meaning that
the number of relation clusters is induced from the
data, and highly scalable. We create a separate graph
for each type of predicate in each language—for
example, predicates between types AUTHOR and
BOOK in French (so only predicates with the same
type will be clustered). We create one node per pred-
icate in the graph, and edges represent the distribu-
tional similarity between the predicates.
The distributional similarity between a pair of
predicates is calculated as the cosine-similarity of
their argument pair vectors in the corpus. Many
more sophisticated approaches to determining sim-
ilarity have been proposed (Kotlerman et al., 2010;
684
Weisman et al., 2012), and future work should ex-
plore these. We prune nodes with less than 25 oc-
currences, edges of weight less than 0.05, and a short
list of stop predicates. We find many of our French
dependency paths do not have a clear semantic inter-
pretation, so add the requirement that dependency
paths contain at least one content word, contain at
most 5 edges, and that one of the dependencies con-
nected to the root is subject, object or the French
preposition de.

for monolingual predicate clustering. sim(p, p?) is
the distributional similarity between p and p?, and
1r=r? is 1 iff r=r’ and 0 otherwise
5.2 Cross-lingual Cluster Alignment
We use a simple greedy procedure to find an align-
ment between the monolingual clusters in different
languages. First, the entity-pair vectors for each
predicate in a relation cluster are merged. Then,
the cosine similarity between entity-pair vectors for
clusters in different languages is calculated—we
base this only on argument-pairs that occur in both
languages, to reduce the potential bias of some en-
tities being more relevant to one language. Clus-
ters are then greedily aligned, in order of their sim-
ilarity, as in Algorithm 2 (pruning similarities less
than 0.01). This means that clusters are aligned with
their most similar foreign cluster. We only attempt
to align clusters with the same argument types.

(Clark and Curran, 2004). The French corpus is
tagged with MElt (Denis et al., 2009) and parsed
with MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007), trained on the
French Treebank (Candito et al., 2010). Wikipedia
markup is filtered using Wikiprep (Gabrilovich and
Markovitch, 2007)—replacing internal links with
the name of their target article, to help entity link-
ing. Some example clusters learnt by our model are
shown in Table 1. We find that the cross-lingual
clusters typically contain more French expressions
than English, possibly due to the differing sizes of
the corpora—adjusting the parameters in Section 5
results in larger clusters, but introduces noise.
6.1 Experimental Setup
We evaluate our system on a cross-lingual question
answering task, similar to monolingual QA evalua-
tions by Poon and Domingos (2009) and Lewis and
685
Steedman (2013). A question is asked in language
L, and is answered by the system from a corpus of
language L’. Human annotators are shown the ques-
tion, answer entity, and the sentence that provided
the answer, and are then asked whether the answer
is a reasonable conclusion based on the sentence.
Whilst this task is much easier than full translation,
it is both a practical application for our approach,
and a reasonably direct extrinsic evaluation for our
cross-lingual clusters.
Following Poon and Domingos (2009) and Lewis
and Steedman (2013), the question dataset is auto-
matically generated from the corpus. This approach
has the advantage of evaluating on expressions in
proportion to their corpus frequency, so understand-
ing frequent expressions is more important than rare
ones. We then sample 1000 questions for each lan-
guage, by extracting binary relations matching cer-
tain patterns (X
nsub j
? verb
dob j
? Y, X
nsub j
? verb
pob j
? Y or
X
nsub j
? be
dob j
? noun
pob j
? Y), and removing one of the
arguments. For example, from the sentence Obama
lives in Washington we create the questions X lives
in Washington?, and Obama lives in X?.3 Answers
are judged by fluent bilingual humans, and do not
have to match the entity that originally instantiated
X. Multiple answers can be returned for the same
question.
Our system attempts this task by mapping both
the question and candidate answer sentences (which
will be in a different language to the question) on
to a logical form using the clusters, and determin-
ing whether they express the same relation. This
tests the ability of our approach to cluster expres-
sions into those which are semantically equivalent
between languages. It is possible for entities to have
multiple types (see Section 4.2), and answers are
ranked by the number of types in which the entail-
ment relation is predicted to hold.
3Questions are given in a declarative form, to make the tasks
simpler for the machine translation baseline. We found the
machine translation performed poorly on questions such as
What is Obama the president of?, as inverted word-orders and
long-range dependencies are difficult to handle with re-ordering
models and language models (though are straightforward to
handle for a CCG system (Clark et al., 2004)). We find that
machine translation performs much better on declarative equiv-
alents, such as: Obama is the president of X.
6.2 Baseline
Our baseline makes use of the Moses machine trans-
lation system (Koehn et al., 2007), and is similar
to previous approaches to cross-lingual question an-
swering such as Ahn et al. (2004). We train a Moses
model on the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005). First,
the question is translated from language L to L’,
taking the 50-best translations. As the questions
are typically shorter than corpus sentences, this is
substantially easier for the machine-translation than
translating the corpus. These are then parsed, and
patterns are extracted (as in Section 3). We also
manually supply a translation of the named-entity
in the question (based on the Freebase entity name
translation), to avoid penalizing the translation sys-
tem for failing to translate named-entities that have
not been seen in its training data. These patterns
are then used to find answers to the questions. An-
swers are ranked by the score of the best translation
that produced the pattern. Figure 2 illustrates this
pipeline.
The choice of languages is very favourable to
the machine-translation system, English and French
have similar word-order, and there is a large amount
of parallel text available (Koehn and Monz, 2006).
Our system works with any word-order, and does not
require parallel text for training, so we would expect
better performance relative to machine-translation
on other language pairs. Future work will experi-
ment with more diverse languages. The sentences to
be translated are also very short, reducing the poten-
tial for error.
6.3 Results
Results are shown in Table 3, based on a sample
of 100 answers from the output of each of the sys-
tems. Unsurprisingly, the machine-translation has
high accuracy on this task, given the choice of lan-
guages and the short queries. Pleasingly, our clusters
achieve similar accuracy, with much greater recall,
with no usage of parallel text.
Examining the results, we see that the distribu-
tion of answers is highly skewed for all systems,
with many answers to a smaller number of ques-
tions (multiple answers can be returned to the same
question). This is due to the Zipfian nature of lan-
guage, the difficulty of the task (which is far from

solved in the monolingual case), and the possibil-
ity that questions may have no answers in the for-
eign corpus. This is particuarly true for the cluster-
ing approach—although the clustering system finds
more answers with the English corpus, the baseline
system answers slightly more unique questions (57
vs 66). The 1032 answers found by the clusters
in the French corpus came from just 56 questions
(compared to 29 unique questions answered by the
baseline). This suggests that the translations found
by the clustering can be more useful than those of
Moses on this task—for example, it may find an
equivalence between a rare French term and a com-
mon related English term, where machine transla-
tion may only find a more literal translation.
Despite this, we see the clusters have learnt to
687
paraphrase a variety of relations between languages
with high accuracy, suggesting that there is much
potential for the use of unsupervised clusters in
cross-lingual semantic applications. Some examples
answers are given in Table 2. Most of the errors are
caused by a small number of questions.
7 Translation Reranking Experiments
Ultimately, we would like to be able to translate
using semantic parsing with cross-lingual clusters.
As a step towards this, we investigated whether we
could rerank the output of a machine translation sys-
tem, on the basis of whether the semantic parse of
the source sentence is consistent with that of candi-
date translations.
We sample French sentences where we can pro-
duce a semantic parse (i.e. we can extract a predicate
between named entities that maps to a cross-lingual
cluster). These sentences are translated to English
using Moses, taking the 50-best list, and semantic
parses are produced for each of these. If the seman-
tic parse for the 1-best translation does not match the
source semantic parse, we take the parse from the
50-best list that most closely matches it—otherwise
we discard the sentence from our evaluation, as our
semantics agrees with the machine-translation.
To ensure that the evaluation focuses on the clus-
ters, we try to exclude several other factors that
might affect the results. The coverage of our CCG
parsing and semantic analysis drops significantly on
noisy translated sentences, and potentially acts as a
language model by failing to produce any semantic
parse on ungrammatical output sentences. We there-
fore only consider sentences where we can produce
a semantic parse for the 1-best machine translation
output. We also try to avoid penalizing the machine-
translation system for failing to translate named en-
tities correctly, so we do not attempt to rerank sen-
tences where the entities from the source sentence
are not present in the 1-best translation.
Human annotators were shown the source sen-
tence, the 1-best translation, and the translation cho-
sen by the reranker (the translations were shown in
a random order). To focus the evaluation on the se-
mantic relations we are modelling, we ask the anno-
tators which sentence best preserves the meaning be-
tween the named entities that have different relations

penalized for choosing a translation that is worse in
aspects other than the relations it is modelling. An
example is shown in Table 4. The data was anno-
tated jointly by two fluent bilingual speakers, who
reported high agreement on this task.
Results are shown in Table 5, and are highly en-
couraging, with the original Moses output being pre-
ferred to the reranked translation in only 5% of cases
where our model makes a positive prediction.
Inspecting the results, we see that many of the
cases where the annotators had no preference were
caused by syntactic parse errors. For example, if
the 1-best translation is correct, but a prepositional
phrase is incorrectly attached, it will appear to have
an incorrect semantics. A similar translation in the
50-best list may be correctly parsed, and conse-
quently selected by our reranker. However, a human
will have no preference between these translations.
Incorporating K-Best parsing into our pipeline may
help mitigate against such cases.
This preliminary experiment suggests that there is
potential for future improvements in machine trans-
lation using cross-lingual distributional semantics.
The system only attempts to rerank a very small
proportion of sentences, but we believe the cover-
age could be greatly improved by including relations
between common nouns (rather than just named-
entities)—future work should explore this.

clustering typed predicates into those which are se-
mantically equivalent. We also show how to boot-
strap semantic information about entities from the
Wikipedia markup, and believe this makes it an in-
teresting corpus for future work on monolingual dis-
tributional semantics.
Cross-language Latent Relational Analysis (Duc
et al., 2011) is perhaps the most similar previous
work to ours, which moves the work of Turney
(2005) into a multilingual setting. Duc et al. (2011)
aim to compute, for example, that the ‘latent rela-
tion’ between (Obama, US) in an English corpus is
similar to that between (Cameron, UK) in a foreign
corpus. This is solved by finding all textual patterns
between the two entity-pairs, and computing their
overall similarity. Like us, they compute similarity
between expressions in different languages based on
named-entity arguments and clustering (unlike us,
they also rely on machine translation for comput-
ing similarity). A key difference is that their sys-
tem aims to understand the overall relation between
an entity-pair based on many observations, whereas
our approach attempts to understand each sentence
individually (as is required for tasks such as transla-
tion).
Various recent papers have explored the rela-
tionship between translation and monolingual para-
phrases —for example Bannard and Callison-Burch
(2005) create paraphrases by pivoting through a for-
eign translation, and Callison-Burch et al. (2006)
show that including monolingual paraphrases im-
proves the quality of translation by reducing spar-
sity. The success of these approaches depends on the
many-to-many relationship between equivalent ex-
pressions in different languages. Our approach aims
to model this relationship explicitly by clustering all
equivalent paraphrases in different languages.
Current state-of-the-art machine translation sys-
tems circumvent the problem of full semantic in-
terpretation, by using phrase-based models learnt
from large parallel corpora (Brown et al., 1993). Al-
though this approach has been very successful, it has
significant limitations—for example, when translat-
ing between languages with very different word-
orders (Birch et al., 2009), or with little parallel text.
Semantic machine translation aims to map the
source language to an interlingual semantic rep-
resentation, and then generate the target language
sentence from this. Jones et al. (2012) show how
this can be done on a small dataset using hyper-
edge replacement grammars. A major obstacle to
this is designing a suitable meaning representation,
which involves choosing a set of primitive concepts
which are abstract enough to be capable of express-
ing meaning in any language (Dorr et al., 2004).
A recent proposal for this is the Abstract Meaning
Representation (Banarescu et al., 2013), which uses
English verbs as a set of predicates. This is a less ab-
stract form of semantic interpretation than our pro-
posal, as semantically equivalent paraphrases may
be given a different representation. Such an ap-
proach also relies on annotating large amounts of
text with the semantic representation—whereas our
unsupervised approach offers a way to build such an
interlingua using only a method for extracting pred-
icates from sentences.
Whilst almost all recent work on machine-
translation has relied on parallel text, there have
been several interesting approaches that do not.
Rapp (1999) learns to translate words based on small
seed bilingual dictionary. Klementiev et al. (2012a)
exploit a variety of interesting indirect sources of
information to learn a lexicon—for example as-
suming that equivalent Wikipedia articles in differ-
ent languages will use semantically similar words.
The Polylingual Topic Model (Mimno et al., 2009)
makes use of similar intuitions. Whilst we exploit
equivalent Wikipedia articles for entity linking, we
do not require aligned articles. Incorporating such
techniques into our model would be a natural next
689
step, allowing us to learn a more complete lexicon.
To our knowledge, ours is the first approach to learn
to translate semantic relations, rather than words and
phrases.
Several other recent papers have learnt cross-
lingual word clusters, and used these to improve
cross-lingual tasks such as document-classification
(Klementiev et al., 2012b), parsing (Ta¨ckstro¨m et
al., 2012) and semantic role labelling (Kozhevnikov
and Titov, 2013) in resource-poor languages. Cross-
lingual word clusters are learnt by aligning mono-
lingual clusters on the basis of parallel text—in
language-pairs where parallel text is available, this
offers an interesting complement to our method of
clustering based on named entities.
9 Conclusions and Future Work
We have demonstated that our previous work on
monolingual distributional semantics can simply be
extended to learn a language-independent semantics
of relations from unlabelled text, and that this se-
mantics is powerful enough to aid applications such
as question answering and translation reranking.
There is much potential for future extensions to
address the limitations of the process described here.
As we use a flat clustering of relations, we are
only able to model synonyms and not hypernyms.
More sophisticated clustering techniques, such as
those used by Berant et al. (2011), seem to offer
a way to address this. Our system clusters rela-
tions with similar named-entity arguments, but this
means it does not cluster relations whose arguments
are rarely named entities. However, using cross-
lingual clusters of common nouns, such as those
from Ta¨ckstro¨m et al. (2012), it should be possible to
cluster relations that take semantically similar com-
mon noun arguments. Embedding cluster-identifiers
in a logical form allows us to also model logical op-
erators, such as negation and quantifiers, which may
help to improve the translation of these. It would
also be interesting to experiment with more diverse
languages types.
