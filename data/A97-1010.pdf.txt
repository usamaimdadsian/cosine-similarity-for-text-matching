Repair processing plays an important role in 
spoken language processing systems. This 
paper proposes a method for correcting 
Chinese repetition repairs and demonstrates 
the effects of repair processing in Chinese 
homophone disambiguation. The 
experimental results show that the precision 
rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90•65% 
can be achieved for the repair processing. 
At the same time, 50% of errors in the 
repairing segments can be reduced for 
Chinese homophone disambiguation. 
1 Introduction 
Repair is a very common phenomenon in spoken 
languages. Speakers usually repeat, add, replace, or 
even abandon some constructions in the utterances for 
some mental reasons. Typical repairs in Chinese 
spoken data' are shown in (1) and (2).

(I am sometimes addicted to drinking.) 
The transcription system proposed by Bois, et al. (1992) is used to 
transcribe the spoken data. The three symbols ...(N) .... and .. 
denote an unfilled pause (silence) is long, medium and short, 
respectively. The symbol % denotes the glottal stop.

Heeman and Allen (1994) describe that 25% of 
turns contain at least one speech repair in their corpus. 
In our study, 17% of turns contain at least one speech 
repair• Thus, the repair processing cannot be 
negligible and has influences to a certain extent. 
Recently, text-first approach and speech-first 
approach ave been proposed to touch on repairs in 
English. The text-first approach assumes the speech 
recognizer could provide a correct ranscription. That 
is, it tries to detect and correct speech repairs 
automatically using text alone• Hindle (1983) adds 
rules to a deterministic parser to tackle the problem of 
correcting speech repairs. His parsing strategy 
depends on the successful disambiguation of the 
syntactic categories. Although syntactic categories 
can be determined well by local context, Hindle admits 
that speech repair disrupts the local context. Bear, et 
al. (1992) firstly try to parse the input sentence and 
then invoke a repair processing when the parsing fails• 
For repair processing, a simple pattern matcher finds 
the candidates based on the lexical cues at the first 
stage. Then the syntactic and semantic processing 
filters out the impossible candidates. Heeman and 
Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and 
corrects modification and abridged repairs. The 
algorithm uses some repair patterns to capture potential 
repairs. These patterns are built based on the 
identification of word fragments, editing terms 2, and 
word correspondences between the repaired segment 
2 The editing terms can either be filled pauses (e.g., urn, un, er) or 
cue phrases (e.g., I mean, 1guess, well). 
57 
and the repairing segment 3. The resulting potential 
repairs are then passed to a statistical filter that judges 
the proposal as either fluent speech or an actual repair. 
The speech-first approach tries to identify speech 
repairs using acoustic and prosodic cues. Nakatani 
and Hirschberg (1993a; 1993b) investigate the 
detection of the interruption point of speech repairs 
based on this line. The cues that they found are the 
occurrence of a filled pause, the presence of a word 
fragment, the energy peaks in each word and other 
features uch as accent. However, they do not address 
the problem of correcting speech repairs. In other 
words, they do not determine which words are 
undesired. 
These approaches cannot be adopted to deal with 
Chinese speech repairs for the following reasons. 
First, a Chinese sentence is composed of a string of 
characters without any word boundaries. In other 
words, it is necessary to segment Chinese sentence 
before tagging and parsing (Chen and Liu, 1992; Sproat, 
et al., 1994; Chen and Lee, 1996). Repairs make 
segmentation and text-first approach more difficult. 
Second, Chinese repairs may not always have an 
editing terms between a repaired segment and a 
repairing segment. In other words, editing terms do 
not have much effect in Chinese repair processing. 
Third, duplicate constructions (e.g., ~'~\['I~ (bangl 
bangl mang2, help), \]i~:~\]i~:,~ (yan2 jiu4 yah2 jiu4, 
study)) generated by repeating words or phrases in 
Chinese utterances are used very often, but they do not 
always initiate a repair. That is, a simple pattern 
matching mechanism cannot be workable. Forth, the 
Chinese speech repairs may be initiated at various 
syntactic environment (Chui, 1995), e.g., before the 
subject, during the subject, after the subject and before 
the verb, during the verb, during a direct object, during 
a prepositional phrase, during subordination, and so on. 
The variety makes the identification of Chinese speech 
repairs more troublesome. 
Because the repairs introduce much noise in 
language processing, we cannot defer the task of repair 
processing to the latter stages. This paper employs 
acoustic and prosodic information to correct Chinese 
repetition repairs. The results are applied to Chinese 
homophone disambiguation. Section 2 defines four 
major types of speech repairs. Section 3 introduces 
the spoken corpus. Sections 4 and 5 describe the 
3 A repair is composed of a repaired segment and a repairing 
segment which immediately follows the repaired segment. A 
repaired segment denotes the portion of the utterance which is being 
repaired, and a repairing segment denotes the portion which is 
accomplishing the repair (Fox and Jasperson, forthcoming). That is. 
the repaired segment is replaced by the repairing segment. 
baseline and the advanced models for repetition repairs, 
respectively. Section 6 demonstrates the effects of 
repair processing in Chinese homophone 
disambiguation. Section 7 concludes the remarks. 
2 Types of Chinese Speech Repairs 
Heeman and Allen (1994) divide English speech repairs 
into three types: fresh start, modification repair and 
abridged repair. For Chinese speech repairs, Chui 
(1995) classify them into eleven patterns. In this 
section, we map these eleven patterns into four major 
types according to their surface forms. 
Let A, B, C, D, X and Y be character strings and 
# be interruption point ~. The four major types of 
speech repairs are described below. The repair, the 
repaired segment and the repairing segment are in 
unde\[lin_e , italic and boldface, respectively. They 
appear within an utterance or between two consecutive 
utterances. 
(a) Repetition Repair 
The repetition repair can be represented asfollows: 
XA#AY 
The repetition can range from a portion of a word up to 
several words. After being repaired, the utterances 
become XAY. (1) and (2) are two examples. 
(b) Addition Repair 
There are two types of addition repairs. 
(i) The type I addition repair 
represented asfollows: 
can be 
XAB#ACBY 
After being repaired, the utterances become 
XACBY. (3) shows an example. 
(3) \[^~ -~,- 
He say 
..,~ @~\] ~ ~,- 
He today until say 
...,,~ :~ ~ ~ ~ ~: ~=.\ 
most not like drink DE SHI he 
(He said .. Until today he said that he is the 
one who dislikes drinking most.) 
4 The end of the repaired segment is called the interruption point. It 
is often accompanied by a disruption i the intonation contour. 
58 
(ii) The type II addition repair can be 
represented asfollows: 
XA#BAY 
After being repaired, the utterances become 
XBAY. 
(c) Replacement Repair 
There are five types of replacement repairs. 
(i) The type I replacement repair can 
represented asfollows: 
be 
XAB#ACY 
After being repaired, the utterances become XACY. 
(4) shows an example. 
(4) . .~  ~%- 
We wait 
. . \ [~\ ]  ~ . \  
We chat 
(We wait .. We chat.) 
(ii) The type II replacement repair can be 
represented asfollows: 
XAB#CBY 
After being repaired, the utterances become 
XCBY. 
(iii) The type III replacement repair can be 
represented asfollows: 
XABC#ADCY 
After being repaired, the utterances become 
XADCY. 
(iv) The type IV replacement repair can be 
represented asfollows: 
X,4BC#ACY 
After being repaired, the utterances become 
XACY. 
(v) Different from the above replacement 
repairs, the repaired segment and the repairing 
segment in this type do not match any characters. 
It can be represented asfollows: 
XA#BY 
After being repaired, the utterances become XBY. 
(5) shows an example. 
(5) • .~--

(They .. Her major is not Computer Science.) 
(d) Abandon Repair 
The original utterance is discarded and a new utterance 
is initiated. (6) shows an example. 
(6) ...(.9)~J~J~ ;\[-<~\]~ --Yt~--

3 Spoken Corpus 
The spoken corpus used in this paper consists of two 
commonplace, veryday conversations among friends. 
Each is about forty-minute long. There are four and 
five speakers in these two conversations, respectively. 
In total, this corpus contains 5,395 utterances, 22,409 
words and 2,602 turns. There are totally 440 self- 
. 5 repairs. On the average, 17% of turns contain at least 
one repair. Table 1 lists the frequency distribution of 
each type of repairs in two conversations.

2) of the repairs. Addition (Replacement) repairs have 
13.69% (9.52%) and 9.56% (8.09%) in conversations l 
and 2, respectively. The rest (4.17% in conversation l 
and 9.19% in conversation 2) are the most complex 
type of repairs, i.e., Abandon. Because this paper 
corrects repairs based on acoustic and prosodic cues, 
the Chinese characters in the spoken corpus are 
converted into the corresponding syllables manually". 
4 Basel ine Model  
4.1 Simple Pattern Matching 
Because the repetition repairs form the majority, we 
focus on the repetition repairs in this paper. Although 
the repetition repairs have the simple surface form, 
correcting such a kind of speech repairs is not trivial. 
That is, a simple pattern matching mechanism cannot 
work perfectly. Table 2 explains this point. A repair 
is proposed when a string of syllables repeats within an 
utterance or between two consecutive utterances. 
Table 2. The Experimental Results Using Simple 
Pattern Matching 
Conversation II II  ro osoo 
1 122 243 
2 199 412 
Total II II 655 
Correct 
118 
196 
314 
Columns 2, 3 and 4 denote the total repetition repairs, 
the number of repairs proposed by the simple pattern 
marcher and the number of correct proposed repairs, 
respectively. For example, 243 repairs are proposed 
by the simple pattern marcher in conversation 1, but 
only 118 of them are correct. That is, there are 125 
false alarms. Since there are 122 repetition repairs in 
conversation I, 4 repetition repairs are not captured. 
They are all English repairs. Because only Chinese 
repairs are considered, English repairs are lost. 
Although this technique can achieve recall rate of 
97.82%, it has a relatively low precision rate, i.e., 
47.94%. 
Since the simple pattern matching mechanism 
cannot solve this problem properly, two additional cues 
are firstly considered in the baseline model: the length 
of the repeated syllable string and the number of inter- 
utterances. 
6 Because we focus our efforts on correcting speech repairs, the 
identification f acoustic and prosodic cues does not discuss in this 
paper. 
4.2 The Length of the Repeated Syllable 
String 
How many syllables are repeated in the repetition 
repairs is an interesting problem in cognition, Table 3 
lists the distribution of length of the repeated syllable 
strings in the repetition repairs. 
Table 3. The Distribution of Length of the Repeated 
Syllable Strings 
Conversation\Length\[\[ 1 \[ 2 I 3 14 
1 71 40 6 1 
2 107 72 15 2 
Total II 178 I 112 I 21 I 3 
The length ranges from 1 to 4. Thus, when a string of 
syllables repeats and the length of this string is greater 
than 4, we do not regard it as a repetition repair. 
4.3 The Number of Inter-Utterances 
In human conversation, most of the repetition repairs 
occur within an utterance or between two consecutive 
utterances of one speaker without interrupting by other 
speakers. That is, if many utterances i sued by other 
speakers are inserted between two utterances of the 
same speaker, the repetition repairs usually do not 
occur. The spoken corpus shows this point. 
• Total 13.69% of repetition repairs occur in the 
same utterance. 
• Total 71.66% of repetition repairs occur 
between two consecutive utterances without 
interrupting by other speakers. 
• Only 0.32% of repetition repairs occur across 
more than 3 utterances issued by other 
speakers. 
According to the heuristic rule, when more than 3 
utterances pronounced by other speakers interrupt he 
speech of a speaker, we do not check whether there is a 
repetition repair or not. 
5 Advanced Model  
5.1 Unfilled Pause (...) 
In spontaneous or conversational speech, we find that 
there is a significant unfilled pause (silence) between a
repaired segment and a repairing segment for repetition 
60 
repairs 7,whereas actual or intended repeated characters 
(syllables) usually do not have any unfilled pauses 
between them. (1) and (2) are examples. After the 
unfilled pause information is added to the baseline 
model, the experimental results for two conversations 
are listed below.

244 
The experimental results show that the precision rate is 
increased to 84.14%, and the recall rate is decreased to 
76.01%. 
5.2 Glottal Stop (%)  
Glottal stop has the similar functions to unfilled pause. 
That is, a glottal stop may occur between the repaired 
segment and the repairing segment for the repetition 
repairs, whereas actual repeated characters usually do 
not have such a marker between them. (1) is an 
example. Table 5 shows the results when the glottal 
stop information is used to enhance the baseline model.

113 
From Table 5, we find that glottal stop is a more 
reliable cue than unfilled pause, but it does not occur as 
frequently as unfilled pause. These points are verified 
by the high precision rate (97.41%) and the low recall 
rate (35.20%). When the unfilled pause information 
and the glottal stop information are all applied to the 
baseline model, the experimental results for two 
conversations are listed in Table 6. Both the precision 
rate (84.71%) and the recall rate (82.87%) are all better 
than those in the former models. 
7 Because the filled pauses uch as urn, un and er do not occur 
frequently inthe spoken corpus, the effects of filled pauses are not 
demonstrated in this paper.

5.3 Two Consecut ive Equal  Utterances 
If two consecutive utterances are equal, repetition 
repairs usually do not occur within and between them 
when the length of the utterances i long enough. This 
is because the matched string usually denotes an 
emphasis when it is long enough. This cue can 
eliminate some implausible repairs, so that the 
precision rate can be increased. 
5.4 Cue Patterns 
In Chinese conversation, some words or phrases are 
frequently repeated, but they are not repairs. Typical 
examples are interjections (e.g., ~ (o2, oh)) and 
phrase-final particles (e.g., ~I (a5, a)). These 
patterns called type I cue patterns are used to increase 
the precision rate. That is, a repair is proposed when a 
string of syllables repeats, satisfies the criteria of 
baseline model, unfilled pause and glottal stop, and the 
first syllable of the string does not belong to type I cue 
patterns. 
In contrast to type I cue patterns, another kind of 
patterns, type II cue patterns, are also considered to 
increase the recall rate. That is, some repeated 
syllable strings that do not satisfy the criteria of unfilled 
pause and glottal stop, but they are usually repetition 
repairs. Typical examples are pronouns such as 
(wo3, I) and '\[g (ni3, you). Based on type II cue 
patterns, some additional repairs can be proposed when 
a string of syllables repeats, it does not satisfy the 
criteria of unfilled pause and glottal stop, but the first 
syllable of the string belongs to type II cue patterns. 
When all the cues proposed in the previous 
subsections are all applied to the baseline model, the 
final experimental results are listed in Table 7.

The experimental results show that the precision 
rate of 93.87% and the recall rate of 90.65% can be 
achieved. 
6 Repair Processing in Chinese 
Homophone Disambiguation 
Mandarin Chinese has approximately 1,300 syllables, 
13,094 commonly used characters, and more than 
100,000 words. Each character is pronounced as a 
syllable and many syllables are shared by several 
characters. Some syllables correspond to even more 
than 100 characters. Thus, Chinese homophone 
disambiguation is difficult but important in a Chinese 
phonetic input method and a Chinese speech 
recognition system. 
The problem of Chinese homophone 
disambiguation is defined as how to convert a sequence 
of syllables S into the corresponding sequence of 
characters ~ correctly. Thus, Chinese homophone 
disambiguation can be regarded as a process of 
conversion of syllable-to-character. Let S=<s I, s 2, 
s3, ..., Sn> be a syllable string and C=<Cl, c 2, c 3 ..... Cn> 
be one corresponding character string. Here, s i 
denotes one of 1,300 Chinese syllables and c i denotes 
one of 13,094 Chinese characters. The conversion can 
be formulated as follows. 
= argmax P(CIS) 
C 
P(SIC)*P(C) 
argmax

The denominator part does not effect he maximization 
and it merely serves as a constant multiplier. The 
above formula therefore becomes as follows. 
only. Because repairs introduce much noise, direct 
application of this method without repair processing is
expected to have worse performance s . 
For evaluating the effects of repair processing in 
this application, we count how many syllables in the 
repairing segments are wrongly converted and how 
many wrongly converted syllables are recovered after 
the repair processing. The experimental results are 
listed below".

Column 2 (Wrong) denotes the number of wrongly 
converted syllables before the repair processing. 
Columns 3 and 4 then indicate the performance hanges. 
They are classified into two types: Wrong-to-Correct 
(WC) and Correct-to-Wrong (CW). In the WC type, a 
wrongly converted syllable is changed to the correct 
one by the repair processing. In the CW type, a 
syllable which is correctly converted before repair 
processing, is changed to a wrong one after the repair 
processing. The performance of the repair processing 
can be evaluated as the net gain shown as follows. 
Net Gain = # of WC - # of CW 
In Table 8, the number of the original errors is 126. 
After the repair processing, the number of the errors is 
reduced to 63. That is, 63 (50%) errors are recovered 
by the repair processing. It reveals that the repair 
processing has much effect in these experiments. 
- argmax P(SIC)*P(C) 
C 
As most Chinese characters are unambiguous in their 
pronunciation (Sproat, 1990), we assume that P(SIC) is 
one in general case. Finally, this formula is simplified 
as a Markov character bigram model shown below.

7 Concluding Remarks 
Any spoken language systems will not perform well 
without treating speech repairs. Correcting speech 
repairs make more reliable environments for the 
subsequent processing. This paper employs acoustic 
and prosodic cues to correct the repetition repairs. 
The experimental results show that our method can

disfluencies reduces perplexity. 
9 The Academia Sinica Balance Corpus (1995) is adopted as the 
training corpus in this experiment. It contains text of several 
categories and includes approximately 360,000 sentences comprising 
of about 3,300,000 characters.

achieve the precision rate of 93.87% and the recall rate 
of 90.65%. At the same time, 50% of errors in the 
repairing segment can be reduced for the Chinese 
homophone disambiguation. 
O'Shaughnessy (1992) claims that most speech 
repairs do not have lengthening prior to the hesitation 
pause. If this cue is used in our model, it can slightly 
increase the precision rate (95.37%), but the recall rate 
(76.95%) is greatly decreased. 
Although our method can perform well in 
repetition repairs, other kinds of repairs such as 
addition, replacement and abandon repairs are not 
addressed in this paper. They have more complex 
surface forms and should be investigated further.
