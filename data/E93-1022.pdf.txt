Abstract 
An algorithm for automatic 
identification of topic and focus of 
the sentence ispresented, based on 
dependency syntax and using 
written input, which is much more 
ambiguous than spoken utterance. 
1. The dichotomy of topic and focus, based, 
in the Praguean Functional Generative 
Description, on the scale of communicative 
dynamism (underlying word order), is relevant 
not only for a possible placement of the 
sentence in a context, but also for its semantic 
interpretation. 
The underlying word order differs from 
• the surface one especially in that the verb 
stands moreto  the right than all its 
complementations belonging to the topic of the 
sentence (or to the local topic of the clause 
headed by the verb), and more to the left than 
those belonging to the focus. Using a 
dependency grammar (or, more or less 
equivalently, a flat structure in a constituency 
based grammar), we can illustrate this by the 
following example, where (1') is a simplified 
underlying representation of (1) on a reading 
answering e.g. the question Where has Charles 
found my pen ?: 
(1) Charles has found your pen in a box lying 
on the table. 
(1') (Charles)Act ((you)App,a pen)Obj find.Pelf 
Ceox.Indef ((Rel)Act lie (table)L~.o,)c~o, )L~.~, 
In (1') every pair of parentheses ncompasses 
a dependent item (i.e. corresponds to an edge 
of the linearized ependency tree), the indices 
of parentheses denote kinds of dependency 
(valency slots, or theta roles and adjuncts): 
Act stands for Actor (underlying Subject), 
Appurt for Appurtenance (Possessivity in a 
broader sense), Obj for Objective (underlying 
~Object), Loc for Locative, Gener for the 
General Relationship (of an adjunct to its 
head); the other indices denote values of 
morphological categories (Perfect, 
Indefiniteness) and of adverbial prepositions 
(in, on), Rel denotes a relative pronoun (here 
178 
deleted on the surface). For more details of 
the descriptive framework used, see Sgall et 
al. (1986, Chapters 2 and 3). 
An automatic identification of topic and 
focus may use the input information on surface 
word order, on the dependency relations 
between autosemantic lexical occurrences, on 
the systemic ordering of kinds of 
complementations (reflected by the underlying 
order of the items included in the focus), on 
definiteness, on lexical semantic properties of 
words and (if spoken input is used) on the 
position of the intonation center (sentence 
stress). The primary position of the intonation 
center is at the end of the sentence (where it 
need not be phonetically realized by a specific 
stress), but also in another (secondary) 
position the intonation center marks the most 
dynamic part of the sentence (focus proper), 
cf. (2), where the underlying order is as 
indicated by (2'): 
(2) Charles has found your PEN in a box lying 
on the table. 
(2') (Charles) (box ((Rel) (table) lie)) find 
((you) pen) 
After several years of research in this 
domain, which has included psycholinguistic 
experiments with Czech and German 
sentences, as well as investigations with native 
speakers of English, we are convinced that in 
the individual languages there exists a basic 
ordering of the kinds of complementations of 
every verb (noun, adjective). We assume that 
this ordering, called systemic ordering, 
directly determines the underlying word order 
in the focus, so that if a sentence part A 
follows another one, B, under systemic 
ordering, then B is less dynamic than A (i.e. 
B precedes A in the underlying word order) 
only if B belongs to the topic. In the topic part 
of the sentence the underlying word order 
often differs from systemic ordering. The 
systemic ordering of some of the main kinds 
of complementations in English has the 
following shape: Time - Actor- Addressee - 
Objective- Origin - Effect Manner 
Directional(from) - Means - Directional(to) - 
Locative 
2. An automatic identification of topic, 
focus and the degrees of communicative 
dynamism, discussed in a preliminary way by 
Haji6ova and Sgall (1985), can be based on 
the following considerations: In languages with 
a high degree of "free" word order (as in most 
Slavonic languages), a secondary position of 
the intonation center is frequent only in spoken 
dialogues. In technical texts (spoken or 
written) there is a strong tendency to arrange 
the words so that the intonation center falls on 
the last word of the sentence (where it need 
not be phonetically manifested), of course with 
the exception of enclitic words. 
A general procedure for determining the 
topic-focus articulation in such languages can 
then be formulated as follows: 
(i) All complementations (participants and 
adverbials, or arguments and adjuncts) 
preceding the verb are contextually bound. As 
for the complementations following the verb, 
a "main rule" may be stated: the boundary 
between topic (to the left) and focus (to the 
right) can be drawn between any two 
elements, provided that those belonging to the 
focus are arranged in the surface word order 
in accordance with systemic ordering of the 
kinds of complementations. 
(ii) The verb is ambiguous as for its 
position in the topic or in the focus. 
(iii) If a spoken utterance (with its 
intonation center identified) is analyzed, then 
similar regularities hold for sentences with 
normal intonation (intonation center at the 
end). However, if a non-finai element carries 
the intonation center, then all the 
complementations standing after this element 
are contextually bound; for the rest of the 
sentence, (i) and (ii) hold; the bearer of the 
intonation center belongs to the focus. 
In English the surface word order is 
determined by grammatical rules to a large 
179 
extent, so that intonation plays a more decisive 
role than in the Slavonic languages. The 
written shape of the sentence does not suffice 
here to determine the topic-focus articulation 
to such a degree as e.g. in Czech. The "main 
rule" also applies, but otherwise only certain 
important regularities can be stated here on the 
basis of word order and grammatical values 
(especially the articles and other determiners). 
In order to be able to reduce the ambiguity 
of the written shape of the English sentence as 
much as possible, it is also necessary to take 
into account certain semantic lues: especially 
with Locative and the Temporal modifications, 
it is important to distinguish between specific 
information (e.g. on a nice September day, on 
October 22, 1991, seven months ago) and 
items containing just a general setting (e.g. 
always) or being directly (as indexicals) 
determined from the utterance (here, today, 
this year). The latter examples usually belong 
to the topic, the former ones typically 
occurring in the focus. As for the verb, it is 
important o have access to the verb of the 
preceding utterance: if the main verb of 
sentence n has the same meaning as (or a 
meaning included in) that of sentence n- 1, then 
it belongs to the topic; also verbs with very 
general exical meanings (such as be, have, 
happen, carry out, become) may be handled as 
belonging to the topic. Otherwise (i.e. in the 
unmarked case), the verb generally belongs to 
the focus. 
3. In the output of the algorithmic 
procedure completing the parsing of a written 
English sentence, many ambiguities remain, 
but it is known that sentences (even in their 
spoken shape) often are ambiguous as for their 
topic-focus articulation, so that it should be 
understood as a good result if the procedure 
identifies such an ambiguity. The algorithm 
has been formulated as follows: 
(a) The input to our part of the parser is 
assumed to have passed through the preceding 
parts, by which the dependency structure of 
the sentence has been identified, so that also 
the underlying dependency relations (valency 
positions) of the complementations (to the 
governing verb) are known. 
(b) If the verb occupies the rightmost 
position in the sentence and its subject is 
(ba) definite (including noun groups with 
this, one of the, etc.), then the verb belongs to 
the focus getting the index f, and its subject 
belongs to the topic, which we denote by the 
index t; 
(bb) indef'mite, then the subject is 
(indexed by) f and the verb is t. In either case, 
the other complementations are handled 
according to (cb) below. 
(c) If the verb does not occupy the 
rightmost position, then: 
(ca) the verb itself is understood as t, if 
it has a very general lexical meaning (see 
above), or as f if its meaning is very specific, 
or else the verb is characterized as 
intermediate, i.e. ambiguous, abbreviated as 
(t/0; 
(cb) the eomplementations preceding the 
verb are denoted as t, with the exception of an 
indefinite subject and of a specific (i.e. neither 
general nor highly indexical, see above) 
Temporal complementation; either of the latter 
two is characterized as t/f; 
(cc) to the right of the verb, 
(i) i f  there is a s ing le  
complementation, and this is a personal 
pronoun or another definite noun group, then 
it is t or t/f, respectively; 
(ii) if the rightmost complementation 
is Temp or Loc, then if it is specific, it is f 
and otherwise it is t; if it is another kind of 
complementation, then if it is indefinite, it is 
f and if definite, it is t/f; 
(iii) if there is such an ordered pair 
A,B to the right of the verb that falls to follow 
systemic ordering (see Section 2 and the "main 
rule" above), and B has not been assigned the 
index t according to (ii), then, for the 
rightmost such pair, A belongs to the topic (t), 
and so do all the complementations between A
and the verb; the rightmost complementation 
180 
of the whole sentence is f (only a personal 
pronoun following another one is t/f in this 
position), all those standing between A and the 
rightmost one are t/f; 
(iv) if (iii) does not apply then all 
remaining complementations to the right of the 
verb are t/f. 
(d) If all the complementations have been 
determined as t, then 
(da) if the verb was t/f after point (ca) 
and the rightmost complementation is a 
definite noun group, an indexical word or 
pronoun, then this rightmost element gets f 
(this result is abbreviated as t(f)); 
(db) if (da) does not apply, then both the 
rightmost element of the sentence and its verb 
get t/f. 
(e) The remaining representations 
containing no f are discarded. 
(f) The complementations with the index t 
are shifted to the left of the verb, those with f, 
to the right of it. 
Let us add that our algorithm only 
determines the appurtenance of an element to 
the topic or to the focus, but does not specify 
the underlying word order within topic. When 
implemented (together with a simplified 
parser), the algorithm was checked with a set 
of sentences, and it yielded the expected 
results, cf. the following examples (the 
notation of which is simplified in that the 
indices characterizing the underlying structure 
(cf. (1') above) are left out). NOTE: Our 
examples concern written English sentences. In
its present form, the algorithm handles only 
the verb and the parts of sentence immediately 
depending on it; deeper embedded items (esp. 
adjuncts of nouns) are left aside for the time 
being. 
Examples: 
(A) Charles found the pen in a box. 
The steps of the analysis (mostly in a 
simplified notation, without the grammatical 
indices): 
after the application of 
(a): (Charles)Act find.Pret (pen.Indef)obj 
Coox) .m 
(ca): Charles find.t/f pen box 
(cb): Charles.t find.t/f pen box 
(cc)(ii) Charles.t find.t/f pen box.f 
(iv) Charles.t find.t/f pen.t/f box.f 
(f) and resolution of the abbreviation t/f: 
Charles.t find.f pen.f box.f (e.g. 
answering: Why are the children so 
happy ?) 
Charles.t pen.t find.f box.f (e.g. 
answering: How did Charles get the 
pen?) 
Charles.t find.t pen.f box.f (e.g. 
answering: What did Charles find 
where?) 
Charles.t pen.t find.t box.f (e.g. 
answering: Where did Charles find 
the pen ?)
