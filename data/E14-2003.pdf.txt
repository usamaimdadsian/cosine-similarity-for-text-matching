Abstract
This paper presents the linguistic analysis
infrastructure developed within the XLike
project. The main goal of the imple-
mented tools is to provide a set of func-
tionalities supporting the XLike main ob-
jectives: Enabling cross-lingual services
for publishers, media monitoring or de-
veloping new business intelligence appli-
cations. The services cover seven major
and minor languages: English, German,
Spanish, Chinese, Catalan, Slovenian, and
Croatian. These analyzers are provided
as web services following a lightweigth
SOA architecture approach, and they are
publically accessible and shared through
META-SHARE.

1 Introduction
Project XLike
2
goal is to develop technology able
to gather documents in a variety of languages and
genres (news, blogs, tweets, etc.) and to extract
language-independent knowledge from them, in
order to provide new and better services to pub-
lishers, media monitoring, and business intelli-
gence. Thus, project use cases are provided by
STA (Slovenian Press Agency) and Bloomberg, as
well as New York Times as an associated partner.
Research partners in the project are Jo?zef Ste-
fan Institute (JSI), Karlsruhe Institute of Technol-
ogy (KIT), Universitat Polit`ecnica de Catalunya
(UPC), University of Zagreb (UZG), and Tsinghua
University (THU). The Spanish company iSOCO
is in charge of integration of all components de-
veloped in the project.
This paper deals with the language technology
developed within the project XLike to convert in-

put documents into a language-independent rep-
resentation that afterwards enables knowledge ag-
gregation.
To achieve this goal, a bench of linguistic pro-
cessing pipelines is devised as the first step in the
document processing flow. Then, a cross-lingual
semantic annotation method, based on Wikipedia
and Linked Open Data (LOD), is applied. The
semantic annotation stage enriches the linguistic
anaylsis with links to knowledge bases for differ-
ent languages, or links to language independent
representations.
2 Linguistic Analyzers
Apart from basic state-of-the-art tokenizers, lem-
matizers, PoS/MSD taggers, and NE recogniz-
ers, each pipeline requires deeper processors able
to build the target language-independent seman-
tic representantion. For that, we rely on three
steps: dependency parsing, semantic role label-
ing and word sense disambiguation. These three
processes, combined with multilingual ontologi-
cal resouces such as different WordNets and Pred-
icateMatrix (L´opez de la Calle et al., 2014), a
lexical semantics resource combining WordNet,
FrameNet, and VerbNet, are the key to the con-
struction of our semantic representation.
2.1 Dependency Parsing
We use graph-based methods for dependency
parsing, namely, MSTParser
3
(McDonald et al.,
2005) is used for Chinese and Croatian, and
Treeler
4
is used for the other languages. Treeler is
a library developed by the UPC team that imple-
ments several statistical methods for tagging and
parsing.
We use these tools in order to train dependency
parsers for all XLike languages using standard
available treebanks.

2.2 Semantic Role Labeling
As with syntactic parsing, we are developing SRL
methods with the Treeler library. In order to train
models, we will use the treebanks made available
by the CoNLL-2009 shared task, which provided
data annotated with predicate-argument relations
for English, Spanish, Catalan, German and Chi-
nese. No treebank annotated with semantic roles
exists for Slovene or Croatian. A prototype of
SRL has been integrated in all pipelines (except
the Slovene and Croatian pipelines). The method
implemented follows a pipeline architecture de-
scribed in (Llu´?s et al., 2013).
2.3 Word Sense Disambiguation
Word sense disambiguation is performed for all
languages with a publicly available WordNet. This
includes all languages in the project except Chi-
nese. The goal of WSD is to map specific lan-
guages to a common semantic space, in this case,
WN synsets. Thanks to existing connections be-
tween WN and other resources, SUMO and Open-
CYC sense codes are also output when available.
Thanks to PredicateMatrix, the obtained con-
cepts can be projected to FrameNet, achieving a
normalization of the semantic roles produced by
the SRL (which are treebank-dependent, and thus,
not the same for all languages). The used WSD
engine is the UKB (Agirre and Soroa, 2009) im-
plementation provided by FreeLing (Padr´o and
Stanilovsky, 2012).
2.4 Frame Extraction
The final step is to convert all the gathered linguis-
tic information into a semantic representation. Our
method is based on the notion of frame: a seman-
tic frame is a schematic representation of a situ-
ation involving various participants. In a frame,
each participant plays a role. There is a direct cor-
respondence between roles in a frame and seman-
tic roles; namely, frames correspond to predicates,
and participants correspond to the arguments of
the predicate. We distinguish three types of par-
ticipants: entities, words, and frames.
Entities are nodes in the graph connected to
real-world entities as described in Section 3.
Words are common words or concepts, linked to
general ontologies such as WordNet. Frames cor-
respond to events or predicates described in the
document. Figure 1 shows an example sentence,
the extracted frames and their arguments.
It is important to note that frames are a more
general representation than SVO-triples. While
SVO-triples represent a binary relation between
two participants, frames can represent n-ary rela-
tions (e.g. predicates with more than two argu-
ments, or with adjuncts). Frames also allow repre-
senting the sentences where one of the arguments
is in turn a frame (as is the case with plan to make
in the example).
Finally, although frames are extracted at sen-
tence level, the resulting graphs are aggregated
in a single semantic graph representing the whole
document via a very simple coreference resolution
based on detecting named entity aliases and repe-
titions of common nouns. Future improvements
include using an state-of-the-art coreference reso-
lution module for languages where it is available.
3 Cross-lingual Semantic Annotation
This step adds further semantic annotations on top
of the results obtained by linguistic processing.
All XLike languages are covered. The goal is
to map word phrases in different languages into
the same semantic interlingua, which consists of
resources specified in knowledge bases such as
Wikipedia and Linked Open Data (LOD) sources.
Cross-lingual semantic annotation is performed in
two stages: (1) first, candidate concepts in the
knowledge base are linked to the linguistic re-
sources based on a newly developed cross-lingual
linked data lexica, called xLiD-Lexica, (2) next
the candidate concepts get disambiguated based
on the personalized PageRank algorithm by utiliz-
ing the structure of information contained in the
knowledge base.
The xLiD-Lexica is stored in RDF format and
contains about 300 million triples of cross-lingual
groundings. It is extracted from Wikipedia dumps
of July 2013 in English, German, Spanish, Cata-
lan, Slovenian and Chinese, and based on the
canonicalized datasets of DBpedia 3.8 contain-
ing triples extracted from the respective Wikipedia
whose subject and object resource have an equiv-
alent English article.
4 Web Service Architecture Approach
The different language functionalities are imple-
mented following the service oriented architec-
ture (SOA) approach defined in the project XLike.
Therefore all the pipelines (one for each language)
have been implemented as web services and may
10

make computer and electronic products.
be requested to produce different levels of analy-
sis (e.g. tokenization, lemmatization, NERC, pars-
ing, relation extraction). This approach is very ap-
pealing due to the fact that it allows to treat ev-
ery language independently and execute the whole
language analysis process at different threads or
computers allowing an easier parallelization (e.g.
using external high perfomance platforms such as
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2
5
) as needed.
Furthermore it also provides independent develop-
ment lifecycles for each language which is crucial
in this type of research projects. Recall that these
web services can be deployed locally or remotely,
maintaining the option of using them in a stand-
alone configuration.
The main structure for each one of the pipelines
is described below:
• Spanish, English, and Catalan: all mod-
ules are based on FreeLing (Padr´o and
Stanilovsky, 2012) and Treeler.
• German: German shallow processing is
based on OpenNLP
6
, Stanford POS tagger
and NE extractor (Toutanova et al., 2003;
Finkel et al., 2005). Dependency parsing,
semantic role labeling, word sense disam-
biguation, and SRL-based frame extraction
are based on FreeLing and Treeler.
• Slovene: Slovene shallow processing is pro-
vided by JSI Enrycher
7
(
?
Stajner et al., 2010),
which consists of the Obeliks morphosyntac-
tic analysis library (Gr?car et al., 2012), the
LemmaGen lemmatizer (Jur?si?c et al., 2010)
and a CRF-based entity extractor (
?
Stajner et
al., 2012). Dependency parsing, word sense

disambiguation are based on FreeLing and
Treeler. Frame extraction is rule-based since
no SRL corpus is available for Slovene.
• Croatian: Croatian shallow processing is
based on proprietary tokenizer, POS/MSD-
tagging and lemmatisaton system (Agi´c et
al., 2008), NERC system (Bekavac and
Tadi´c, 2007) and dependency parser (Agi´c,
2012). Word sense disambiguation is based
on FreeLing. Frame extraction is rule-based
since no SRL corpus is available for Croatian.
• Chinese: Chinese shallow and deep process-
ing is based on a word segmentation compo-
nent ICTCLAS
8
and a semantic dependency
parser trained on CSDN corpus. Then, rule-
based frame extraction is performed (no SRL
corpus nor WordNet are available for Chi-
nese).
Each language analysis service is able to pro-
cess thousands of words per second when per-
forming shallow analysis (up to NE recognition),
and hundreds of words per second when produc-
ing the semantic representation based on full anal-
ysis. Moreover, the web service architecture en-
ables the same server to run a different thread for
each client, thus taking advantage of multiproces-
sor capabilities.
The components of the cross-lingual semantic
annotation stage are:
• xLiD-Lexica: The cross-lingual groundings
in xLiD-Lexica are translated into RDF data
and are accessible through a SPARQL end-
point, based on OpenLink Virtuoso
9
as the
back-end database engine.

11
• Semantic Annotation: The cross-lingual se-
mantic annotation service is based on the
xLiD-Lexica for entity mention recognition
and the JUNG Framework
10
for graph-based
disambiguation.
5 Conclusion
We presented the web service based architecture
used in XLike FP7 project to linguistically ana-
lyze large amounts of documents in seven differ-
ent languages. The analysis pipelines perform ba-
sic processing as tokenization, PoS-tagging, and
named entity extraction, as well as deeper analy-
sis such as dependency parsing, word sense disam-
biguation, and semantic role labelling. The result
of these linguistic analyzers is a semantic graph
capturing the main events described in the docu-
ment and their core participants.
On top of that, the cross-lingual semantic an-
notation component links the resulting linguistic
resources in one language to resources in a knowl-
edge bases in any other language or to language
independent representations. This semantic repre-
sentation is later used in XLike for document min-
ing purposes such as enabling cross-lingual ser-
vices for publishers, media monitoring or devel-
oping new business intelligence applications.
The described analysis services are currently
available via META-SHARE as callable RESTful
services.
