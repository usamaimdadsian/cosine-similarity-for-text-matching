Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a method for ex- 
tracting key paragraphs in articles based 
on the degree of context dependency. Like 
Luhn's technique, our method assumes 
that the words related to theme in an arti- 
cle appear throughout paragraphs. Our ex- 
traction technique of keywords is based on 
the degree of context dependency that how 
strongly a word is related to a given con- 
text. The results of experiments demon- 
strate the applicability of our proposed 
method. 
1 Introduction 
With increasing numbers of machine readable doc- 
uments becoming available, automatic document 
summarisation has become one of the major research 
topics in IR and NLP studies. 
In the field of an automatic summarisation, there 
are at least two approaches. One is knowledge-based 
approach with particular subject fields (Reimer, 
1988), (Jacobs, 1990). This approach, based on deep 
knowledge of particular subject fields, is useful for 
restricted tasks, such as, for example, the construc- 
tion of 'weather forecasts' summaries. However, 
when unrestricted subject matter must be treated, 
as is often the case in practice, the passage retrieval 
and text summarisation methods proposed have not 
proven equal to the need, since deep knowledge of 
particular subject fields is required (Paice, 1990), 
(Zechner, 1996). 
The other, alternative strategy is the approach 
that relies mainly on corpus statistics (Paice, 1990), 
(Palce, 1993). The main task of this approach is 
the sentence scoring process. Typically, weights 
are assigned to the individual words in a text, and 
the complete sentence scores are then based on the 
occurrence characteristics of highly-weighted terms 
(keywords) in the respective sentences. 
Term weighting technique has been widely inves- 
tigated in information retrieval and lots of tech- 
niques such as location heuristics (Baxendale, 1958), 
rhetorical relations (Miike, 1994), and title informa- 
tion (Edmundson, 1969) have been proposed. These 
techniques seem to be less dependent on the domain. 
However, Salton claims that it is difficult to pro- 
duce high accuracy of retrieval by using these term- 
weighting approaches (Salton, 1993). 
The other term weighting technique is based on 
keyword frequency (Luhn, 1958). Keyword fre- 
quency is further less dependent on the domain than 
other weighting methods and therefore, well studied. 
Major approaches which are based on keyword fre- 
quency assume on the fact that the keywords of the 
article appear frequently in the article, but appear 
seldom in other articles (Luhn, 1958), (Nagao, 1976), 
(Salton, 1993), (Zechner, 1996). These approaches 
seem to show the effect in entirely different articles, 
such as 'weather forecasts', 'medical reports', and 
'computer manuals'. Because each different article 
is characterised by a larger number of words which 
appear frequently in one article, but appear seldom 
in other articles. However, in some articles from 
the same domain such as 'weather forecasts', one 
encounters quite a number of words which appear 
frequently over articles. Therefore, how to extract 
keyword from these words is a serious problem in 
such the restricted subject domain. 
In this paper, we propose a method for extract- 
ing key paragraphs in articles based on the degree of 
context dependency and show how the idea of con- 
text dependency can be used effectively to extract 
key paragraphs than other related work. 
The basic idea of our approach is that whether a 
word is a key in an article or not depends on the do- 
main to which the article belongs. Let 'stake' be a 
keyword and 'today' not be a keyword in the article. 
If the article belongs to a restricted subject domain, 
such as 'Stock market', there are other articles which 
are related to the article. Therefore, the frequency of 
'stake' and 'today' in other articles are similar with 
each other. Let us consider further a broad coverage 
domain such as newspaper articles; i.e. the article 
containing the words 'stake' and 'today' belongs to 
a newspaper which consists of different subject do- 
mains such as 'Stock market' news, 'International' 
291 
news, 'Weather forecasts' news. 'Today' should ap- 
pear frequently with every article even in such a do- 
main; i.e. newspaper articles, while 'stake' should 
not. Our technique for extraction of keywords ex- 
plicitly exploits this feature of context dependency 
of word: how strongly a word is related to a given 
context. 
In the following sections, we first explain con- 
text dependency using newspaper articles, then we 
present our term weighting method and a method 
for extracting key paragraphs. Finally, we report 
some experiments o show the effect of our method. 
2 Context  Dependency  
Like Luhn's assumption about keywords, our 
method is based on the fact that a writer normally 
repeats certain words (keywords) as he advances or 
varies his arguments and as he elaborates on an as- 
pect of a subject (Luhn, 1958). In this paper, we 
focus on newspaper articles. Figure 1 shows the 
structure of Wall Street Journal corpus.

Figure 1: The structure of newspaper articles 
In Figure 1, one day's newspaper articles consist of 
several different topics such as 'Economic news', 'In- 
ternational news', etc. We call this Domain, and each 
element ('Economic news', or 'International news') 
a context. A particular domain, for example, 'Eco- 
nomic news', consists of several articles each of which 
has different itle name. In Figure 1, 'General sig- 
nal corp.', 'Safecard services inc.', and 'Jostens inc.' 
show title names. We call this Article, and each 
element ('General signal corp.' etc) context. Fur- 
thermore, a particular article, for example, 'General 
signal corp.' consists of several paragraphs and key- 
words of the 'General signal corp.' article appear 
throughout paragraphs. We call each paragraph 
context in the Paragraph .  
We introduce a degree of context dependency into 
the structure of newspaper articles shown in Figure 
1 in order to extract keywords. A degree of context 
dependency is a measure showing how strongly each 
word related to a given context, a particular con- 
text of Paragraph, Article, or Domain .  In Figure 1, 
let 'O '  be a keyword in the article 'General signal 
corp.'. According to Luhn's assumption, 'O'  fre- 
quently appears throughout paragraphs. Therefore, 
the deviation value of 'O '  in the Paragraph is small. 
On the other hand, the deviation value of 'O '  in the 
Article is larger than that of the Paragraph, since in 
Article, 'O '  appears in a particular element of the 
Article, 'General signal corp.'. Furthermore, the de- 
viation value of 'O '  in the Domain is larger than 
those of the Article and Paragraph, since in the Do- 
main, 'O '  appears frequently in a particular context, 
'Economic news'. We extracted keywords using this 
feature of the degree of context dependency. In Fig- 
ure 1, if a word is a keyword in a given article, it 
satisfies the following two conditions: 
1. The deviation value of a word in the Paragraph 
is smaller than that of the Article. 
2. The deviation value of a word in the Article is 
smaller than that of the Domain. 
3 Term Weight ing  
Every sense of words in articles for extracting key 
paragraphs is automatically disambiguated in ad- 
vance. This is because to disambiguate word-senses 
in articles might affect the accuracy of context de- 
pendent (domain specific) key paragraphs retrieval, 
since the meaning of a word characterises the do- 
main in which it is used. Word-sense disambigua- 
tion (WSD in short) is a serious problem for NLP, 
and a variety of approaches have been proposed for 
solving it (Brown, 1991), (Yarowsky, 1992). Our 
disambignation method is based on Niwa's method 
which uses the similarity between a sentence contain- 
ing a polysemous noun and a sentence of dictionary- 
definition (Niwa, 1994). Furthermore, we linked 
nouns which are disambignated with their seman- 
tically similar nouns mainly in order to cope with 
the problem of a phrasal exicon. A phrasal exicon 
such as Atlantic Seaboard, New England gives a neg- 
ative influence for keywords retrieval, since it can 
not be regarded as units, i.e. each word which is 
the element of a phrasal exicon is assigned to each 
semantic ode (Fukumoto, 1996). 
To the results of WSD and linking methods, 
we then applied a term weighting method to ex- 
tract keywords. There have been several term 
weighting based on word frequencies, such as 
TF(Term Frequency), IDF(Inverse Document Fre- 
quency), TF*IDF, WIDF(Weighted Inverse Doc- 
ument Frequency) (Luhn, 1957), (Sparck, 1973), 
(Salton, 1983), (Tokunaga, 1994). We used Watan- 
292  
abe's X2 method for term weighting which is shown 
in formula (1) (Watanabe, 1996). 
2 / (='i-ra*J)= if ziy > mii = m,~ (i) 
Xij 0 otherwise 
Formula (1) shows the value of X 2 of the word i in 
the domain j. zij in (1) is the frequency of word i 
in the domain j. mij in (1) is shown in formula (2). 
E~=I O~ij k (2) mi j  = k 1 
~i=l~j=a=i~ i=1 
In formula (2), k is the number of different words 
and l is the number of the domains. A larger value 
of X~ means that the word i appears more frequently 
in thJe domain j than in the other. 
4 An  Ext rac t ion  of  Keywords 
The first step to extract keywords is to calculate 
X 2 for each word in the Paragraph, the Article, and 
the Domain. We used formula (1) to calculate the 
value of xP~j, xAi2j, and xD~y, where xP~i, xAi~, and 
xD~; indicate which word i appears most frequently 
in t~e context j of Paragraph, Article, and Domain, 
respectively. For example, xPi2j is shown in formula 
(3) by using formula (1). 
xP,:~. = ( z i j -mo)2  (3) 
mi j  
In formula (3), xlj is the frequency of word i in the 
context j of Paragraph. miy in formula (3) is shown 
in (2) where k is the number of different words and 
l is the number of contexts in Paragraph. 
The second step is to calculate the degree of word 
/ in  Paragraph (xP~), Article (xA~), and Domain 
(xD~). We defined the degree of word i in Paragraph, 
Article, and Domain as the deviation value of k con- 
texts in Paragraph, Article, and Domain, respectively. 
Here, k is the number of contexts in Paragraph, Ar- 
ticle, and Domain, respectively. For example, the 
deviation value of the word i in Paragraph is defined 
as follows: 
xP~ = Z\]i:1(_;- mi) (4) 
In formula (4), k is the number of contexts in Para- 
graph, and mi is the mean value of the total fre- 
quency of word i in Paragraph which consists of k 
contexts. 
The last step to extract keywords is to calculate 
the context dependency ofword i using formula (4). 
We recall that if i satisfies both 1 and 2 in section 
2, the word i is regarded as a keyword. 
xP~ 
:)cA~ < 1 (5) 
xA~ 
xD ~ < 1 (6) 
Formulae (5) and (6) shows i, and 2 in section 2, 
respectively. In formulae (5) and (6), xP~, xA~, and 
xD~ are the deviation value of a set of Paragraph, 
Article, and Domain, respectively. 
5 An  Ext rac t ion  of  Key Paragraphs 
The procedure for extracting key paragraphs has the 
following three stages: 
Stage One: Representing every paragraph as a vector 
The goal of this stage is to represent every para- 
graph in an article as a vector. Using a term weight- 
mg method, every paragraph in an article would be 
represented by vector of the form 
m, = (7) 
where n is the number of nouns in an article and Niy 
is as follows; {o 
1(Nj) 
Nis= 0 
where I(Nj) is a frequency with which the noun Nj 
appears in paragraph Pi. 
Stage Two: Clustering method 
Given a vector representation f paragraphs P1, 
• .., P,~ as in formula (7), a similarity between two 
paragraphs Pi, Pj in an article would be obtained 
by using formula (8). The similarity of Pi and Pj is 
measured by the inner product of their normalised 
vectors and is defined as follows: 
Nj does not appear in Pi 
Nj is a keyword and appears in Pi 
Nj is not a keyword and appears 
in P~ 
v(P,), v(Pj) (8) 
Sim(P,,Pj) = IV(P,)II v(nj) l 
The greater the value of Sim(Pi, Pi) is, the more 
similar these two paragraphs are. For a set of para- 
graphs P1, "" ", Pm of an article, we calculate the 
semantic similarity value of all possible pairs of para- 
graphs. The clustering algorithm is applied to the 
sets and produces a set of semantic lusters, which 
are ordered in the descending order of their seman- 
tic similarity values. We adopted non-overlapping, 
group average method in our clustering technique 
(Jardine, 1968). 
Stage Three: Extraction of key paragraphs 
The sample results of clustering is shown in Table 
1. 
293 
Table 1: The sample results of clustering

'Num' in Table 1 shows the order of clusters which 
we have obtained and the number shown under 
'Cluster' shows the paragraph numbers. In Table 
1, if the number of keywords which belonging to the 
third paragraph is larger than that of the fourth, 
the order of key paragraphs i 3 ) 4 > 1 ~ 2, 
otherwise, 4 > 3 ~ 1 ) 2. 
6 Exper iments  
We have conducted three experiments to examine 
the effect of our method. The first experiment, Key- 
words Experiment, is concerned with the keywords 
extracting technique and with verifying the effect of 
our method which introduces context dependency. 
The second experiment, Key Paragraphs Experiment, 
shows how the extracted keywords can be used to 
extract key paragraphs. In the third experiment, 
Comparison to Other Related Work, we applied Zech- 
ner's key sentences method (Zechner, 1996) to key 
paragraphs extraction (we call this method_A), and 
compared it with our method. 
6.1 Data 
The corpus we have used is the 1988, 1989 Wall 
Street J~urnal (Liherman, 1991) in ACL/DCI CD- 
ROM which consists of about 280,000 part-of-speech 
tagged sentences (BriU, 1992). Wall Street Journal 
consists of many articles, and each article has a ti- 
tle name. These titles are classified into 76 different 
domains. We selected 10 different domains and used 
them as Domain. As a test data, we selected 50 
articles each of which belongs to one of these 10 do- 
mains. The selected omain names and the number 
of articles are shown in Table 2. 
Table 2: The selected ata

PCS: stones, gold 9 CMD: farm products 3 
There are 3,802 different nouns in 50 articles. As a 
result of WSD and linking methods for these articles, 
we have obtained 3,707 different nouns. 
6.2 Keywords Experiment 
Formulae (5) and (6) are applied to 50 articles which 
are the results of WSD and linking methods, and as a 
result, we have obtained 1,047 keywords in all. The 
result of keyword extraction is shown in Table 3.

In Table 3, z in 'z(y)'  of 'Paragraph' shows the num- 
ber of paragraphs in an article, 'y' shows the number 
of articles. For example, 3(1) shows that there is one 
article which consists of three paragraphs. Recall 
and Precision in Table 3 are as follows; 
Number of correct keywords Recall = Number of keywords which are se- 
lected by human 
Number of correct keywords 
Precision = Number of keywords which are se- 
lected in our method 
Recall and Precision in Table 3 show the means in 
each paragraph. The denominator of Recall is made 
by three human judges; i.e. when more than one 
human judged the word as a keyword, the word is 
regarded as a keyword. 
6.3 Key Paragraphs Experiment 
For each article, we extracted 10 ,~50 % of its para- 
graphs as key paragraphs. The results of key para- 
graphs experiment are shown in Table 4. 
In Table 4, 10 ,~ 50 % indicates the extraction ratio 
used. 'Para.' shows the number of paragraphs which 
humans judged to be key paragraphs, and 'Correct' 
shows the number of these paragraphs which the 
method obtained correctly. Evaluation is performed 
by three human judges. When more than one hu- 
man judges a paragraph as a key paragraph, the 
paragraph is regarded as a key paragraph. '*' in Ta- 
ble 4 shows that the number of the correct data is 
smaller than that of an extraction ratio. For exam- 
ple, in Table 4, the number of paragraphs of 20 % 
out of 22 is 4. However, the number of paragraphs 
that more than one human judged the paragraph

6.4 Compar i son  to  Other  Re la ted  Work  
Zechner proposed a method to extract  key sentences 
in an art ic le by using simple stat ist ica l  method;  i.e. 
TF* IDF  te rm weighting method.  In order to show 
the appl icabi l i ty  of our method,  we appl ied Zech- 
ner's key sentences method to key paragraphs  ex- 
t ract ion and compared it with our method.  In Zech- 
ner's method,  the sum over all TF* IDF  values of the 
content words for each sentence are calculated, and 
the sentences are sorted according to their  weights. 
F inal ly  a part icu lar  number of sentences are ex- 
t racted as key sentences. The data  we used con- 
sists of 1.92 sentences par  a paragraph and was not 
so many sentences within a paragraph.  Then,  in 
order to apply  his method to key paragraphs  ex- 
t ract ion,  we calculated the sum over all sentences 
for each paragraph,  and sorted the paragraphs  ac- 
cording to their  weights. From these, we extracted 
a certain number of paragraphs  (method_A). In our 
method,  every sense of words in art icles for extract-  
ing key paragraphs  i d isambiguated in advance and 
l inking method is performed. In order to examine 
where the performance comes from, we also com- 
pared our method to the method which WSD and 
l inking method are not applied. The result is shown 
in Table 5. 
In Table 5, '%' shows the extract ion rat io,  10 ,-~ 50%

7.1 Keywords  Exper iment  
E f fec t iveness  o f  the  Method  
According to Table 3, Recall and Precision values 
range from 46.5/50.2 to 100.0/89.4, the mean being 
78.7/78.6. This shows that  our method is effective 
even in a restr icted omain such as f inancial articles, 
e.g. Wall Street Journal, although the test set was 
small  (50 articles). Furthermore,  the correct rat io 
does not depend on the number  of paragraphs  in 
an article. This shows that  our context dependency 
model  is appl icable for different size of the samples. 
Prob lem o f  the  Method  
According to Table 3, the worst results of Recall 
and Precision was (46.5/50.2) when the number of 
295 
paragraphs was 14. As a result, the result of the 
extraction of key paragraphs shown in Table 4 was 
also worst (56.5%). The possible causes of the error 
were summarised the following two points:

In Table 6, each value of 'Paragraph', Article', and 
'Domain', shows each X 2 value. 'Total average' shows 
the mean of all keywords. 'word237' and 'word238' 
are representative words which are the result of link- 
ing noun with their semantically similar nouns. Ac- 
cording to Table 6, we can observe that in 'Para- 
graph', for example, some words whose X 2 values 
are slightly higher than the average (1,772) exist. 
For example, the X 2 value of 'word237' is 4.633 and 
slightly higher than 1.772. However, 'word237' satis- 
fies the formulae of context dependency. As a result, 
'word237' is regarded as a keyword, while this is not. 
When the extracted ratio was 10%, there were four 
articles whose correct ratio did not attained 100%. 
Of these, three articles are classified into this type 
of the error. 
From the above observation, we can estimate that 
the formulae of context dependency are weak con- 
straints in some domains, while they are still effec- 
tive even in a restricted domain. In order to get 
more accuracy, some other constraints uch as loca- 
tion heuristics (Baxendale, 1958) or upper-case word 
feature (Kupiec, 1995) might be necessary to be in- 
troduced into our framework. 
(2) The error of WSD 
When the extracted ratio was 10%, there was one 
article out of four articles which could not be ex- 
tracted correctly because of the error of WSD. The 
test article and the results of it was shown in Figure 
, 
In Figure 2, the headline shows the title name. The 
numbers show the paragraph number, and the un- 
derlined words are keywords which are extracted in 
our method. The bottom shows the result of key 
paragraphs extraction. According to Figure 2, when 
the extraction ratio was 50%, the paragraphs 3 and 
4 were extracted and the paragraph 1 was not ex- 
tracted, although it is a key paragraph. The key- 
words and their frequencies of appearance in para- 
graph 1, 3, and 4 are shown in Table 7.

According to Table 7, 'crystal' and 'oil in paragraph 
1 are disambiguated incorrectly and were replaced 
by 'crystal4' and 'oi14', respectively, while 'crystal '  
should have been replaced by 'crystal2' and 'oi1' with 
'oi13'. Therefore, the number of words which appear 
in both paragraph 3 and 4 was larger than any other 
pair of paragraphs. As a result, paragraph 3 and 4 
are the most semantically similar paragraphs and 1 
was not extracted as a key paragraph. 
In our method, the correct ratio of key paragraphs 
extraction strongly depends on the results of WSD. 
The correct ratio of our WSD was 78.4% (Fukumoto, 
1996). In order to get higher accuracy, it is necessary 
to improve our WSD method. 
7.2 Key  Paragraphs  Exper iment  
E f fec t iveness  o f  the  Method 
In Key Paragraphs Experiment, the overall results 
were positive, especially when the ratio of extrac- 
tion was 10,,,30%. The ratios of correct judgements 
in these cases were significantly high; i.e. 92.5%, 
91.3%, and 89.2%, respectively. This demonstrates 
the applicability of the degree of context depen- 
dency. 
L imi ta t ions  o f  the  Method 
When the ratio of extraction was higher than 30%, 
the results was 72.7% and 60.4%. Furthermore, the 
more paragraphs are in an article, the smaller the 
number of correct judgements. One possible cause 
of these results is that the clustering method might 
have a negative ffect on extracting key paragraphs.

The results of Key Paragraph Extraction: 3 ---+ 4 --+ 1 ---+ 2 
Figure 2: The sample of the article 
In the field of text summarisation, a vector model 
was often used for extracting key sentence or key 
paragraph (Tokunaga, 1994), (Zechner, 1996). In 
this model, the sentences with term weighting are 
sorted according to their weights and this informa- 
tion is used to extract a certain ratio of highest 
weighted paragraph in an article. We implemented 
this model and compared it with our clustering tech- 
nique. The results are shown in Table 8. 
Table 8: Our method and a vector model 
% Path. Our method(%) Vector model(%) 
10 54 50(92.5) 48(88.9) 
20 69 63(91.3) 58(84.1) 
30 84 75(89.3) 68(78.6) 
40 132 96(72.7) 91(69.0) 
50 215 130(60.4) 128(60.6) 
In Table 8, '%' shows the extraction ratio, 10 ~ 50% 
and 'Para. '  shows the mfmber of total paragraphs 
corresponding to each '%'. 'Our method',  and 'Vec- 
tor model' shows the results of our method, and us- 
ing vector model, respectively. 
Table 8 shows that the results using our method 
are highly than those of using the vector model. In 
our method, when the extraction ratio was more 
than 30%, the correct ratio decreased. This phe- 
nomena is also observed in the vector model. From 
the observation, we can estimate that the cause of 
the results was not our clustering technique. Exam- 
ining the results of human judges, when the number 
of paragraphs was more than 14, the number of para- 
graphs marked with a '*' is large. This shows that 
it is too difficult even for a human to judge whether 
a paragraph is a key paragraph or not. From the 
observation, for these articles, there are limitations 
to our method based on context dependency. 
Other  Heur ist ics  
As we discussed in Keywords Experiment, it might 
be considered that some heuristics uch as location 
of paragraphs are introduced into our method to get 
a higher accuracy of keywords and key paragraphs 
extraction, even in these articles. Table 9 shows 
the location of key paragraphs extracted using our 
method and extracted by humans. The extraction 
ratio described in Table 9 is 30%. 
Table 9: The location of key paragraphs 
Articles 
Hum. Method 
(a)First 39 37 
(b)First and Last 4 4 
(c)First, Mid-position, and Last 1 1 
(d)First and Mid-position 4 4 
(e)Mid-position 0 1 
(f) Otherwise 2 3 
Total 50 50 
In Table 9, each paragraph (First, Mid-position, and 
Last paragraph) includes the paragraphs around it. 
According to Table 9, in human judgement, 39 out 
of 50 articles' key paragraphs are located in the first 
parts, and the ratio attained 78.0%. This shows 
that using only location heuristics (the key para- 
graph tends to be located in the first parts) is a weak 
constraint in itself, since the results of our method 
showed that the correct ratio attained 89.2%. How- 
ever, in our method, 2 articles are not extracted cor- 
rectly, while the key paragraph is located in the first 
parts of these articles. From the observation, in a 
corpus such as Wall Street Journal, utilising a lo- 
cation heuristics is useful for extracting key para- 
graphs. 
7.3 Compar i son  to Other  Re la ted  Work  
According to Table 5, the average ratio of our 
method and method_A was 74.7%, and 48.6%, re- 
spectively. This shows that method_A is not more 
effective than our method. This is because most of 
nouns do not contribute to showing the characteris- 
tic of each domain for given articles. In the test data 
which consists of 3,802 different nouns, 2,171 nouns 
appeared in only one article and the frequency of 
each of them is one. We recall that in method_A, 
297 
when word i appears in only one article and the fre- 
quency of i is one, the value of TF*IDF equals to 
log50. There are 2,955 out of 3,802 nouns whose 
TF*IDF value is less than log50, and the percentage 
attained at 77.7%. This causes the fact that most of 
nouns do not contribute to showing the characteris- 
tic of each domain for given articles. 
Comparing the difference ratio of 'Our method' 
and 'not WSD' to that of 'not WSD' and method_A, 
the former was 10.5% and the latter was 15.6%. 
Therefore, our context dependency model con- 
tributes the extraction of key paragraphs, although 
WSD and linking are still effective. 
8 Conclusion 
We have reported an experimental study for extract- 
ing key paragraphs based on the degree of context 
dependency for a given article and showed how our 
context dependency model can use effectively to ex- 
tract key paragraphs, each of which belongs to the 
restricted subject domain. In order to cope with 
the remaining problems mentioned in section 7 and 
apply this work to practical use, we will conduct 
further experiments.
