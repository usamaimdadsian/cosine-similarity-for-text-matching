Abstract
We propose online unsupervised domain
adaptation (DA), which is performed in-
crementally as data comes in and is appli-
cable when batch DA is not possible. In
a part-of-speech (POS) tagging evaluation,
we find that online unsupervised DA per-
forms as well as batch DA.
1 Introduction
Unsupervised domain adaptation is a scenario that
practitioners often face when having to build ro-
bust NLP systems. They have labeled data in the
source domain, but wish to improve performance
in the target domain by making use of unlabeled
data alone. Most work on unsupervised domain
adaptation in NLP uses batch learning: It assumes
that a large corpus of unlabeled data of the tar-
get domain is available before testing. However,
batch learning is not possible in many real-world
scenarios where incoming data from a new target
domain must be processed immediately. More im-
portantly, in many real-world scenarios the data
does not come with neat domain labels and it may
not be immediately obvious that an input stream is
suddenly delivering data from a new domain.
Consider an NLP system that analyzes emails
at an enterprise. There is a constant stream of in-
coming emails and it changes over time – without
any clear indication that the models in use should
be adapted to the new data distribution. Because
the system needs to work in real-time, it is also de-
sirable to do any adaptation of the system online,
without the need of stopping the system, changing
it and restarting it as is done in batch mode.
In this paper, we propose online unsupervised
domain adaptation as an extension to traditional
unsupervised DA. In online unsupervised DA, do-
main adaptation is performed incrementally as
data comes in. Specifically, we adopt a form of
representation learning. In our experiments, the
incremental updating will be performed for repre-
sentations of words. Each time a word is encoun-
tered in the stream of data at test time, its repre-
sentation is updated.
To the best of our knowledge, the work re-
ported here is the first study of online unsuper-
vised DA. More specifically, we evaluate online
unsupervised DA for the task of POS tagging. We
compare POS tagging results for three distinct ap-
proaches: static (the baseline), batch learning and
online unsupervised DA. Our results show that
online unsupervised DA is comparable in perfor-
mance to batch learning while requiring no retrain-
ing or prior data in the target domain.
2 Experimental setup
Tagger. We reimplemented the FLORS tagger
(Schnabel and Sch¨utze, 2014), a fast and simple
tagger that performs well in DA. It treats POS tag-
ging as a window-based (as opposed to sequence
classification), multilabel classification problem.
FLORS is ideally suited for online unsupervised
DA because its representation of words includes
distributional vectors – these vectors can be easily
updated in both batch learning and online unsu-
pervised DA. More specifically, a word’s represen-
tation in FLORS consists of four feature vectors:
one each for its suffix, its shape and its left and
right distributional neighbors. Suffix and shape
features are standard features used in the litera-
ture; our use of them is exactly as described by
Schnabel and Sch¨utze (2014).
Distributional features. The i
th
entry x
i
of the
left distributional vector of w is the weighted num-
ber of times the indicator word c
i
occurs immedi-
ately to the left of w:
x
i
= tf (freq (bigram(c
i
, w)))
where c
i
is the word with frequency rank i in the
corpus, freq (bigram(c
i
, w)) is the number of oc-
currences of the bigram “c
i
w” and we weight non-

zero frequencies logarithmically: tf(x) = 1 +
log(x). The right distributional vector is defined
analogously. We restrict the set of indicator words
to the n = 500 most frequent words. To avoid
zero vectors, we add an entry x
n+1
to each vector
that counts omitted contexts:
x
501
= tf(
?
j:j>n
freq (bigram(c
j
, w)))
Let f(w) be the concatentation of the two dis-
tributional and suffix and shape vectors of word w.
Then FLORS represents token v
i
as follows:
f(v
i?2
)?f(v
i?1
)?f(v
i
)?f(v
i+1
)?f(v
i+2
)
where ? is vector concatenation. FLORS then
tags token v
i
based on this representation.
FLORS assumes that the association between
distributional features and labels does not change
fundamentally when going from source to target.
This is in contrast to other work, notably Blitzer
et al. (2006), that carefully selects “stable” dis-
tributional features and discards “unstable” dis-
tributional features. The hypothesis underlying
FLORS is that basic distributional POS properties
are relatively stable across domains – in contrast to
semantic and other more complex tasks. The high
performance of FLORS (Schnabel and Sch¨utze,
2014) suggests this hypothesis is true.
Data. Test set. We evaluate on the development
sets of six different TDs: five SANCL (Petrov
and McDonald, 2012) domains – newsgroups, we-
blogs, reviews, answers, emails – and sections 22-
23 of WSJ for in-domain testing.
We use two training sets of different sizes. In
condition l:big (big labeled data set), we train
FLORS on sections 2-21 of Wall Street Journal
(WSJ). Condition l:small uses 10% of l:big.
Data for word representations. We also vary the
size of the datasets that are used to compute the
word representations before the FLORS model is
trained on the training set. In condition u:big, we
compute distributional vectors on the joint corpus
of all labeled and unlabeled text of source and tar-
get domains (except for the test sets). We also
include 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988 and
500,000 sentences from Gigaword (Parker, 2009).
In condition u:0, only labeled training data is used.
Methods. We implemented the following mod-
ification compared to the setup in (Schnabel and
Sch¨utze, 2014): distributional vectors are kept in
memory as count vectors. This allows us to in-
crease the counts during online tagging.
We run experiments with three versions of
FLORS: STATIC, BATCH and ONLINE. All three
methods compute word representations on “data
for word representations” (described above) be-
fore the model is trained on one of the two “train-
ing sets” (described above).
STATIC. Word representations are not changed
during testing.
BATCH. Before testing, we update
count vectors by freq (bigram(c
i
, w)) +=
freq
?
(bigram(c
i
, w)), where freq
?
(·) denotes the
number of occurrences of the bigram “c
i
w” in the
entire test set.
ONLINE. Before tagging a test sentence, both
left and right distributional vectors are updated via
freq (bigram(c
i
, w)) += 1 for each appearance of
bigram “c
i
w” in the sentence. Then the sentence
is tagged using the updated word representations.
As tagging progresses, the distributional represen-
tations become increasingly specific to the target
domain (TD), converging to the representations
that BATCH uses at the end of the tagging process.
In all three modes, suffix and shape features are
always fully specified, for both known and un-
known words.

ing lines “S&S” and “S&S (reimpl.)” in the ta-
ble, we see that our reimplementation of FLORS
is comparable to S&S’s. For the rest of this pa-
per, our setup for BATCH and ONLINE differs from
S&S’s in three respects. (i) We use Gigaword as
additional unlabeled data. (ii) When we train a
FLORS model, then the corpora that the word rep-
resentations are derived from do not include the
test set. The set of corpora used by S&S for this
purpose includes the test set. We make this change
because application data may not be available at
training time in DA. (iii) The word representations
used when the FLORS model is trained are derived
from all six SANCL domains. This simplifies the
experimental setup as we only need to train a sin-
gle model, not one per domain. Table 1 shows that
our setup with these three changes (lines BATCH
and ONLINE) has state-of-the-art performance on
SANCL for domain adaptation (bold numbers).
Table 2 investigates the effect of sizes of labeled
and unlabeled data on performance of ONLINE
and BATCH. We report accuracy for all (ALL) to-
kens, for tokens occurring in both l:big and l:small
(KN), tokens occurring in neither l:big nor l:small
(OOV) and tokens ocurring in l:big, but not in
l:small (SHFT).

Except for some minor variations
in a few cases, both using more labeled data and
using more unlabeled data improves tagging accu-
racy for both ONLINE and BATCH. ONLINE and
BATCH are generally better or as good as STATIC
(in bold), always on ALL and OOV, and with a few
exceptions also on KN and SHFT.
ONLINE performance is comparable to BATCH
performance: it is slightly worse than BATCH on
u:0 (largest ALL difference is .29) and at most .02
different from BATCH for ALL on u:big. We ex-

plain below why ONLINE is sometimes (slightly)
better than BATCH, e.g., for ALL and condition
l:small/u:big.
3.1 Time course of tagging accuracy
The ONLINE model introduced in this paper has
a property that is unique compared to most other
work in statistical NLP: its predictions change as
it tags text because its representations change.
To study this time course of changes, we need
a large application domain because subtle changes
will be too variable in the small test sets of the
SANCL TDs. The only labeled domain that is big
enough is the WSJ corpus. We therefore reverse
the standard setup and train the model on the dev
sets of the five SANCL domains (l:big) or on the
first 5000 labeled words of reviews (l:small). In
this reversed setup, u:big uses the five unlabeled
SANCL data sets and Gigaword as before. Since
variance of performance is important, we run on
100 randomly selected 50% samples of WSJ and
report average and standard deviation of tagging
error over these 100 trials.
The results in Table 3
2
show that error rates are
only slightly worse for ONLINE than for BATCH
or the same. In fact, l:small/u:0 known error rate
(.1186) is lower for ONLINE than for BATCH (sim-
ilar to what we observed in Table 2). This will be
discussed at the end of this section.
Table 3 includes results for “unseens” as well as
unknowns because Schnabel and Sch¨utze (2014)
show that unseens cause at least as many errors
as unknowns. We define unseens as words with
a tag that did not occur in training; we compute
unseen error rates on all occurrences of unseens,
i.e., occurrences with both seen and unseen tags
are included. As Table 3 shows, the error rate for
unknowns is greater than for unseens which is in
turn greater than the error rate on known words.
2
Significance test: test of equal proportion, p < .05
Examining the single conditions, we can see
that ONLINE fares better than STATIC in 10 out of
12 cases and only slightly worse for l:small/u:big
(unseens, known words: .1086 vs .1084, .0802 vs
.0801). In four conditions it is significantly better
with improvements ranging from .005 (.1404 vs
.1451: l:big/u:0, unknown words) to >.06 (.3094
vs .3670: l:small/u:0, unknown words).
The differences between ONLINE and STATIC
in the other eight conditions are negligible. For
the six u:big conditions, this is not surprising: the
Gigaword corpus consists of news, so the large un-
labeled data set is in reality the same domain as
WSJ. Thus, if large unlabeled data sets are avail-
able that are similar to the TD, then one might as
well use STATIC tagging since the extra work re-
quired for ONLINE/BATCH is unlikely to pay off.
Using more labeled data (comparing l:small and
l:big) always considerably decreases error rates.
We did not test for significance here because the
differences are so large. By the same token, us-
ing more unlabeled data (comparing u:0 and u:big)
also consistently decreases error rates. The differ-
ences are large and significant for ONLINE tagging
in all six cases (indicated by ? in the table).
There is no large difference in variability ON-
LINE vs. BATCH (see columns “std”). Thus, given
that it has equal variability and higher perfor-
mance, ONLINE is preferable to BATCH since it
assumes no dataset available prior to the start of
tagging.
Figure 1 shows the time course of tagging ac-
curacy.
3
BATCH and STATIC have constant error
rates since they do not change representations dur-
ing tagging. ONLINE error decreases for unknown
words – approaching the error rate of BATCH – as
3
In response to a reviewer question, the initial (leftmost)
errors of ONLINE and STATIC are not identical; e.g., ONLINE
has a better chance of correctly tagging the very first occur-
rence of an unknown word because that very first occurrence

Figure 1: Error rates for unknown words, words with unseen
tags and known words for l:small/u:0. The x axis represents
the number of tokens of the respective type (e.g., number of
tokens of unknown words).
more and more is learned with each additional oc-
currence of an unknown word (top).
Interestingly, the error of ONLINE increases for
unseens and known words (middle&bottom pan-
els) (even though it is always below the error rate
of BATCH). The reason is that the BATCH update
swamps the original training data for l:small/u:0
because the WSJ test set is bigger by a large fac-
tor than the training set. ONLINE fares better here
because in the beginning of tagging the updates of
the distributional representations consist of small
increments. We noticed this in Table 2 too: there,
ONLINE outperformed BATCH in some cases on
KN for l:small/u:big. In future work, we plan
to investigate how to weight distributional counts
from the target data relative to that from the (la-
beled und unlabeled) source data.
4 Related work
Online learning usually refers to supervised learn-
ing algorithms that update the model each time
after processing a few training examples. Many
supervised learning algorithms are online or have
online versions. Active learning (Lewis and Gale,
1994; Tong and Koller, 2001; Laws et al., 2011) is
another supervised learning framework that pro-
cesses training examples – usually obtained inter-
actively – in small batches (Bordes et al., 2005).
All of this work on supervised online learning
is not directly relevant to this paper since we ad-
dress the problem of unsupervised DA. Unlike on-
line supervised learners, we keep the statistical
model unchanged during DA and adopt a repre-
sentation learning approach: each unlabeled con-
text of a word is used to update its representation.
There is much work on unsupervised DA for
POS tagging, including work using constraint-
based methods (Subramanya et al., 2010; Rush et
al., 2012), instance weighting (Choi and Palmer,
2012), self-training (Huang et al., 2009; Huang
and Yates, 2010), and co-training (K¨ubler and
Baucom, 2011). All of this work uses batch learn-
ing. For space reasons, we do not discuss super-
vised DA (e.g., Daum´e III and Marcu (2006)).
5 Conclusion
We introduced online updating of word represen-
tations, a new domain adaptation method for cases
where target domain data are read from a stream
and BATCH processing is not possible. We showed
that online unsupervised DA performs as well as
batch learning. It also significantly lowers error
rates compared to STATIC (i.e., no domain adapta-
tion). Our implementation of FLORS is available
at cistern.cis.lmu.de/flors
