Abstract
We describe a state-of-the-art automatic
system that can acquire subcategorisation
frames from raw text for a free word-order
language. We use it to construct a subcate-
gorisation lexicon of German verbs from a
large Web page corpus. With an automatic
verb classification paradigm we evaluate
our subcategorisation lexicon against a pre-
vious classification of German verbs; the
lexicon produced by our system performs
better than the best previous results.
1 Introduction
We introduce a state-of-the-art system for the ac-
quisition of subcategorisation frames (SCFs) from
large corpora, which can deal with languages with
very free word order. The concrete language we
treat is German; its word order variability is illus-
trated in (1)–(4), all of which express the sentence
The man gave the old dog a chop:
(1) Dem alten Hund gab der Mann ein Schnitzel.
(2) Ein Schnitzel gab dem alten Hund der Mann.
(3) Ein Schnitzel gab der Mann dem alten Hund.
(4) Der Mann gab dem alten Hund ein Schnitzel.
On the basis of raw text, the system can be
used to build extensive SCF lexicons for German
verbs. Subcategorisation means that lexical items
require specific obligatory concomitants or argu-
ments; we focus on verb subcategorisation. E.g.,
the verb geben ‘give’ requires three arguments, the
nominative subject der Mann ‘the man’, the dative
indirect object dem alten Hund ‘the old dog’, and
the accusative direct object ein Schnitzel ‘a chop’.
Other syntactic items may be subcategorised for,
too, e.g. both stellen and its English translation
put subcategorise for subject, direct object, and a
prepositional phrase (PP) like on the shelf :
(5) [
NP
Al] put [
NP
the book] [
PP
on the shelf].
Subcategorisation frames describe a combina-
tion of arguments required by a specific verb. The
set of SCFs for a verb is called its subcategori-
sation preference. Our system follows much pre-
vious work by counting PPs that accompany the
verb among its complements, even though they are
not obligatory (so-called ‘adjuncts’), because PP
adjuncts are excellent clues to a verb’s semantics
(Sun et al., 2008). However, nominal and clausal
adjuncts do not count as verbal complements.
SCF information can benefit all applications
that need information on predicate-argument struc-
ture, e.g., parsing, verb clustering, semantic role la-
belling, or machine translation. Automatic acquisi-
tion of SCF information with minimal supervision
is also crucial to construct useful resources quickly.
The main innovation of the presented new sys-
tem is to address two challenges simultaneously,
viz., SCF acquisition from raw text and the focus
on languages with a very free word order. With
this system, we create an SCF lexicon for German
verbs and evaluate this lexicon against a previously
published manual verb classification, showing bet-
ter performance than has been reported until now.
After an overview of previous work on SCF ac-
quisition in Section 2, Section 3 describes our sub-
categorisation acquisition system, and Section 4
the SCF lexicon that we build using it. In Sec-
tions 5 and 6 we evaluate the SCF lexicon on a verb
classification task and discuss our results; Section 7
then concludes with directions for future work.
298
2 Previous work
To date, research on SCF acquisition from corpora
has mostly targeted English. Brent and Berwick
(1991) detect five SCFs by looking for attested
contexts where argument slots are filled by closed-
class lexical items (pronouns or proper names).
Briscoe and Carroll (1997) detect 163 SCFs with
a system that builds an SCF lexicon whose en-
tries include the relative frequency of SCF classes.
Potential SCF patterns are extracted from a cor-
pus parsed with a dependency-based parser, and
then filtered by hypothesis testing on binomial fre-
quency data. Korhonen (2002) refines Briscoe and
Carroll (1997)’s system using back-off estimates
on the WordNet semantic class of the verb’s pre-
dominant sense, assuming that semantically similar
verbs have similar SCFs, following Levin (1993).
Some current statistical methods for Semantic Role
Labelling build models that also capture subcat-
egorisation information, e.g., Grenager and Man-
ning (2006). Schulte im Walde (2009) offers a re-
cent survey of the SCF acquisition literature.
SCF acquisition is also an important step in the
automatic semantic role labelling (Grenager and
Manning, 2006; Lang and Lapata, 2010; Titov and
Klementiev, 2012). Semantic roles of a verb de-
scribe the kind of involvement of entities in the
event introduced by the verb, e.g., as agent (active,
often not affected by the event) or patient (passive,
often affected). On the basis of these SCFs, se-
mantic roles can be assigned due to the interdepen-
dence between semantic roles and their syntactic
realisations, called Argument Linking (Levin, 1993;
Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005).
Acquiring SCFs for languages with a very fixed
word order like English needs only a simple syn-
tactic analysis, which mainly relies on the prede-
termined sequencing of arguments in the sentence,
e.g., Grenager and Manning (2006). When word
order is freer, the analysis gets more complicated,
and must include a full syntactic parse.
What is more, German is a counterexample to
Manning’s (1993) expectation that freedom of
word order should be matched by an increase in
case and/or agreement marking. This is due to a
very high degree of syncretism (identity of word
forms) in German paradigms for nouns, adjectives,
and determiners. E.g., the noun Auto ‘car’ has only
two forms, Auto for nominative, dative, and ac-
cusative singular, and Autos for genitive singular
and all four plural forms. This is in contrast to some
other free word order languages for which SCF
acquisition has been studied, like Modern Greek
(Maragoudakis et al., 2000) and Czech (Sarkar and
Zeman, 2000). A one-many relation between word
forms and case is also one of the problems for SCF
acquisition in Urdu (Ghulam, 2011).
For German, initial studies used semi-automatic
techniques and manual evaluation (Eckle-Kohler,
1999; Wauschkuhn, 1999). The first automatic sub-
categorisation acquisition system for German is de-
scribed by Schulte im Walde (2002a), who defined
an SCF inventory and manually wrote a grammar
to analyse verb constructions according to these
frames. A lexicalised PCFG parser using this gram-
mar was trained on 18.7 million words of German
newspaper text; the trained parser model contained
explicit subcategorisation frequencies, which could
then be extracted to construct a subcategorisation
lexicon for 14,229 German verbs. This work was
evaluated against a German dictionary, the Duden
Stilw¨orterbuch (Schulte im Walde, 2002b).
Schulte im Walde and Brew (2002) used the sub-
categorisation lexicon created by the system to au-
tomatically induce a set of semantic verb classes
with an unsupervised clustering algorithm. This
clustering was evaluated against a small manually
created semantic verb classification. Schulte im
Walde (2006) continues this work using a larger
manual verb classification. The SCFs used in this
study are defined at three levels of granularity. The
first level (38 different SCFs) lists only the comple-
ments in the frame; the second one adds head and
case information for PP complements (183 SCFs).
The third level examined the effect of adding selec-
tional preferences, but results were inconclusive.
A recent paper (Scheible et al., 2013) describes a
system similar to ours, built on a statistical depen-
dency parser, and using some of the same kinds
of rules as we describe in Section 3.1; this system
is evaluated in a task-based way (e.g., to improve
the performance of a SMT system) and cannot be
directly compared to our system in this paper.
3 The SCF acquisition system
This section describes the first contribution of this
paper, a state-of-the-art subcategorisation acquisi-
tion system for German. Its core component is a
rule-based SCF tagger which operates on phrase
structure analyses, as delivered by a statistical
parser. Given a parse of a sentence, the tagger as-
signs each finite verb in the sentence an SCF type.
299
We use the SCF inventory of Schulte im Walde
(2002a), which includes complements like n for
nominative subject, a for accusative direct object,
d for dative indirect object, r for reflexive pronoun,
and x for expletive es (‘it’) subject. Clausal com-
plements can be infinite (i); finite ones can have
the verb in second position (S-2) or include the
complementiser dass ‘that’ (S-dass). Comple-
ments can be combined as in na (transitive verb);
for PPs in SCFs, the head is specified, e.g., p:f¨ur
for PP complements headed by f¨ur ‘for’
1
.
Due to the free word order, simple phrase struc-
ture like that used for analysis of English is not
enough to specify the syntax of German sentences.
Therefore we use the annotation scheme in the
manually constructed German treebanks NEGRA
and TIGER (Skut et al., 1997; Brants et al., 2002),
which decorate parse trees with edge labels specify-
ing the syntactic roles of constituents. We automat-
ically annotate the parse trees from our statistical
parser using a simple machine learning model.
In the next section, we illustrate the operation of
the SCF tagger with reference to examples; then in
Section 3.2 we describe our edge labeller.
3.1 The SCF tagger
The SCF tagger begins by collecting complements
co-occurring with a verb instance using the phrase
structure of the sentence. In our system, we obtain
phrase structure information for unannotated text
using the Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al., 2006), a
statistical unlexicalised parser trained on TIGER.
Fig. 1 illustrates the phrase structure analysis and
edge labels in the TIGER corpus for (6):
(6) Das hielte ich f¨ur moralisch außerordentlich
fragw¨urdig.
‘I’d consider that morally extremely
questionable’.
Its finite verb hielte (from halten ‘hold’) has
three complements, the subject ich ‘I’, edge-
labelled with SB, the direct object das ‘that’, la-
belled with OA, and a PP headed by f¨ur ‘for’ (MO
stands for ‘modifier’). After collecting comple-
ments, the SCF tagger uses this edge label infor-
mation to determine the complements’ syntactic
roles, and assigns the verb the corresponding SCF;
in the case of halten above, the SCF is nap:f¨ur.
1
We digress from Schulte im Walde’s original SCF inven-
tory in that we do not indicate case information in PPs.
The rule-based SCF tagger handles auxiliary and
modal verb constructions, passive alternations, sep-
arable verb prefixes, and raising and control con-
structions. E.g., the subject sie ‘they’ of anfangen
‘begin’ in (7) doubles as the subject of its infinite
clausal complement; hence, it shows up in the SCF
of the complement’s head geben ‘give’, too:
(7) Sie fingen an, mir Stromschl¨age zu geben.
‘They started to give me electric shocks.’
The tagger also handles involved cases with
many complements, including PPs and clauses as
in (8). As the SCF inventory allows at most three
complements in an SCF, such cases call for pri-
oritising of verbal complements (e.g., subjects, ob-
jects, and clausal complements are preferred over
PP complements). Consequently, the main verb
empfehlen ‘recommend’ in (8), which has a subject,
a dative object, a PP, and an infinitival clausal com-
plement, is assigned the SCF ndi. Another chal-
lenging task which relies on edge label information
is filtering out clausal adjuncts (relative clauses and
parentheticals) so as not to include them in SCFs.
(8) [
PP
Am Freitag] empfahl [
NP:Nom
der
Aufsichtsrat] [
NP:Dat
den Aktion¨aren], [
S
das
Angebot abzulehnen].
‘On Friday the board of directors advised
shareholders to turn down the offer.’
The 17 rules of the SCF tagger are simple; most
of them categorise the complements of a specific
verb instance; e.g., if a nominal complement to the
verb is edge-labelled as a nominative subject, add n
to the verb’s SCF, unless the verb is in the passive,
in which case add a to the SCF.
Our system was optimised by progressively re-
fining the SCF tagger’s rules through manual error
analysis on sentences from TIGER. The result is
an automatic SCF tagger that is resilient to varia-
tions in sentence structure and is firmly based on
linguistically motivated knowledge. As a test case
for its linguistic soundness, we chose the perfect
parses in the TIGER treebank and found that the
tagger is very accurate in capturing subcategorisa-
tion information inherent in these data.
3.2 The edge labeller
To obtain edge label information for the parses de-
livered by the Berkeley Parser, we built a novel
machine learning classifier to annotate parse trees

with TIGER edge label information. This edge la-
beller is a maximum entropy (multiclass logistic
regression) model built using the Stanford Classi-
fier package
2
. We include features such as:
• The part of speech of the complement;
• The first word of the complement;
• The lexical head of the complement;
• N-grams on the end of the lexical head of the
complement;
• The kind of article of a complement;
• The presence or absence of specific article
forms in other complements to the same verb;
• Position of the complement with respect to a
reflexive pronoun in the sentence;
• The lemmatised form of the verb governing
the complement (i.e., the verb on which the
complement depends syntactically);
• The clause type of the governing verb; and,
• Active or passive voice of the governing verb.
We do no tuning and use the software’s default
hyperparameters (L2 regularisation with ? = 3).
This classifier was trained from edge label data
extracted from the NEGRA and TIGER corpora;
our training set contained 300,000 samples (ap-
proximately 25% from NEGRA and 75% from
TIGER). On a held-out test set of 10% (contain-
ing 34,000 samples), the classifier achieves a final
F-score of 95.5% on the edge labelling task.
The edge labeller makes the simplifying assump-
tion that verbal complements can be labelled inde-
pendently. Consequently, it tends to annotate multi-
ple complements as subject for each verb. This has
to do with the numerical dominance of subjects,
which make up about 40% of all verb complements,
more than three times the number of the next most
common complement type (direct object).
Therefore we first collect all possible labels with
associated probabilities that the edge labeller as-
2
http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/
classifier.shtml
signs to each complement of a verb. We then
choose the set of labels with the highest probability
that includes at most one subject and at most one
accusative direct object for the verb, assuming that
the joint probability of a set of labels is the product
of the individual label probabilities.
We use our edge labeller in this work for mor-
phological disambiguation of nominals and for
identifying clausal adjuncts, but the edge labeller
is a standalone reusable component, which might
be equally well be used to mark up parse trees for,
e.g., a semantic role labelling system.
4 The subcategorisation lexicon
With the system described in Sec. 3, we build a Ger-
man subcategorisation lexicon that collects counts
of ?lemma,SCF? on deWaC (Baroni et al., 2009),
a corpus of text extracted from Web search re-
sults, with 10
9
words automatically POS-tagged
and lemmatised by the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).
A subset of this corpus, SdeWaC (Faaß and Eckart,
2013), has been preprocessed to include only sen-
tences which are maximally parsable; this smaller
corpus includes 880 million words in 45 million
sentences. We parsed 3 million sentences (80 mil-
lion words) of SdeWaC; after filtering out those
verb lemmas seen only five times or fewer in the
corpus, we are left with statistics on 8 million verb
instances, representing 9,825 verb lemmas.
As a concrete example for the resulting SCF lexi-
con, consider the entry for sprechen ‘talk’ in Fig. 2,
which occurs 16,254 times in our SCF lexicon.
Sprechen refers to a conversation with speaker,
hearer, topic, message, and code: Speakers are ex-
pressed by nominative NPs, hearers, by mit-, bei-
or zu-PPs, topics, by von- and ¨uber-PPs. The code
is expressed in in-PPs, and the message, by ac-
cusative NPs (einige Worte sprechen ‘to say a few
words’), main-clause complements or subordinate
dass (‘that’) sentences. Other uses of the verb are
301
np:von (2715), n (2696), na (1380), np:mit
(1247), np:in (1132), nS-2 (1064), np:¨uber
(853), np:f¨ur (695), nS-dass (491), np:zu
(307), nap:in (280), nap:von (275), ni (261),
np:bei (212), np:gegen (192), np:an (186),
naS-2 (172), np:aus (168), np:auf (112),
nap:¨uber (112)
Figure 2: SCF lexicon for sprechen
figurative , e.g., sprechen gegen ‘be a counterar-
gument to’. As the distinction between arguments
and adjuncts is gradual in our system, some adjunct
patterns appear in the lexicon, too, but only with
low frequency, e.g., np:auf, in which the auf -PP
expresses the setting of the conversation, as in auf
der Tagung sprechen ‘speak at the convention’.
For reference, we also constructed an SCF lexi-
con from the NEGRA and TIGER corpora, which
together comprise about 1.2 million words. This
SCF lexicon contains statistics on 133,897 verb
instances (5,316 verb lemmas). While the manual
annotations in NEGRA and TIGER mean that this
SCF lexicon has virtually no noise, the small size
of the corpora results in problems with data spar-
sity and negatively impacts the utility of this re-
source (see discussion in Section 6.2).
5 Automatic verb classification
The remainder of the paper sets out to establish the
relevance of our SCF acquisition system by com-
parison to previous work. As stated in Sec. 2, the
only prior automatic German SCF acquisition sys-
tem is that of Schulte im Walde (2002a), which was
evaluated directly against an electronic version of
a large dictionary; as this is not an open access
resource, we cannot perform a similar evaluation.
We opt therefore to use a task-based evaluation
to compare our system directly with Schulte im
Walde’s, and leave manual evaluation for future
work. We refer back to the experiment set up by
Schulte im Walde (2006) to automatically induce
classifications of German verbs by clustering them
on the basis of their SCF preferences as listed in
her SCF lexicon. By casting this experiment as a
fixed task, we can compare our system directly to
hers. The link between subcategorisation and verb
semantics is linguistically sound, due to the inter-
dependence between verb meanings and the num-
ber and kinds of their syntactic arguments (Levin,
1993; Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 2005). E.g.,
only transitive verbs that denote a change of state
like cut and break enter in the middle construction
(The bread cuts easily.), with the patient or theme
argument appearing as the syntactic subject. Thus,
verbs whose SCF preferences show such an alter-
nation can be predicted to denote a change of state.
We adopt the automatic verb classification
paradigm to evaluate our system, replicating
Schulte im Walde’s (2006) experiment to the best
of our ability. We argue that by evaluating our
SdeWaC SCF lexicon described in the previous
section, we simultaneously evaluate our subcate-
gorisation acquisition system; this technique also
allows us to demonstrate the semantic relevance of
our SCF lexicon. Section 5.1 introduces the man-
ual verb classification we use as a gold standard
and Section 5.2 describes our unsupervised clus-
tering technique. Our evaluation of the clustering
against the gold standard then follows in Section 6.
5.1 Manual verb classifications
The semantic verb classification proposed by
Schulte im Walde (2006, page 162ff.), hereafter
SiW2006, comprises 168 high- and low-frequency
verbs grouped into 43 semantic classes, with be-
tween 2 and 7 verbs per class. Examples of these
classes are Aspect (e.g., anfangen ‘begin’), Propo-
sitional Attitude (e.g., denken ‘think’), Transfer of
Possession (Obtaining) (e.g., bekommen ‘get’), and
Weather (e.g., regnen ‘rain’). Some of the classes
are subclassified
3
, e.g., Manner of Motion, with
the subclasses Locomotion (klettern ‘climb’), Ro-
tation (rotieren ‘rotate’), Rush (eilen ‘hurry’), Ve-
hicle (fliegen ‘fly’), and Flotation (gleiten ‘glide’).
These classes are related to Levin classes in that
some are roughly equivalent to a Levin class (e.g.,
Aspect and Levin’s Begin class), others are sub-
groups of Levin classes, e.g., Position is a sub-
group of Levin’s Dangle class; finally, some classes
lump together Levin classes, e.g., Transfer of Pos-
session (Obtaining) combines Levin’s Get and Ob-
tain classes. This shows that these classes could be
integrated into a large-scale classification of Ger-
man verbs in the style of Levin (1993).
5.2 Clustering
From the counts of ?lemma,SCF? in the SCF lexi-
con, we can estimate the conditional probability
that a particular verb v appears with an SCF f :
3
For the purpose of our evaluation, we disregard class-
subclass relations and consider subclasses as separate entities.
302
P (scf = f |lemma = v). We smooth these con-
ditional probability distributions by backing off to
the prior probability P (scf) (Katz, 1987).
With these smoothed conditional probabilities,
we cluster verbs with k-means clustering (Forgy,
1965), a hard clustering technique, which partitions
a set of objects into k clusters. The algorithm is ini-
tialised with a starting set of k cluster centroids; it
then proceeds iteratively, first assigning each ob-
ject to the cluster whose centroid is closest under
some distance measure, and then calculating new
centroids to represent the centres of the updated
clusters. The algorithm terminates when the assign-
ment of objects to clusters no longer changes.

skew(p, q) = D(p??q + (1? ?)p) (11)
In our experiments, verbs are represented by
their conditional probability distributions over
SCFs. As distance measures, we use two variants
of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (9), a measure
of the dissimilarity of two probability distributions.
The KL divergence from p to q is undefined if at
some point q but not p is zero, so we use measures
based on KL without this problem, viz., the in-
formation radius (aka Jensen-Shannon divergence,
a symmetric metric, (10)), as well as skew diver-
gence (an asymmetric dissimilarity measure which
smoothes q by interpolating it to a small degree
with p, (11)), where we set the interpolation param-
eter to be ? = 0.9, to make our results comparable
to Schulte im Walde’s (2006)
4
.
As mentioned, the k-means algorithm is ini-
tialised with a set of cluster centroids; in this study,
we initialise the centroids by random partitions
(each of the n objects is randomly assigned to one
of k clusters, and the centroids are then computed
as the means of these random partitions). Because
the random initial centroids influence the final clus-
tering, we repeat the clustering a number of times.
We also initialise the k-means cluster centroids
using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a de-
terministic iterative bottom-up process. Hierarchi-
cal clustering initially assigns verbs to singleton
clusters; the two clusters which are “nearest” to
4
Schulte im Walde (2006) takes ? = 0.9 although Lee
(1999) recommends ? = 0.99 or higher values in her original
description of skew divergence.
each other are then joined together, and this pro-
cess is repeated until the desired number of clusters
is obtained. Hierarchical clustering is performed
to group the verbs into k clusters; the centroids
of these clusters are then used to initialise the k-
means algorithm. While there exist several variants
of hierarchical clustering, we use Ward’s method
(Ward, Jr, 1963) for merging clusters, which at-
tempts to minimise the variance inside clusters;
Ward’s criterion was previously found to be the
most effective hierarchical clustering technique for
verb classification (Schulte im Walde, 2006).
6 Evaluation
This section presents the results of evaluating the
unsupervised verb clustering based on our SCF lex-
ica against the gold standard described in Sec. 5.1.
6.1 Results
We use two cluster purity measures, defined in
Fig. 3; we intentionally target our numerical eval-
uations to be directly comparable with previous
results in the literature. As k-means is a hard clus-
tering algorithm, we consider a clustering C to be
an equivalence relation that partitions n verbs into
k disjoint subsets C = {C
1
, . . . , C
k
}.
The first of these purity measures, adjusted Rand
index (Rand
a
in Eq. (12)) judges clustering simi-
larity using the notion of the overlap between a
cluster C
i
in a given clustering C and a cluster G
j
in a gold standard clustering G, this value being
denoted by CG
ij
= |C
i
? G
j
|; values of Rand
a
range between 0 for chance and 1 for perfect cor-
relation. The other metric, the pairwise F -score
(PairF, Eq. (13)), operates by constructing a con-
tingency table on the
(
n
2
)
pairs of verbs, the idea
being that the gold standard provides binary judge-
ments about whether two verbs should be clustered
together or not. If a clustering agrees with the gold
standard in clustering a pair of verbs together or
separately, this is a “correct” answer; by extension,
information retrieval measures such as precision
(P ) and recall (R) can be computed.
Table 1 shows the performance of our SCF lex-
ica, evaluated against the SiW2006 gold standard.
The random baseline is given by PairF = 2.08 and
Rand
a
= ?0.004 (calculated as the average of 50
random partitions). The optimal baseline is PairF
= 95.81 and Rand
a
= 0.909, calculated by evalu-
ating the gold standard against itself. As the gold
standard includes polysemous verbs, which belong

the average is then taken over 50 such trials.
We cluster using k = 43, matching the number
of clusters in the gold standard. Of the 168 verbs in

We report the results using k-means clustering

both the initial partition found by Ward’s method
and the k-means solution based on it are shown.
For comparison, we list the results of Schulte
im Walde (2006, p. 174, Table 7) for the second
level of SCF granularity, with PP head and case
information (see Sec. 2 for Schulte im Walde’s
analysis). While this seems the most appropriate
comparison to draw, since we also collect statis-
tics about PPs, it is ambitious because, as noted
in Section 3, our SCF lexica lack case informa-
tion about PPs.

Compared to Schulte im Walde’s
numbers, the NEGRA/TIGER SCF lexicon scores
significantly worse on the PairF evaluation metric
under all conditions, and also on the Rand

metric

PP case information is relevant for prepositions that can

Statistical significance is calculated by running repeated
k-means clusterings with random partition initialisation and
evaluating the results using the relevant purity metrics. These
repeated clustering scores represent a random variable (a func-

6.2 Discussion
Sec. 6.1 compared the SCF lexicon created us-
ing SdeWaC with the lexicon built by Schulte im
Walde (2002a), showing that our lexicon achieves
significantly better results on the verb clustering
task. We interpret this to be indicative of a more
accurate subcategorisation lexicon, and, by exten-
sion, of a more accurate SCF acquisition system.
We attribute this superior performance primar-
ily to our use of a statistical parser as opposed to
a hand-written grammar. This design choice has
several advantages. First, the parser delivers robust
syntactic analyses, which we can expect to be rel-
atively domain-independent. Second, we make no
prior assumptions about the variety of subcategori-
sation phenomena that might appear in text, decou-
pling the identification of SCFs from the ability
to parse natural language. Third, the fact that our
parser and edge labeller are trained on the 800,000
word NEGRA/TIGER corpus means that we bene-
fit from the linguistic expertise that went into build-
ing that treebank. Our use of off-the-shelf tools
(the parser and our simple yet effective machine
learning model describing edge label information)
makes our system considerably simpler and easier
to implement than Schulte im Walde’s. We see our
system as more easily extensible to other languages
for which there is a parser and an initial syntacti-
cally annotated corpus to train the edge labeller on.
The NEGRA/TIGER SCF lexicon performs not
as well on the verb clustering evaluations, as fewer
verbs are attested in NEGRA/TIGER compared to
the SdeWaC SCF lexicon and gold standard clus-
terings. Data sparsity can be a problem in SCF ac-
quisition; all other factors being equal, using more
data to construct an SCF lexicon should make pat-
terns in the language more readily visible and re-
duce the chance of missing a particular lemma-
SCF combination accidentally. A secondary ef-
fect is that models of verb subcategorisation prefer-
ences like the ones used here can be more precisely
estimated as the counts of observed verb instances
increase, particularly for low-frequency verbs.
Error analysis of our SCF lexicon reveals low
counts of expletive subjects. The edge labeller is
supposed to annotate semantically empty subjects
(es, ‘it’) as expletive; for clusterings examined in
Sec. 5.1, this would affect weather verbs (e.g., es
tion of the random cluster centroids used to initialise the k-
means clustering). These samples are normally distributed, so
we determine statistical significance using a t-test against the
“Random Mean” results reported by Schulte im Walde (2006).
regnet, ‘it’s raining’). However, in our SdeWaC
SCF lexicon, expletive subjects are clearly under-
represented. Our SCF lexicon built on TIGER,
where expletive subjects are systematically la-
belled, has the SCF xa as the most common SCF
for the verb geben (in es gibt ‘there is’). In con-
trast, in our SdeWaC SCF lexicon, the most com-
mon SCF is the transitive na, with xa in seventh
place. I.e., the edge labeller does not identify all
expletive subjects, which is due to the fact that ex-
pletive subjects are syntactically indistinguishable
from neuter pronominal subjects, so the edge la-
beller does not have a rich feature set to inform it
about this category. But since, statistically, exple-
tive pronouns make up less than 1% of subjects
in TIGER, the prior probability of labelling a con-
stituent as expletive is very low. Due to these fig-
ures, we do not expect this issue to seriously impact
the quality of our verb classification evaluations.
7 Future work
In this paper we have presented a state-of-
the-art subcategorisation acquisition system for
free-word order languages, and used it to cre-
ate a large subcategorisation frame lexicon for
German verbs. Our SCF lexicon resource is
available at http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.
de/˜robertsw/scflex.html. We are per-
forming a manual evaluation of the output of our
system, which we will report soon.
We plan to continue this work first by expanding
our SCF lexicon with case information and selec-
tional preferences, second by using our SCF clas-
sifier and lexicon for verbal Multiword Expression
identification in German, and last by comparing
it to existing verb classifications, either by using
available resources for German like the SALSA
corpus (Burchardt et al., 2006), or by translating
parts of VerbNet into German to create a more
extensive gold standard for verb clustering in the
spirit of Sun et al. (2010) who found that Levin’s
verb classification can be translated to French and
still usefully allow generalisation over verb classes.
Finally, we plan to perform in vivo evaluation
of our SCF lexicon, to determine what benefit
it can deliver for NLP applications such as Se-
mantic Role Labelling and Word Sense Disam-
biguation. Recent research has found that even
automatically-acquired verb classifications can be
useful for NLP applications (Shutova et al., 2010;
Guo et al., 2011).
