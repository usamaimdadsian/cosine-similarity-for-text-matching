Abstract
In this paper we propose a computational
method for determining the orthographic
similarity between Romanian and related
languages. We account for etymons and
cognates and we investigate not only the
number of related words, but also their
forms, quantifying orthographic similari-
ties. The method we propose is adaptable
to any language, as far as resources are
available.
1 Introduction
Language relatedness and language change across
space and time are two of the main questions of the
historical and comparative linguistics (Rama and
Borin, 2014). Many comparative methods have
been used to establish relationships between lan-
guages, to determine language families and to re-
construct their proto-languages (Durie and Ross,
1996). If grouping of languages in linguistic fam-
ilies is generally accepted, the relationships be-
tween languages belonging to the same family are
periodically investigated. In spite of the fact that
linguistic literature abounds in claims of classifi-
cation of natural languages, the degrees of similar-
ity between languages are far from being certain.
In many situations, the similarity of natural lan-
guages is a fairly vague notion, both linguists and
non-linguists having intuitions about which lan-
guages are more similar to which others. McMa-
hon and McMahon (2003) and Rama and Borin
(2014) note that the computational historical lin-
guistics did not receive much attention until the
beginning of the 1990s, and argue for the necessity
of development of quantitative and computational
methods in this field.
1.1 Related Work
According to Campbell (2003), the methods based
on comparisons of cognate lists and sound corre-
spondences are the most popular approaches em-
ployed for establishing relationships between lan-
guages. Barbanc¸on et al. (2013) emphasize the va-
riety of computational methods used in this field,
and state that the differences in datasets and ap-
proaches cause difficulties in the evaluation of the
results regarding the reconstruction of the phylo-
genetic tree of languages. Linguistic phylogeny
reconstruction proves especially useful in histor-
ical and comparative linguistics, as it enables the
analysis of language evolution. Ringe et al. (2002)
propose a computational method for evolutionary
tree reconstruction based on a “perfect phylogeny”
algorithm; using a Bayesian phylogeographic ap-
proach, Alekseyenko et al. (2012), continuing the
work of Atkinson et al. (2005), model the expan-
sion of the Indo-European language family and
find support for the hypothesis which places its
homeland in Anatolia; Atkinson and Gray (2006)
analyze language divergence dates and argue for
the usage of computational phylogenetic meth-
ods in the question of Indo-European age and ori-
gins. Using modified versions of Swadesh’s lists
1
,
Dyen et al. (1992) investigate the classification of
Indo-European languages by applying a lexicosta-
tistical method.
The similarity of languages is interesting not
only for historical and comparative linguistics,
but for machine translation and language acqui-
sition as well. Scannell (2006) and Haji?c et al.
(2000) argue for the possibility of obtaining a bet-
ter translation quality using simple methods for
very closely related languages. Koppel and Ordan
(2011) study the impact of the distance between
languages on the translation product and conclude
that it is directly correlated with the ability to dis-
tinguish translations from a given source language
from non-translated text. Some genetically re-
lated languages are so similar to each other, that
1
http://www.wordgumbo.com/ie/cmp/iedata.txt
1047
speakers of such languages are able to communi-
cate without prior instruction (Gooskens, 2007).
Gooskens et al. (2008) analyze several phonetic
and lexical predictors and their conclusion is that
lexical similarity can be seen as a predictor of lan-
guage intelligibility. The impact of language sim-
ilarities in the process of second language acquisi-
tion is argued by the contrastive analysis hypoth-
esis, which claims that where similarities between
the first and the second language occur, the acqui-
sition would be easier compared with the situation
in which there were differences between the two
languages (Benati and VanPatten, 2011).
1.2 Our Approach
Although there are multiple aspects that are rele-
vant in the study of language relatedness, such as
the orthographic, phonetic, syntactic and semantic
differences, in this paper we focus only on the or-
thographic similarity. The orthographic approach
relies on the idea that sound changes leave traces
in the orthography, and alphabetic character cor-
respondences represent, to a fairly large extent,
sound correspondences (Delmestri and Cristianini,
2010).
In this paper we propose an orthographic simi-
larity method focused on etymons (direct sources
of the words in a foreign language) and cognates
(words in different languages having the same ety-
mology and a common ancestor). In a broadly ac-
cepted sense, the higher the similarity degree be-
tween two languages, the closer they are.
One of our motivations is that when people en-
counter a language for the first time in written
form, it is most likely that they can distinguish and
individualize words which resemble words from
their native language. These words are proba-
bly either inherited from their mother tongue (ety-
mons), or have a common ancestor with the words
in their language (cognates).
Our first goal is, given a corpus C, to automat-
ically detect etymons and cognates. In Section 2
we propose a dictionary-based approach to auto-
matically extract related words, and a method for
computing the orthographic similarity of natural
languages. Most of the traditional approaches in
this field focus either on etymology detection or
on cognate identification, most of them reporting
results only on small sets of cognate pairs (usually
manually determined lists of about 200 cognates,
for which the cognate judgments are made by hu-
man experts (Rama and Borin, 2014)). Our ap-
proach implies a detailed investigation which ac-
counts not only for the number of related words,
as it is usually done in lexicostatistics (where the
relationships between languages are determined
based on the percentage of related words), but also
for their forms, quantifying orthographic similari-
ties. We employ three string similarity metrics for
a finer-grained analysis, as related words in dif-
ferent languages do not have identical forms and
their partial similarity implies different degrees of
recognition and comprehensibility. For example,
the Romanian word lun?a (moon) is closer to its
Latin etymon luna than the word b?atrˆan (old) to
its etymon veteranus, and the Romanian word vˆant
(wind) is closer to its French cognate pair vent than
the word castel (castle) to its cognate pair chˆateau.
In this paper we investigate the orthographic
similarity between Romanian and related lan-
guages. Romanian is a Romance language, be-
longing to the Italic branch of the Indo-European
language family, and is of particular interest re-
garding its geographic setting. It is surrounded
by Slavic languages and its relationship with the
big Romance kernel was difficult. Besides gen-
eral typological comparisons that can be made
between any two or more languages, Romanian
can be studied based on comparisons of ge-
netic and geographical nature, participating in nu-
merous areally-based similarities that define the
Balkan convergence area. Joseph (1999) states
that, regarding the genetic relationships, Roma-
nian can be studied in the context of those lan-
guages most closely related to it and that the
well-studied Romance languages enable compar-
isons that might not be possible otherwise, within
less well-documented families of languages. The
position of Romanian within the Romance fam-
ily is controversial (McMahon and McMahon,
2003): either marginal or more integrated within
the group, depending on the versions of the cog-
nate lists that are used in the analysis.
In Section 3.1 we apply our method on Roma-
nian in different stages of its evolution, running
our experiments on high-volume corpora from
three historical periods: the period approximately
between 1642 and 1743, the second half of 19
th
century (1870 - 1889), and the present period. In
Section 3.2 we make use of a fourth corpus, Eu-
roparl, with a double goal: on the one hand, to
check if degrees of similarity between Romanian
1048
and other languages in the present period are con-
sistent across two different corpora, and on the
other hand, to investigate whether there are dif-
ferences between the overall degrees of similarity
obtained for the entire corpus and those obtained
in various experiments at sentence level. The con-
clusions of our paper are outlined in Section 4.
2 Methodology and Algorithm
In this section we introduce a technique for deter-
mining the orthographic similarity of languages.
In order to obtain accurate results, we investigate
both etymons and cognates. First, we automati-
cally identify etymons and cognates, then we mea-
sure the distances between related words, and fi-
nally we compute the overall degrees of similarity
between pairs of languages. We also applied this
method for investigating the mutual intelligibility
of the Romance languages, and preliminary results
are presented in (Ciobanu and Dinu, 2014b).
2.1 Similarity Method
Let C  tw

N

are ordered such that C

N
lingua
u
is the subset of C containing all the words that
have an etymon or a cognate pair in L

. We use
the following notations: N

token words in C, N
lingua
is the number of token
words in C
L
, ? is the empty string and x
i
is the
etymon or cognate pair of w

. Given a string

and
L

(non-metric distance), with frequency support
from corpus C, as follows:

Table 1: Statistics for the Romanian datasets.
represented in Figure 2, is applicable to any lan-
guage. After a preprocessing phase, which is de-
tailed in Subsection 2.2.1, we analyze words and
begin by identifying their etymologies.
2.2.1 Preprocessing
Given a corpus C, we start by preprocessing the
text.
Step 1. Data Cleaning. We perform basic
word segmentation, using whitespace and punc-
tuation marks as delimiters and we lower-case all
words. We remove from the datasets tokens that
are irrelevant for our investigation, such as dates,
numbers and non-textual annotations marked by
non-alphanumeric characters.
Step 2. Stop Words Removal. We focus on
analyzing word content and, in order to obtain
relevant results, we remove stop words from the
datasets. We use the lists of stop words for Roma-
nian provided by the Apache Lucene
2
text search
engine library. In Table 1 we list the total number
of stop words from each corpus.
2
http://lucene.apache.org
1049
Step 3. Lemmatization. We use lemmas for
identifying words’ definitions in dictionaries and
for computing adequate distances between words
and their cognates or etymons. We use the Dex-
online
3
machine-readable dictionary to lemmatize
Romanian words.
Step 4. Diacritics Removal. Many words have
undergone transformations by the augmentation of
language-specific diacritics when entering a new
language. From an orthographic perspective, the
resemblance of words is higher between words
without diacritics than between words with dia-
critics. For example, the orthographic distance
is higher for the Romanian word amicit¸ie (friend-
ship) and its French cognate pair amiti´e than for
their corresponding forms without diacritics, am-
icitie and amitie. For this reason, in this step
of our procedure we create two versions of each
dataset, with and without diacritics, in order to fur-
ther investigate the influence of the diacritics on
the cross-language orthographic similarity. In Ro-
manian, 5 diacritics are used today: ?a, ˆ?, ˆa, s¸, t¸.
2.2.2 Relationships Identification
Step 1. Etymology Detection. For most words,
etymological dictionaries offer a unique etymol-
ogy, but when more options are possible for ex-
plaining a word’s etymology (there are words
whose etymology was and remains difficult to
ascertain), dictionaries may provide multiple al-
ternatives. For example, the Romanian word
parlament (parliament) has a double etymology:
French (with the etymon parlement) and Italian
(with the etymon parlamento). We account for all
the given etymological hypotheses, enabling our
method to provide more accurate results.
For determining words’ etymologies we use the
Dexonline machine-readable dictionary, which is
an aggregation of over 30 Romanian dictionaries.
By parsing its definitions, we are able to automat-
ically extract information regarding words’ ety-
mologies and etymons. The most frequently used
pattern is shown below.
<abbr class="abbrev"
title="limba language_name">
language_abbreviation </abbr>
<b> origin_word </b>
As an example, we provide below an excerpt
from a Dexonline entry which uses this pattern to
3
http://dexonline.ro
specify the etymology of the Romanian word capi-
tol (chapter), which has double etymology: Latin
(with the etymon capitulum) and Italian (with the
etymon capitolo).
<b> CAP
´
ITOL </b>
<abbr class="abbrev"
title="limba italiana"> it. </abbr>
<b> capitolo </b>
<abbr class="abbrev"
title="limba latina"> lat. </abbr>
<b> capitulum </b>
Step 2. Cognate Identification. Cognates are
words in different languages having the same ety-
mology and a common ancestor. The methods for
cognate detection proposed so far are mostly based
on orthographic/phonetic and semantic similari-
ties (Kondrak, 2001; Frunza et al., 2005), but the
term “cognates” is often used with a somewhat dif-
ferent meaning, denoting words with high ortho-
graphic/phonetic and cross-lingual meaning simi-
larity, the condition of common etymology being
left aside. We focus on etymology and we intro-
duce an automatic strategy for detecting pairs of

cognates between two given languages, which en-
ables the identification of all cognate pairs for the
studied corpus.
Considering a set of words in a given language
L, to identify the cognate pairs between L and a re-
lated language L’, we first determine the etymolo-
gies of the given words. Then we translate in L’
all words without L’ etymology. We consider cog-
nate candidates pairs formed of input words and
their translations. Using electronic dictionaries,
we extract etymology-related information for the
translated words. To identify cognates, we com-
pare, for each pair of candidates, the etymologies
and the etymons. If they match, we identify the
words as being cognates.
In our previous work (Ciobanu and Dinu,
2014a) we applied this method on a Romanian dic-
tionary, while here we extract cognates from Ro-
manian corpora. We identify cognate pairs be-
tween Romanian and six other languages: Ital-
ian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and En-
glish. We use electronic dictionaries
4
to extract
etymology-related information and Google Trans-
late
5
to translate Romanian words. We are re-
stricted in our investigation by the available re-
sources, but we plan to extend our method to
other related languages as well. We selected
these six languages for the following reason: the
first four in our list are Romance languages, and
our intuition is that there are numerous words in
these languages which share a common ancestor
with Romanian words. We investigate the cog-
nate pairs for Turkish because many French words
were imported in both Romanian and Turkish in
the 19
th
century, and we believe that accounting
for Romanian-Turkish cognates would provide a
more accurate result for the similarity of these lan-

guages. As for English, we decided to investigate
the cognate pairs for this language in order to ana-
lyze to what extent the influence of English on Ro-
manian increases across time. In Table 2 we report
the number of Romanian words having an etymon
or a cognate pair in the six related languages.
Step 3. Evaluation. In order to evaluate our au-
tomatic method for extracting etymology-related
information and for detecting related words, we
excerpt a sample of 500 words for each of the
considered languages (Romanian, French, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish and English). The
samples are drawn using a proportionate stratifi-
cation sampling method with regard to the length
of the lemmas in our datasets. We manually deter-
mine the etymologies of the words in the samples,
and we compare these results with the automati-
cally obtained etymologies. We compute the accu-
racy for etymology extraction for each language,
and we obtain the following results: 95.8% accu-
racy for Romanian, 97.8% for Italian, 96.8% for
French, 96.6% for Spanish, 97.0% for Portuguese,
96.0% for Turkish and, finally, 97.2% for English.

2.2.3 Linguistic Distances
Various approaches have been previously em-
ployed for assessing the orthographic distance
or similarity between related words. Their per-
formance has been investigated and compared
(Frunza et al., 2005; Rama and Borin, 2014), but
a clear conclusion cannot be drawn with respect to
which method is the most appropriate for a given
task. We employ three metrics to determine the
orthographic similarity between related words. In
Subsection 3.1.2 we investigate to what extent the
similarity scores computed with each of these met-
rics differ, and whether the differences are statisti-
cally significant. We use the following metrics:
1051
• LCSR: The longest common subsequence
ratio (Melamed, 1995) is the longest common
subsequence of two strings u and v divided
by the length of the longer string. We sub-
tract this value from 1, in order to obtain the
distance between two words.
• EDIT: The edit distance (Levenshtein, 1965)
counts the minimum number of operations
(insertion, deletion and substitution) required
to transform one string into another. We use
a normalized version of the edit distance, di-
viding it by the length of the longer string.
• RD: The rank distance (Dinu and Dinu,
2005) is used to measure the similarity be-
tween two ranked lists. A ranking of a set
of n objects can be represented as a permuta-
tion of the integers 1, 2, ..., n. Let S be a set
of ranking results, ? P S. ?piq represents the
rank of object i in the ranking result ?. The
rank distance is computed as: RDp?, ?q 
°
n
i1
|?piq  ?piq|. The ranks of the ele-
ments are assigned from bottom up, i.e. from
n to 1, using the Borda count method (de
Borda, 1781). The elements which do not oc-
cur in any of the rankings receive the rank
0. To extend the rank distance to strings,
we index each occurrence of a given letter
a with a
k
, where k is the number of its pre-
vious occurrences, and then apply the rank
distance on the new indexed strings, which
become rankings in this situation. In order
to normalize it, we divide the rank distance
by the maximum possible distance between
two strings u and v (Dinu and Sgarro, 2006):
?

3 Experiments and Results
In this section we present the results obtained by
applying our method for determining orthographic
similarity on Romanian datasets.
To our knowledge, only basic lexicostatistical
methods (generally based on different dictionar-
ies or versions of the representative vocabulary
of Romanian) which compute the percentage of
words with a given etymology have been applied
for determining the relationships between Roma-
nian and related languages. Because of the diffi-
culty of setting the bounds between the basic lex-
icon and the remaining words, Graur (1968) uses
in his experiments three concentric versions of the
basic Romanian lexicon. Dinu (1996) reevaluates
the etymology detection for the three versions of
the basic Romanian lexicon and reclassifies the
lexical material. He argues against grouping to-
gether all the words with Slavic origins, without
differentiation between Old Slavic and languages
such as Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish.
Sala (1988) builds a version of the representative
vocabulary of Romanian comprising 2588 words,
which we use in our experiments as well.
3.1 Romanian Evolution
We apply our similarity method on high-volume
Romanian corpora from three distinct historical
periods of time, with different cultural, econom-
ical, political and social contexts. In Table 1 we
report statistics for these corpora and for the basic
Romanian lexicon.
3.1.1 Data
The first corpus consists of the transcription of the
parliamentary debates held in the Romanian Par-
liament from 1996 to 2007 (Grozea, 2012). The
second corpus consists of the publishing works of
Mihai Eminescu (Eminescu, 1980 1985), the lead-
ing Romanian poet. His works provide an insight-
ful description of the period between 1870 and
1889, with respect to its cultural, economical, so-
cial and political aspects, including some major
events in the Romanian history. Many researchers
consider that Eminescu had a crucial influence on
Romanian, his contribution to modern language
development being highly appreciated. The third
corpus dates back to the period approximately be-
tween 1642 and 1743, the beginning period of the
Romanian writing. Miron Costin, Grigore Ure-
che and Ion Neculce are Romanian chroniclers
whose main works follow one another in creat-
ing one of the most detailed and valuable descrip-
tions of Moldavia in that period, “Letopiset¸ul T¸?arii
Moldovei”. Along with them, Dimitrie Cantermir
contributed to the early development of the Roma-
nian writing, having written what is considered to
be the first attempt at a socio-political novel (“Isto-
ria Ieroglific?a”, 1703-1705). Their chronicles ac-
count for social, cultural, economical and political
events with the purpose of recreating historical pe-
riods of time. We also use the basic Romanian lex-
icon (Sala, 1988), abbreviated RVR, for our exper-
iments. The Dexonline machine-readable dictio-
nary, which we use for determining the etymolo-
gies for the Romanian words, aggregates defini-

tions from over 30 dictionaries ranging from 1927
to the present time and contains archaisms and
obsolete words (which are marked accordingly);
therefore, we are able to identify etymologies for
words in all used corpora.
3.1.2 Results
In this subsection we present and analyze the main
results drawn from our research. In Table 3 we
list the output of our method for each corpus, with
and without diacritics
6
. We report the similarity
between Romanian and related languages, provid-
ing the average value of the three metrics used. In
the %words column we provide, for each corpus,
the percentage of words having an etymon or a
cognate pair in a given language (the typical mea-
sure used in lexicostatistical comparison, i.e., the
0 distance function). The results for the Romanian
datasets are plotted in Figure 4 and Figure 5.
Cognate Influence. Table 3 and Figure 4
present the gain obtained by cognate analysis. Ac-
counting for cognates leads to an increase of sim-
ilarity between Romanian and Spanish and Por-
tuguese with almost 300%, and between Roma-
nian and Italian with almost 20%. Another spec-
tacular increase of closeness is for Turkish, which
draws closer to Romanian with more than 500%

The complete ranking of similarity is available online at
http://nlp.unibuc.ro/resources/rosim.pdf.
by using the cognate gain. The degree of sim-
ilarity is not given by the contribution of words
inherited in Romanian from Turkish (about 1%),
but by the pairs of shared cognates. Both Ro-
manian and Turkish borrowed words from French
massively towards the end of the 19
th
century.
Thus, most pairs of Romanian-Turkish cognates
have common French ancestors, and words in Ro-
manian and Turkish which resemble are actually
loans from the same French words. We also notice
a significant increase in similarity between Roma-
nian and English in the modern period. This in-
crease is natural and probably arises for the simi-
larity between English and most of the other lan-
guages as well. We notice that this increase is
due preponderantly to the cognate pairs. Most of
the Romanian-English cognates have a Romance
common ancestor (78.4% Latin, 4.2% French,
3.4% Italian), and 11.8% have a Greek common
ancestor, counted at lemma level on the corpus
comprising the parliamentary debates.
Romanian Evolution. Some significant results
can be observed in the evolution of Romanian: the
degrees of similarity between Romanian and all
the Romance languages has increased significantly
from the Chronicles period until today. Besides
them, German is the only language to which Ro-
manian drew closer (a possible explanation might
be the fact that, after the establishment of Germans

trary, the similarity between Romanian and almost
all the Slavic languages decreased in the same pe-
riod. Russian is the only Slavic language which
preserved its degree of similarity with Romanian
(being, in the 2000s, the only Slavic language
among the top 10 most closely related languages

pearance contributed to the decrease of the Slavic
influence (Ghet¸ie, 1978). In fact, all Slavic in-
fluences in the 2000s sum up to 8.9%, in con-
trast with Latin influences, reaching 61.8%. Greek
is the only language which reaches its peak re-
garding the similarity with Romanian in the 19
th
century (due to the brief Phanariot dominance in
the 19
th
century). Therefore, Romanian preserved
its Latin character all along, and the influence of
the non-Latin languages on Romanian (overesti-
mated in some works) was in fact not so signif-
icant. This fact supports Darwin’s theory (Dar-
win, 1859), which states that the genealogy of lan-
guages is consistent with the genealogy of the na-
tions (analyzed based on DNA similarity).
Orthographic Metrics. In order to compare the
similarity scores computed with the three metrics
used, we conduct hypothesis tests (Sheskin, 2003)
to determine whether the differences between the
results obtained with each metric are statistically
significant. We extract a sample of 5,000 words
and we compute the pairwise differences between
the similarity scores. Using the R v3.1.0 software
environment for statistical computing (R Core
Team, 2014), we perform the one-way ANOVA
F-test, with the null hypothesis H

are equal. Since the p-value of 2.88e-05 is much
smaller than the 0.05 significance level, we have
very strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis
that the mean computed values for the three met-
rics are all equal. Further, we perform post-hoc
comparisons applying pairwise t-tests with Bon-
feronni correction for the p-value, in order to an-
alyze the differences between the metrics. For
each pair of metrics, p ! 0.05. The differences
are statistically significant, but we notice that they
are small. Applying a two-sampled t-test, we ob-
tain a [0.012, 0.015] confidence interval for the
mean difference between EDIT and LCSR, [0.015,
0.018] for EDIT and RD, and [0.001, 0.003] for
RD and LCSR, at 95% confidence level. More-
over, computing Spearman’s rank correlation co-
efficient for the rankings obtained by each metric
for each dataset, we observe a very high corre-
lation between them (? ¡ 0.98 for each pair of
variables). Thus, we conclude that reporting the
average of the three metrics is relevant for our ex-
periments, as differences are small and do not in-
fluence the ranking.
3.2 Europarl Experiments
We continue our investigation regarding the sim-
ilarity of natural languages with two additional
experiments. First, we want to see if degrees
of similarity between Romanian and other lan-
guages in the present period are consistent across
two different corpora. In the second experi-
ment we are interested to see if there are differ-
ences between the overall degrees of similarity
obtained for the entire corpus (the bag-of-words
model) and those obtained in various experiments
at sentence level. Our main corpus is Europarl
(Koehn, 2005). More specifically, we use the por-
tions larger than 2KB collected between 2007 and
2011 from the Romanian subcorpus of Europarl.
The corpus is tokenized and sentence-aligned in
21 languages. For preprocessing this corpus, we
discard all the transcribers’ descriptions of the par-
liamentary sessions (such as “The President in-
terrupted the speaker” or “The session was sus-
pended at 19:30 and resumed at 21:00”).
Exp. #1. In a first step, we apply the methodol-
ogy described in Section 2 on the entire Europarl
corpus for Romanian, using a bag-of-words model
for the entire corpus, in which we account for the
overall frequencies of the words. In this experi-
ment, as in the previous ones, we cannot detect
outliers, i.e., sentences which are unbalanced re-
garding the etymologies of the comprised words.
For this reason, we conduct a second experiment
which addresses this potential issue.
Exp. #2. We determine sentence-level ortho-
graphic similarity and we aggregate the results to
compute the average values for the related lan-
guages. In this second experiment, we apply the
methodology described in Section 2 for each sen-
tence in the Europarl corpus for Romanian. For
each sentence we obtain a ranking of related lan-
guages and, in order to obtain a ranking of sim-
ilarity for the entire corpus, we compute the av-
erage degrees of similarity: for each related lan-
guage, we sum up the degrees of similarity for all
the sentences and divide this value by the number
of sentences in the corpus.
Exp. #3. Because the interpretation of statis-
tics derived from datasets that include outliers may
be misleading, we compute the standard quartiles
Q1, Q2 and Q3 (Sheskin, 2003) with regard to the
length of the sentences. We use the interquartile
range IQR  Q3  Q1 to find outliers in the
data. We consider outliers the observations that
fall below the lower fence LF = Q1  1.5pIQRq
or above the upper fence UF = Q3   1.5pIQRq.
We apply our methodology again only for the sen-
tences having the length in the rLF,UF s range.

language, we determine the distribution of the sen-

language (the histograms for the top 5 languages
are presented in Figure 6).
In Figure 7 we report the top 20 languages in
the ranking of similarity for Europarl, emphasiz-
ing the gain obtained by identifying cognates. In
Table 4 we report the similarity scores for the top
20 languages in the rankings of similarity for all
the 4 experiments: overall similarity for the entire
Europarl corpus (Exp. #1), sentence-level similar-
ity (Exp. #2), similarity for the sentences having
the length in the rLF,UF s range (Exp. #3), and
similarity for the sentences having the similarity
between Romanian and each related language in
the rLF,UF s range (Exp. #4).
Some remarks are immediate. We observe
that the differences between the values obtained

for the entire corpus (Exp. #1) and those ob-
tained in various experiments at sentence level
(Exp. #2 - #4) are very small (an exception is
Exp. #4, for languages whose degrees of similarity
with Romanian are of less than 10%). We test the
bag-of-words model on two corpora from the same
period (the Parliament corpus and Europarl – in
Exp. #1) and we notice that the results are consis-
tent across different corpora (0.98 Spearman’s ?).
The only significant difference is for Portuguese,
which is closer to Romanian as measured on Eu-
roparl than on the Parliament corpus.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we proposed a computational method
for determining cross-language orthographic
similarity, with application on Romanian. We
investigated etymons and cognates and we con-
ducted a fine-grained analysis of the orthographic
similarity between Romanian and related lan-
guages. Our results provide a new insight into
the classification and evolution of Romanian. We
plan to apply our similarity method on a corpus
of spoken language, and to extend our analysis
to other languages as well, as we gain access to
available resources. We further intend to combine
our orthographic approach with syntactic and
semantic evidence for a wider perspective on
language similarity.
