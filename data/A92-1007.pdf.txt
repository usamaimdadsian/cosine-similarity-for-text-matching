Abstract  
Weather reports are created in various modes - -  
natural language text, specialized language text, 
tables and maps. The system presented allows the 
user to define his needs of weather information and 
requirements on the form of presentation. The 
system analyzes a dataset obtained through spe- 
cific procedures of forecasting or observation, plans 
the product according to the user requirements 
and generates its components. Special emphasis is 
placed on the coherence of the report by investigat- 
ing the rhetorical structures observed in this kind 
of text and the coordination between a map and a 
text specifying it. The method of generation is a 
knowledge-based one with three types of knowledge 
employed in the system - terminological, rhetori- 
cal and grammatical. A prototype has been imple- 
mented and tested with original datasets. 
1 Int roduct ion  
The generation of information products stepped into 
a new phase characterized by the intensive application 
of artificial intelligence, computational linguistics and 
other modern information technologies. Currently, var- 
ious data are collected into databases and specific pro- 
cedures are applied for processing those data into fore- 
casts, analyses, surveys and other types of information 
products. Usually, those products are in numerical form 
which is unsuitable for the general audience and even 
for many specialists. Therefore this data has to be con- 
verted into a human-oriented mode such as natural lan- 
guage (NL) text, tables, maps, diagrams. The automatic 
conversion requires formalizing the process - -  a problem 
which nowadays cannot be attacked successfully except 
by gathering, coupling and employing various types of 
knowledge - -  common sense, about the subject domain, 
grammatical, etc. 
In this paper, we report on a study of the automatic 
generation of multimodal weather eports from observed 
or predicted data. This particular problem is significant 
both from a practical point of view (various weather e- 
ports are to be made every day in many weather cen- 
ters all over the world) and for its scientific aspects (it 
manifests the basic features of the generation of verbal

Education and Science and the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 
reports from data). Our work relates closely to three ar- 
eas: NL generation, multimodal documents and weather 
information processing. 
The communicative act performed by the system is the 
description of an observed or predicted situation. Other 
works that consider analogous communicative acts are 
(Davey, 1979) on the description of tic-tac-toe games, 
(Kukieh, 1983) on the generation of market reports, 
(Andr~ el al., 1988) about simultaneous commenting on 
a soccer game recorded as a sequence of digitized video 
frames. In our case the situation to be presented is coded 
into a dataset obtained through routine procedures of 
weather forecasting or observing. 
Our approach to NL generation follows the basic steps 
as described by McDonald (1987), viz. selection of the 
content portions that are to be communicated to the 
user, planning the text by adoption of the most suitable 
rhetorical schemas, realizing the discourse plan as a sur- 
face structure and its rendering as a text. The goal and 
the context of the utterance are specified by the user to- 
gether with parameters concerning the precision of the 
information and the message length. We place special 
emphasis on the content production component which 
scans the dataset and extracts assertions from it, as well 
as on the rhetorical structures observed in weather re- 
ports. 
Recently an increasing interest has been observed in 
the processing of multimodal documents, the research 
being focused on the coordination between the differ- 
ent modalities (NL, graphics, video images, pointing). 
Some projects with intensive research in this area are 
XTRA (Algayer et al., 1989), COMET (Feiner and McK- 
eown, 1990), ALFresco (Stock, 1991). To a large ex- 
tent this aspect of our project was inspired by the WIP 
project (Wahlster el al., 1991) in which the coherence of 
mUltimodal discourse is investigated and common sense 
knowledge is employed in the coordination between the 
textual and the graphical components of instructions for 
the use of domestic appliances. 
We consider the case of supplementing a weather map 
with a verbal note specifying those content portions that 
cannot be presented on the map or whose graphical pre- 
sentations distort the original information. The system 
discovers uch deficiencies of the graphical presentation 
and generates a verbal comment on the map. 
There are various projects concerning the production 
of weather reports, each of them setting specific goals 
48
The RAREAS, RAREAS-2 and FoG series of systems 
(Bourbeau et al., 1990) developed by one of the most 
successful groups in weather report generation shares 
many concepts with the current project, the main differ- 
ences lying in the specification of the product and in the 
modality of the generated ocuments. Thus the Cana- 
dian group deals exclusively with NL forecasts while our 
project considers the generation of multimodal reports 
and employs diverse means of specifying what one needs 
and in what mode he wants to receive the information. 
Our previous work (Kerpedjiev, 1990; Kerepedjiev and 
Noncheva, 1990) concerns the conversion of weather fore- 
casts from textual form to weather maps or texts in an- 
other language. This is a translation problem rather than 
a generation one. Another feature that makes the previ- 
ous work different from the current one is the lack of co- 
ordination between the graphical and the textual parts. 
Finally, in this project we employ the knowledge-based 
approach which allows a higher degree of flexibility and 
easy adoption to various types of products. 
2 Arch i tecture  of the system 
The architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. The 
initial data for the system are the dataset and a speci- 
fication of the final product prepared by the user in the 
form of a template. The system works as follows: 
1. The monitor interprets the template and succes- 
sively calls the scanner, the planner, the text or 
map generator, and the formatter with parameters 
extracted from the template. 
2. The scanner analyzes the dataset and extracts as- 
sertions about the weather situation. 
3. The planner applies rhetorical and grammatical 
knowledge to convert he extracted set of assertions 
into a surface structure or a map plan. 
4. The text generator makes use of the lexicon to lin- 
earize the surface structure into a text; the map 
generator creates a cartographical presentation from 
the map plan using the visual library. 
5. The monitor evaluates the generated text against 
parameters specified in the template (e.g. length of 
the text), and if the result does not meet the require- 
ments of the user, re-activates the previous proces- 
sors with adjusted parameters for providing alterna- 
tive solutions. 
6. The formatter assembles the product.

In this section we describe the initial dataset, the asser- 
tions extracted from the dataset, and the form of the 
final product as well as its specification.

form with lines corresponding to the locations, columns 
- -  to the weather elements considered in the report, and 
subcolumns - -  to the time instants to which the data 
refer. The locations are either the stations where data 
is collected or the nodes of a regular grid in which the 
numerical forecast is computed. 
In our experiments we used weather data collected 
through observations made at the main synoptic hours 
(00, 06, 12, 18 GMT) in 50 weather stations dispersed 
over the territory of Bulgaria. Ten weather elements have 
been considered: cloud amount, precipitation type and 
amount, wind speed and direction, min and max tem- 
peratures, and the phenomena fog, frost, thunderstorm. 
3 .2  In termed iary  representat ion  
An intermediary representation is necessary because the 
initial dataset describes the weather in terms of a scien- 
tifically based model which may not meet the user con- 
ceptions. It is intended to accommodate in a language 
independent form those facts that will be conveyed to 
the user. 
What are the major differences between the initial 
data and the intermediary representation? Firstly, they 
pertain to different erritory and time models• While the 
locations in a dataset are weather stations or grid nodes, 
in the intermediary representation they are administra- 
tive and geographic areas known to the audience. The 
dataset contains data referring to time instants, whereas 
the facts of the intermediary representation refer to parts 
of the day (such as morning) and whole days. Hence, the 
facts in the intermediary representation summarize the 
initial data with respect o time and space• 
The second difference concerns the weather models. In 
addition to the basic weather elements employed in the 
49
initial dataset, the intermediary representation makes 
use of some derived attributes. So, the basic numerical 
quantities wind speed and precipitation amount are con- 
verted into qualitative characteristics - - wind strength 
and precipitation intensity, respectively. Particular ex- 
amples of other derived attributes are given in section 4. 
We call the facts from the intermediary representation 
assertions and denote them as quintuples: 
( w_attribut e, w_value, region, period, precision). 
The weather attribute and the weather value represent 
the goal of the assertion; the region and the time period 
form its context; the last component denotes the preci- 
sion of the summarization both over time and space and 
in the case of facts with derived weather attributes. 
3.3 Structure of the final product 
The final product is a natural or specialized language 
text, a table 1 and/or graphics. The basic constructs of 
those modes are oriented towards the expression of as- 
sertions - -  the atomic content portions extracted from 
the dataset. A NL sentence or clause, an icon placed in 
a certain position on the map, and a lexical or numerical 
weather value put in a cell of the weather table are all 
constructs of this type. 
Figure 2 illustrates some modes. For example, the 
assertion (cloud_amount, overcast, Nor_Bul, morn, high) 
expressible through the NL sentence "In the morning it 
will be cloudy over North Bulgaria" is represented as a 
weather map (Figure 2d) and in the upper left cell of 
the weather table in Figure 2c. Weather eports can be 
structured in different ways. The text in Figure 2b is an 
enumeration type of text with four independent segments 
labeled by the regions they pertain to, and the text in 
Figure 2a is a sample of a narrative text. 
3.4 Specif icat ion of the final product 
The user's requirements on the final product are speci- 
fied by means of a template. It defines the mode, goal 
and context of the product, as well as various parameters 
concerning the precision of the information, the length of 
the message, and the style of text or map. The template 
consists of two types of statements: tatements defining 
the modal structure of the document and content pro- 
duction statements. 
There are four statements defining the modal struc- 
ture of the final product: narration, enumeration, table 
and picture. The general format of a modal structure 
statement is given below: 
<modal_struct _st at ement>{<external_context>} 
<s equence_o~_content_product ion star ement s>. 
The following examples of statements are intended to 
generate a product with the modal and content structure 
of the forecast in Figure 2. 
1 We should istinguish the standard tabular eport representing 
the initial dataset from the user tables.

Bul, whole_day ; precision=O. 6} ;

value{clouds ; morn} ; value{clouds ; noon} ; 
value{clouds ; aftern} ; value{clouds ; even} ; 
picture{Nor_Bul, morn} 
map{clouds ; ; maxasrt=2} 
The content production statements are value, text an. 
map. The first type of statement produces the lexice 
presentation of a single weather value (e.g. overcast, c 
15°C); the text production statement makes complet 
sentences linked in a coherent text; and the map produc 
tion statement generates a cartographical presentation ( 
the assertions by placing icons of the particular weathe 
values in certain positions of the map. The format of 
content production statement is as follows: 
<content_production_statement> 
{<goal>; <context>; <parameters>} 
The goal is the set of weather attributes in which th 
user is interested. The context contains the region an 
the time period for which weather information shoul 
be extracted. The part of the context given as an e) 
ternal context in the modal structure statement make 
a heading of the corresponding section, and therefor( 
this context may not be explicitly mentioned in the rex 
The parameters specifying the produced content portio 
are divided into three groups: precision rate, length an 
style of the message. 
The precision parameter defines the minimum prec 
sion rate that must be guaranteed by the generated me~ 
sage. By specifying a high precision value, we rule ot 
vague sentences like "it will be cloudy in some portior 
of North Bulgaria" and force the system to retrieve mol 
precise assertions from the dataset. 
The parameters restricting the length of the messa~ 
are of three types: 
• maxasrt - determines the maximum number of 
sertions generated for each attribute from the goa 
• length - restricts the length of the final text by spe, 
ifying the minimum and maximum number of cha 
acters in it (applies to text production only); 
• detail - specifies the level of detail of the pr( 
duced message on a three-element qualitative sca: 
{concise, normal, full}; concise detail implies th~ 
only a summary information for each goal should k 
extracted; full detail makes the system extract con 
plete information; and normal detail produces a te) 
with a level of detail in between the two extremes

the case of map production, the style determines what 
types of icons should be used and how the time will be 
presented (through several maps, by explicitly indicating 
the time periods on the map, etc.). For reference pur- 
poses, each style is given a unique identifier, e.g. english, 
telegr-bul-report, avionic. 
4 Terminological knowledge 
The terminological knowledge-base (TKB) represents 
the weather, territory and time models. 
The weather model consists of the set of weather at- 
tributes, their domains, relations between some domains, 
and rules for calculation of derived attributes. So the 
qualitative weather element wind strength with a five- 
element ordered domain is calculated from the numerical 
basic attr ibute wind speed by means of the rule: 
calm if w_speed E \[0, 2\] 
light if w_speed E \[3, 6\] 
w_strength = moderate if w_speed E \[7, 14\] 
strong if w_speed E \[15, 20\] 
gale if w_speed > 20 
The derived weather attr ibute cloud change with a four- 
element nominal scale is calculated by means of a rule 
based on the properties mouotonicity and amplitude of 
the basic attr ibute cloud amount with a three-element 
ordered scale {clear, partly_cloudy, overcast}. Similar 
rules allow the system to calculate summary weather 
attributes. For example, the clouds attr ibute unifies 
the domains of the attributes cloud amount and cloud 
change into the domain {clear, partly_cloudy, overcast, 
clouds_increase, clouds_decrease, variable}. 
Two weather values Vl and v2 are considered related if 
they represent co-occurring weather characteristics (e.g. 
overcast and rain) and opposite if the characteristics are 
associated as contrary (e.g. clear and overcast). The 
two relations are defined in the TKB by means of the 
predicates related(v1, v2) and opposite(v1, v2). 
The territory model represents the set of regions, their 
carriers and certain logical links between them. The 
function carrier(r) returns the set of stations that be- 
long to r, thereby allowing us to treat the regions as 
sets. The predicate path(rl,r2,...,r,~) indicates that 
there is a path starting from region rl,  passing through 
r2, . . . ,  r,~_l, and reaching rn. 
The time model defines the time periods as inter- 
vals of time instants through the functions begin(t) and 
end(t). Two relations between time periods supported 
by the TKB are partial order (tt < t2 iff end(tl) ~_ 
begin(t2)) and inclusion (tl C t2 iff \[begin(tl), end(t1)\] C 
\[begin(t2), end(t 2)\])- 
The relations between weather values, regions and 
time periods are employed in the selection of rhetorical 
schemas (cf. section 6).

5 Scanning the dataset 
The scanner determines the content portions of the mes- 
sage by computing relevant assertions from the dataset. 
The monitor calls it with two types of queries specifying 
the goal (a single weather attribute), the context and 
a parameter concerning either the precision rate or the 
maximum number of assertions to be produced: 
scanp(clouds, Bul, whole day, 0.8) 
scana(clouds, Bul, whole_day, 3) 
The first query makes the scanner extract assertions 
about the clouds attribute applied to Bulgaria and the 
whole day, and with a precision rate greater than or equal 
to 0.8. The second query restricts the maximum number 
of assertions that should be extracted to three. 
The scanning is carried out in three steps: generation 
of a full set of assertions, pruning the full set of assertions 
and selection of the final set of assertions. 
In the first step, the scanner applies weather verifica- 
tion techniques (Kerpedjiev and Ivanov, 1991) to gen- 
erate an assertion for each context that belongs to the 
query context. Such an assertion contains the weather 
value that approximates the data subset corresponding 
to that context with the highest precision rate. 
In order to avoid a combinatorial explosion during the 
selection, the set of assertions is pruned by removing all 
assertions that can be inferred from other assertions. (An 
assertion aa can be inferred from a2 if both assertions 
convey the same weather value, but aa relates to a sub- 
context of a2 and its precision rate does not excede that 
of a~.) The average reduction rate of the pruning is 70%. 
The selection of a combination of assertions is first 
made independently for each weather value of the goal at- 
tribute. A combination of two assertions (w, v, rl, t l ,p l )  
and (w, v, r2, t2, P2) is evaluated by means of the formula 
min(pl,p2, 1 -p~, 1 -p" )  where p' and p" are the pre- 
cision rates of the assertions (w, v, r - rl - r2, t ,p ~) and 
(w, v, rl-q-r2, t--t l  --t2, p"), respectively, r and t being the 
query context. Then the scanner selects the most precise 
combinations for the different weather values and returns 
them as a response to the query. 
6 P lanning the report 
The planner assimilates a set of assertions into a surface 
text structure or a map plan. Since planning is essen- 
tially a process of arranging the information in a coherent 
way, we will consider at first the coherence in weather e- 
ports and then will elaborate the planning techniques. 
6 .1  Coherence  
Coherence can be ensured for the portions created only 
by the text production and map production statements 
since the modal structure statements combine the con- 
stituent parts mechanically without caring for the con- 
sistency between them. 
Coherence of a text portion is achieved by selecting a 
rhetorical schema that suits best the current set of asser- 
tions. The main vehicle for ensuring proper organization 
of the text content is the employment of existing rela- 
tions in the TKB. Indeed, those links represent common 
associations and orderings of the objects, and following 
any of them while reading or hearing the text will en- 
able the user to assimilate the information easily with 
minimum cognitive effort. 
Based on the analysis of a number of textual weather 
forecasts and reports, we have extracted and collected 
seven types of rhetorical schemas: 
Presentation by weather attributes. An assertion about 
a given attribute cannot interpose a sequence of as- 
sertions concerning another attribute. 
From a summary to details. An assertion with a context 
which includes the context of another assertion is 
conveyed before the second assertion. 
Temporal progression. The assertions are ordered by the 
successive time intervals they pertain to. 
Spatial progression. The assertions are arranged in such 
a way that their regions form a conceptually existing 
path. 
Coupling related values. Assertions with related values 
and intersecting contexts are rendered in a group. 
Contrast. Two assertions with opposite values are con- 
veyed together to contrast with each other. 
Presentation by weather values. The assertions about 
given attribute with an ordered domain are con- 
veyed in successive groups relating to the particulal 
weather values. 
The problem of supplementing a graphical portior 
(created by the map production statement) with aver  
bal comment may arise when the situation presented oi 
the map is dynamic, imprecise or uncertain. Due to th( 
lack of proper graphical means of expression for suct 
properties, a text has tobe  created that specifies the in 
formation available on the map. The following exampl, 
illustrates the problem. 
Suppose that the assertion (phen, fog, Nor_Bul, morn 
high) has to be shown on a map created for the whol, 
day. A presentation with the pictograph for fog place( 
in one or more positions dispersed uniformly over th, 
region specified may prove misleading because the im 
portant information about the time period is absent. T, 
resume the correctness of the map the following concis 
text message should be created: 
"The fog in North Bulgaria will clear by noon." 
It consists of the reference part "the fog in North Bu\] 
garia" and the specification part "will clear by noon" 
The reference part identifies the phenomenon throug 
elements expressed on tile map while the specificatio 
part conveys the missing or distorted elements. 
52
6.2 Text  p lann ing  
The conversion of a set of assertions into a surface struc- 
ture poses two main problems: 
• How to find the most suitable rhetorical structure 
of the text? 
• How to realize this structure into the surface struc- 
ture of cohesive sentences? 
We employed rhetorical and grammatical knowledge m- 
bedded in rules to cope with those problems. For each 
rhetorical schema, a rule is formulated whose condition 
part evaluates how well the set of assertions is stratified 
by the corresponding schema. For example, we regard 
a set of assertions as well stratified by a path of regions 
if all assertions pertain to the same attribute and time 
period and there exists a one-to-one correspondence b - 
tween the regions of the path and the regions of the as- 
sertions, or a set of assertions is well stratified chrono- 
logically if all assertions pertain to the same region and 
there is no overlap between their time periods. 
Since the conditions of the "temporal progression" 
and "spatial progression" rhetorical schemas as described 
above are too rigid and so they are rarely satisfied by the 
assertions produced by the scanner, we loosened them by 
allowing partial instead of full coincidence between the 
regions. The grade of similarity between two regions rl 
and r~ is defined by the formula: 
learrier(r~ ) n carrier( r~)l 
d( r l ,  = 1 - u 
and they are considered coincident if d(rl, r2) > 0.7. 
Thus the set of three assertions concerning the regions 
"the lowlands of West Bulgaria", "Central Bulgaria" and 
"the Black sea coast" can be successfully mapped out 
along the path "West Bulgaria", "Central Bulgaria", 
"East Bulgaria". 
There are certain priorities among the rhetorical 
schemas. The schemas "presentation by attributes" and 
"coupling related values" have priority over the others; 
the schema "from a summary to details" has priority over 
the temporal and spatial progressions, etc. A rule with 
a higher priority than another is applied first, and only 
if it fails, then the second rule is tried. 
The action part of the chosen rule breaks the set of 
assertions into a chain of chunks. The link between 
two chunks represents the conversational move that takes 
place when the discourse passes from the source to the 
target chunk. Then each chunk is broken down into a 
subchain, and so on until a hierarchical discourse struc- 
ture is obtained, at the terminal nodes of which are the 
assertions of the initial set (cf. Figure 3b). 
The conversion into a surface structure proceeds by 
applying the rules embedding the grammatical knowl- 
edge. They analyze the discourse structure by means of 
patterns. The matching of a pattern with a discourse 
substructure l ads to a transformation of the latter into 
the surface structure of a sentence, clause or phrase and 
its bounding to the surface structure of the text. In 
addition to indicators of the elements of the discourse 
structure, the patterns may contain conditions on the 
contents of the assertions and on the types of the preced- 
ing sentences. Figure 3c shows a portion of the surface 
structure realizing the discourse structure in Figure 3b. 
The following features characterize the creation of the 
surface structure of a text: 
• A good deal of sentences are constructed on the ba- 
sis of impersonal verb phrases typical for weather 
description. 
• The tense of the verbs is determined by the type of 
the report. If it is a forecast, then future tense is 
adopted, otherwise - -  past tense. 
• Where appropriate, function words are inserted that 
indicate the type of conversational move (e.g. "but" 
for contrast, "also" for addition, etc.). 
• Certain elements of the context (the region and/or 
the time period) are omitted, if implied from the 
preceding text or the external context, or are re- 
placed by adverbial or relative adverbial phrases 
("there, then, where, when"), if the corresponding 
element is implied but the grammatical structure 
requires uch a phrase. 
• The precision rate of the assertions, if lower than 
high, is indicated by inserting proper modifiers, such 
as "at many places of ...", "mostly" etc., which 
warn the reader to accept he information with some 
reservations. 
• The word order of the sentences i  selected in such 
a way that the elements constituting the topics and 
the focuses of the consecutive sentences alternate 
(Haji~ov£, 1987). For example, if the region is the 
focus of one sentence, it is good to generate the next 
sentence with the region being its topic. Thus the 
text will flow rhythmically and at a proper pace. 
6.3 Supp lement ing  a map wi th  a text  
A technique of converting a set of assertions into a 
weather map has been described in (Kerpedjiev, 1990). 
Here we concisely recall the technique and extend it to 
allow the generation of text supplements. 
The conversion of a set of assertion into a map is based 
on the existence of a set of visual objects (pictographs) 
and two functions - -  f and g; f assigns a pictigraph 
to each weather value; and g, for each region, deter- 
mines the positions where the icons related to a given 
attribute should be put in. The algorithm of conver- 
sion scans the selected set of assertions and generates tile 
map plan by replacing each assertion (w, v, r, t,p) with 
a list of statements {(q, xi, yi)}i=l..,~, where q = f(t'). 
{(xi, yi)}i=l n = g(w,r).  A statement (q,x,y) of the 
map plan drives the formatter to place icon q in the po- 
sition with coordinates (x, y). 
Some problems arise with this technique. Firstly. two 
pictographs may occur to overlap and distort each other.

Secondly, certain geometrical relations between the icons 
of related assertions hould be ensured. Thirdly, the in- 
formation concerning the time period and the precision 
rate is completely ignored by the conversion technique. 
The first two problems are resolved by carefully designing 
the function g. Information about a time period and/or 
precision rate, when necessary, is provided by a verbal 
comment as described below. 
Suppose that the assertion (w, v, r , t ,p)  is visualized 
on a map representing the weather situation in context 
(r',ff). The corresponding map plan will represent the 
assertion correctly only if t' C t and p = high. If any 
of these relations is violated then the system has to im- 
part this information to the user. We call it residual 
information or a residue. It consists of a reference part 
determined by the weather value (the user associates it
with the corresponding icon) and possibly by the region 
(if r f'l r ' # / ;  the user should identify it with the lo- 
cations where the icons are situated) and a specificalion 
part determined by the elements t'f'lt (if different from t ') 
and p (if not high). The grammar for rendering a residue 
as a sentence is available in the grammatical knowledge 
base. Furthurmore, the residual information can be for- 
mulated either as a characteristics of the reference part 
(e.g. "the rain in East Bulgaria will be scattered") or as 
a process (e.g. "the rain in East Bulgaria will stop by 
noon" ). 
The planning of a text supplement may face the fol- 
lowing problem. Consider the example in section 6.1. If 
another assertion occurs about a fog in North Bulgaria 
at noon, then the residual information must be adjustec 
to the following message: 
"The fog in North Bulgaria will clear by the 
afternoon" 
In order to avoid any inconsistency in the generated mes. 
sage, the system collects the residues relating to the sam~ 
weather attribute and region, unifies their specificatio~ 
parts whereby some content portions may partially neu 
tralize each other, and then generates the message. 
7 Generation and composition 
The text generator converts the surface structure into 
text by making use of the phrasal lexicon. For some o 
the terminals of the surface structure it provides ready. 
made strings, while other terminals have to be refine( 
further. For example, if the regions "South Bulgaria' 
and "East Bulgaria" occur in the same phrase, the gener. 
ator will combine them into the contracted form "Soutt 
and East Bulgaria". Whenever possible, the text gener. 
ator takes care of the diversity of lexical forms by pro 
viding different phrases for terminal nodes of the sam~ 
type (compare "much of Bulgaria" and "most areas" ii 
the example in Figure 3). 
The map generator interprets the map plan and con 
verts it into an image by rendering the successive state 
ments (cf. section 6.3). The maps contours as well as th~ 
various icons are prepared in advance and stored in th~ 
visual library. The text supplements, if any, are prepare¢ 
in the same way as ordinary text portions and attache¢ 
to the bottom of the map. 
54
The formatter composes the document from compo- 
nents delivered by the generators. An enumeration struc- 
ture is created from the constituting text portions by 
inserting the lexical representation f each external con- 
text as a heading of the corresponding portion. A table 
is composed of phrases produced by the text generator 
from a series of values extracted by the scanner. 
8 Conc lus ion  
The system presented in this paper interprets a weather 
dataset and generates a multimodal report. The follow- 
ing features distinguish the method from similar projects 
carried out elsewhere: 
• Various weather documents have been analyzed to 
determine their structures and to define a language 
that allows the user to specify the generated prod- 
uct with respect o mode, content, style, length and 
precision of the information. 
• A knowledge-based technique for selection of the dis- 
course structure of the generated document has been 
devised on the basis of typical rhetorical schemas 
and relations defined in the TKB. 
• The system controls the precision of the assertions 
extracted. Information with a low precision rate is 
rendered as a sentence with lexical indicators of im- 
precision (e.g. in some portions, possibly), which 
warn the user to accept he corresponding assertions 
with a certain degree of reservation. 
• The cartographical presentation, though superior in 
many respects to the textual presentation, still suf- 
fers from the lack of proper means of expression for 
certain elements such as time and precision of the in- 
formation. Therefore, a map may he supplemented 
with a concise verbal comment on the underspec- 
ified elements. Thus the two modalities, NL and 
graphics, complementing each other offer a highly 
expressive and efficient weather eport. 
The system has been implemented in Pascal on an IBM 
PC. The TKB is filled in with models of the general- 
purpose short-range weather forecasts for Bulgaria. The 
grammatical knowledge base and the lexicon contain 
styles corresponding to subsets of Bulgarian and English. 
Experiments have been performed with datasets com- 
piled at the National Weather Service in Sofia. 
In order to make the system practical it has to be 
coupled with a layout manager. Thus the user will be 
able to specify the arrangement of the different units in 
the plane. 
Another point of future work is the enrichment of the 
weather model with attributes ummarizing the weather 
over a longer period (say five days) taking into account 
climatic data. Thus the system will be able to extract 
and render more interesting facts about the weather. 
A promising research area which may contribute to 
the further development of the system is user modeling. 
Experimentation i  this area can be combined with the 
various applications of weather eports.
