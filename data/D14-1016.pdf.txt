Abstract
We present a novel approach to im-
prove word alignment for statistical ma-
chine translation (SMT). Conventional
word alignment methods allow discontin-
uous alignment, meaning that a source
(or target) word links to several target (or
source) words whose positions are dis-
continuous. However, we cannot extrac-
t phrase pairs from this kind of align-
ments as they break the alignment con-
sistency constraint. In this paper, we use
a weighted vote method to transform dis-
continuous word alignment to continuous
alignment, which enables SMT system-
s extract more phrase pairs. We carry
out experiments on large scale Chinese-
to-English and German-to-English trans-
lation tasks. Experimental results show
statistically significant improvements of
BLEU score in both cases over the base-
line systems. Our method produces a gain
of +1.68 BLEU on NIST OpenMT04 for
the phrase-based system, and a gain of
+1.28 BLEU on NIST OpenMT06 for the
hierarchical phrase-based system.
1 Introduction
Word alignment, indicating the correspondence
between the source and target words in bilingual
sentences, plays an important role in statistical
machine translation (SMT). Almost all of the SMT
models, not only phrase-based (Koehn et al.,
2003), but also syntax-based (Chiang, 2005; Liu
et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2006), derive translation
knowledge from large amount bilingual text anno-
tated with word alignment. Therefore, the quality
of the word alignment has big impact on the qual-
ity of translation output.
Word alignments are usually automatically ob-
tained from a large amount of bilingual training
corpus. The most widely used toolkit for word
alignment in SMT community is GIZA++ (Och
and Ney, 2004), which implements the well known
IBM models (Brown et al., 1993) and the HM-
M model (Vogel and Ney, 1996). Koehn et al.
(2003) proposed some heuristic methods (e.g. the
“grow-diag-final” method) to refine word align-
ments trained by GIZA++. Another group of word
alignment methods (Liu et al., 2005; Moore et
al., 2006; Riesa and Marcu, 2010) define feature
functions to describe word alignment. They need
manually aligned bilingual texts to train the mod-
el. However, the manually annotated data is too
expensive to be available for all languages. Al-
though these models reported high accuracy, the
GIZA++ and “grow-diag-final” method are domi-
nant in practice.
However, automatic word alignments are usu-
ally very noisy. The example in Figure 1 shows
a Chinese and English sentence pair, with word
alignment automatically trained by GIZA++ and
the “grow-diag-final” method. We find many er-
rors (dashed links) are caused by discontinuous
alignment (formal definition is described in Sec-
tion 2), a source (or target) word linking to sev-
eral discontinuous target (or source) words. This
kind of errors will result in the loss of many use-
ful phrase pairs that are learned based on bilingual
word alignment. Actually, according to the defini-
tion of phrases in a standard phrase-based model,
we cannot extract phrases from the discontinuous
alignment. The reason is that this kind of align-
ment break the alignment consistency constrain-
t (Koehn et al., 2003). For example, the Chi-

nese word “shi

”

is aligned to the English words
“was
4
” and “that
10
”. However, these two English
words are discontinuous, and we cannot extract the
phrase pair “(shi, was)”.
In this paper, we propose a simple weighed vote
method to deal with the discontinuous word align-
ment. Firstly, we split the discontinuous align-
ment into several continuous alignment group-
s, and consider each continuous alignment group
as a bucket. Secondly, we vote for each buck-
et with alignment score measured by word trans-
lation probabilities. Finally, we select the buck-
et with the highest score as the final alignment.
The strength of our method is that we refine word
alignment without using any external knowledge,
as the word translation probabilities can be esti-
mated from the bilingual corpus with the original
word alignment.
We notice that the discontinuous alignment is
helpful for hierarchical phrase-based model, as the
model allows discontinuous phrases. Thus, for
the hierarchical phrase-based model, our method
may lost some discontinuous phrases. To solve
the problem, we keep the original discontinuous
alignment in the training corpus.
We carry out experiment with the state-of-the-
art phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based
(Chiang, 2005) SMT systems implemented in
Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). Experiments on large
scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English
translation tasks demonstrate significant improve-
ments in both cases over the baseline systems.
2 The Weighted Vote Method
To refine the discontinuous alignment, we propose
a weighted vote method to transform discontinu-
ous alignment to continuous alignment by discard-
ing noisy links. We split discontinuous alignment
1
The subscript denotes the word position.
into several continuous groups, and select the best
group with the highest score computed by word
translation probabilities as the final alignment.
For further understanding, we first describe
some definitions. Given a word-aligned sentence
pair (F
I
1
, E
J
1
, A), an alignment set A
set
(i) is the
set of target word positions that aligned to the
source word F
i
i
:
A
set
(i) = {j|(i, j) ? A} (1)
For example, in Figure 1, the alignment set
for the Chinese word “shaoshu
3
” is A
set
(3) =
{5, 7, 8, 10}. We define an alignment s-
pan A
span
(i) as [min(A
set
(i)),max(A
set
(i))].
Thus, the alignment span for the Chinese word
“shaoshu
3
” is A
span
(3) = [5, 10].
The alignment for F
i
i
is discontinuous if there
exist some target words in A
span
(i) linking to an-
other source word, i.e. ?(i
?
, j
?
) ? A, where i
?
6= i,
j
?
? A
span
(i). Otherwise, the alignment is contin-
uous. According to the definition, the alignment
for “shaoshu
3
” is discontinuous. Because the tar-
get words “the
6
” and “nations
9
” in the alignmen-
t span link to another Chinese words “de
9
” and
“guojia
10
”, respectively. For a target word E
j
j
, the
definition is similar.
If the alignment for F
i
i
is discontinuous, we
can split the alignment span A
span
(i) = [j
1
, j
2
]
into m continuous spans {[j
k
p
, j
k

]}, where k =
1, 2, ...,m, and j
k
p
, j
k
q
? [j
1
, j
2
]. Our goal is to se-
lect the best continuous span for the word F
i
i
. To
do this, we score each continuous span with word
translation probabilities:
S([j
k
p
, j
k

]) =
q

(Pr(E

The word translation probabilities can be comput-
ed from the bilingual corpus with the initial word
alignment. Finally, we select the span with the
highest score as the final alignment, and discard
all other alignments.
We illustrate our method in Figure 2, which
shows the source word “shaoshu” and its align-
ment in Figure 1. We split the alignments into
three continuous alignment spans and compute s-
core for each span. Finally, the span with highest
score (heavy shading area) is selected as the final
alignment.
We conduct the procedure for each source and
target word, the improved alignment (solid links)
is shown in Figure 1.
3 Experiment
To demonstrate the effect of the proposed method,
we use the state-of-the-art phrase-based system
and hierarchical phrase-based system implement-
ed in Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). The phrase-
based system uses continuous phrase pair as the
main translation knowledge. While the hierarchi-
cal phrase-based system uses both continuous and
discontinuous phrase pairs, which has an ability to
capture long distance phrase reordering.
we carried out experiments on two translation
tasks: the Chinese-to-English task comes from the
NIST Open MT Evaluation, and the German-to-
English task comes from the Workshop on Ma-
chine Translation (WMT) shared task.
3.1 Training
The training data we used are listed in Table 1. For
the Chinese-English task, the bilingual data are s-
elected from LDC. We used NIST MT03 as the
development set and tested our system on NIST
MT evaluation sets from 2004 to 2008. For the
German-English task, the bilingual data are from

the shared translation task 2013. We used WMT08
as the development set and tested our system on
WMT test sets from 2010 to 2013.
The baseline systems are trained on the training
corpus with initial word alignment, which was ob-
tained via GIZA++ and “grow-diag-final” method.
Based on the initial word alignment, we comput-
ed word translation probabilities and used the pro-
posed method to obtain a refined word alignment.
Then we used the refined word alignment to train
our SMT systems.
The translation results are evaluated by case-
insensitive BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002).
The feature weights of the translation system
are tuned with the standard minimum-error-rate-
training (Och, 2003) to maximize the systems
BLEU score on the development set.
3.2 Results
3.2.1 Phrase-based System
Table 2 shows Chinese-to-English translation
quality of the phrase-based system. We ob-
served that our refined method significantly out-
performed the baseline word alignment on all test
sets. The improvements are ranged from 0.97 to
1.68 BLEU%.
Table 3 shows German-to-English translation
quality of the phrase-based system. The improve-
ments are ranged from 0.51 to 0.75 BLEU%.
These results demonstrate that the proposed
method improves the translation quality for

phrase-based system. The reason is that by dis-
carding noisy word alignments from the discon-
tinuous alignments, the phrase pairs constrained
by the noisy alignments can be extracted. Thus the
system utilized more phrase pairs than the baseline
did.
3.2.2 Hierarchical Phrase-based System
The hierarchical phrase-based system utilizes dis-
continuous phrase pairs for long distance phrase
reordering. Some of the discontinuous phrase
pairs are extracted from the discontinuous align-
ments. By transforming the discontinuous align-
ments to continuous alignments, on the one hand,
we may lost some discontinuous phrase pairs. On
the other hand, we may extract additional contin-
uous and discontinuous phrase pairs as the align-
ment restriction is loose.
See Figure 3 for illustration. From the initial
alignment, we can extract a hierarchical phrase
pair “(dang X
1
shi, when X
1
)” from the discon-
tinuous alignment of the English word “when”.
However, the hierarchical phrase pair cannot be
extracted from our refined alignment, because our
method discards the link between the Chinese
word “dang” and the English word “when”. In-
stead, we can extract another hierarchical phrase
pair “(X
1
shi, when X
1
)”.
Does our method still obtain improvements on
the hierarchical phrase-based system? Table 4 and
Table 5 shows Chinese-to-English and German-
to-English translation quality of the hierarchical
phrase-based system, respectively. For Chinese-
to-English translation, the refined alignment ob-
tained improvements ranged from 0.07 to 0.58

BLEU% on the test set ( the row “Refined”).
While for German-to-English translation, the im-
provements ranged from 0.12 to 0.59 BLEU% on
the test set (the row “Refined”).
We find that the improvements are less than
that of the phrase-based system. As discussed
above, our method may lost some hierarchical
phrase pairs that extracted from the discontinuous
alignments. To solve the problem, we combine
2
the initial alignments and the refined alignments
to train the SMT system. The results are shown
in the row “Combined” in Table 4 and Table 5.
For Chinese-to-English translation, we obtained
an improvements of 1.28 BLEU% on NIST06 over
the baseline. While for German-to-English trans-
lation, the greatest improvements is 1.10 BLEU%
on WMT11.
4 Analyses
In order to further study the performance of the
proposed method, we analyze the word alignment
and the phrase table for Chinese-to-English trans-
lation. We find that our method improves the qual-
ity of word alignment. And as a result, more useful
phrase pairs are extracted from the refined word
alignment.
4.1 Word Alignment
The Chinese-to-English training corpus contains
4.5M sentence pairs. By applying GIZA++ and
the “grow-diag-final” method, we obtained initial
alignments. We find that 4.0M (accounting for
89%) sentence pairs contain discontinuous align-
ments. We then used the proposed method to dis-
card noisy links. By doing this, the total links
between words in the training corpus are reduced
from 99.6M to 78.9M, indicating that 21% links
are discarded.
2
We do not perform combination for phrase-based sys-
tem, because the phrase table extracted from the initial align-
ment is a subset of that extracted from the refined alignment.

initial and refined alignment for the hierarchical

lation. StandPhr is standard phrase, HierPhr is hi-
erarchical phrase.
We evaluated the alignment quality on 200 sen-
tence pairs. Results are shown in Table 6. It is
observed that our method improves the precision
and decreases the AER, while keeping a high re-
call. This means that our method effectively dis-
cards noisy links in the initial word alignments.
4.2 Phrase Table
According to the standard definition of phrase in
SMT, phrase pairs cannot be extracted from the
discontinuous alignments. By transforming dis-
continuous alignments into continuous alignmen-
t, we can extract more phrase pairs. Table 7
shows the number of standard phrases and hier-
archical phrases extracted from the initial and re-
fined word alignments. We find that the number of
both phrases and hierarchical phrases grows heav-
ily. This is because that the word alignment con-
straint for phrase extraction is loosed by removing
noisy links. Although the phrase table becomes
larger, fortunately, there are some methods (John-
son et al., 2007; He et al., 2009) to prune phrase
table without hurting translation quality.
For further illustration, we compare the phrase
pairs extracted from the initial alignment and re-
fined alignment in Figure 1. From the initial align-
ments, we extracted only 3 standard phrase pairs
and no hierarchical phrase pairs (Table 8). After
discarding noisy alignments (dashed links) by us-
ing the proposed method, we extracted 21 standard
phrase pairs and 36 hierarchical phrases. Table 9
and Table 10 show selected phrase pairs and hier-
archical phrase pairs, respectively.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we proposed a novel method to im-
prove word alignment for SMT. The method re-
fines initial word alignments by transforming dis-
continuous alignment to continuous alignment. As
a result, more useful phrase pairs are extracted
from the refined word alignment. Our method is
simple and efficient, since it uses only the word
translation probabilities obtained from the initial
alignments to discard noisy links. Our method
is independent of languages and can be applied
to most SMT models. Experimental results show
significantly improvements for the state-of-the-art
phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based sys-
tems on all Chinese-to-English and German-to-
English translation tasks.
In the future, we will refine the method by con-
sidering neighbor words and alignments when dis-
carding noisy links.
