Abstract 
To overcome the scarceness of bilingual 
corpora for some language pairs in ma-
chine translation, pivot-based SMT uses 
pivot language as a "bridge" to generate 
source-target translation from source-
pivot and pivot-target translation. One of 
the key issues is to estimate the probabili-
ties for the generated phrase pairs. In this 
paper, we present a novel approach to 
calculate the translation probability by 
pivoting the co-occurrence count of 
source-pivot and pivot-target phrase pairs. 
Experimental results on Europarl data 
and web data show that our method leads 
to significant improvements over the 
baseline systems. 
1 Introduction 
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) relies on 
large bilingual parallel data to produce high qual-
ity translation results. Unfortunately, for some 
language pairs, large bilingual corpora are not 
readily available. To alleviate the parallel data 
scarceness, a conventional solution is to intro-
duce a “bridge” language (named pivot language) 
to connect the source and target language (de 
Gispert and Marino, 2006; Utiyama and Isahara, 
2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; 
Paul et al., 2011; El Kholy et al., 2013; Zahabi et 
al., 2013), where there are large amounts of 
source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora. 
Among various pivot-based approaches, the 
triangulation method (Cohn and Lapata, 2007; 
Wu and Wang, 2007) is a representative work in 
pivot-based machine translation. The approach 
proposes to build a source-target phrase table by 
merging the source-pivot and pivot-target phrase 
table. One of the key issues in this method is to 
estimate the translation probabilities for the gen-
erated source-target phrase pairs. Conventionally, 
the probabilities are estimated by multiplying the 
posterior probabilities of source-pivot and pivot-
target phrase pairs. However, it has been shown 
that the generated probabilities are not accurate 
enough (Cui et al., 2013). One possible reason 
may lie in the non-uniformity of the probability 
space. Through Figure 1. (a), we can see that the 
probability distributions of source-pivot and piv-
ot-target language are calculated separately, and 
the source-target probability distributions are 
induced from the source-pivot and pivot-target 
probability distributions. Because of the absence 
of the pivot language (e.g., p2 is in source-pivot 
probability space but not in pivot-target one), the 
induced source-target probability distribution is 
not complete, which will result in inaccurate 
probabilities.  
To solve this problem, we propose a novel ap-
proach that utilizes the co-occurrence count of 
source-target phrase pairs to estimate phrase 
translation probabilities more precisely. Different 
from the triangulation method, which merges the 
source-pivot and pivot-target phrase pairs after 
training the translation model, we propose to 
merge the source-pivot and pivot-target phrase 
pairs immediately after the phrase extraction step, 
and estimate the co-occurrence count of the 
source-pivot-target phrase pairs. Finally, we 
compute the translation probabilities according 
to the estimated co-occurrence counts, using the 
standard training method in phrase-based SMT 
(Koehn et al., 2003). As Figure 1. (b) shows, the 
1665
source-target probability distributions are calcu-
lated in a complete probability space. Thus, it 
will be more accurate than the traditional trian-
gulation method. Figure 2. (a) and (b) show the 
difference between the triangulation method and 
our co-occurrence count method. 
Furthermore, it is common that a small stand-
ard bilingual corpus can be available between the 
source and target language. The direct translation 
model trained with the standard bilingual corpus 
exceeds in translation performance, but its weak-
ness lies in low phrase coverage. However, the 
pivot model has characteristics characters. Thus, 
it is important to combine the direct and pivot 
translation model to compensate mutually and 
further improve the translation performance. To 
deal with this problem, we propose a mixed 
model by merging the phrase pairs extracted by 
pivot-based method and the phrase pairs extract-
ed from the standard bilingual corpus. Note that, 
this is different from the conventional interpola-
tion method, which interpolates the direct and 
pivot translation model. See Figure 2. (b) and (c) 
for further illustration.

The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. In Section 2, we describe the related 
work. We introduce the co-occurrence count 
method in Section 3, and the mixed model in 
Section 4. In Section 5 and Section 6, we de-
scribe and analyze the experiments. Section 7 
gives a conclusion of the paper. 
2 Related Work 
Several methods have been proposed for pivot-
based translation. Typically, they can be classi-
fied into 3 kinds as follows: 
Transfer Method: The transfer method 
(Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wang et al., 2008; 
Costa-jussà et al., 2011) connects two translation 
systems: a source-pivot MT system and a pivot-
target MT system. Given a source sentence, (1) 
the source-pivot MT system translates it into the 
pivot language, (2) and the pivot-target MT sys-
tem translates the pivot sentence into the target 
sentence. During each step (source to pivot and 
pivot to target), multiple translation outputs will 
be generated, thus a minimum Bayes-risk system 
combination method is often used to select the 
optimal sentence (González-Rubio et al., 2011; 
Duh et al., 2011). The problem with the transfer 
method is that it needs to decode twice. On one 
hand, the time cost is doubled; on the other hand, 
the translation error of the source-pivot transla-
tion system will be transferred to the pivot-target 
translation. 
Synthetic Method: It aims to create a synthet-
ic source-target corpus by: (1) translate the pivot 
part in source-pivot corpus into target language 
with a pivot-target model; (2) translate the pivot 
part in pivot-target corpus into source language 
with a pivot-source model; (3) combine the 
source sentences with translated target sentences 
or/and combine the target sentences with trans-
lated source sentences (Utiyama et al., 2008; Wu 
and Wang, 2009). However, it is difficult to 
build a high quality translation system with a 
corpus created by a machine translation system. 
Triangulation Method: The triangulation 
method obtains source-target phrase table by 
merging source-pivot and pivot-target phrase 
table entries with identical pivot language 
phrases and multiplying corresponding posterior 
probabilities (Wu and Wang, 2007; Cohn and 
Lapata, 2007), which has been shown to work 
better than the other pivot approaches (Utiyama 
and Isahara, 2007). A problem of this approach is 
that the probability space of the source-target 
phrase pairs is non-uniformity due to the mis-
matching of the pivot phrase.  
3 Our Approach 
In this section, we will introduce our method for 
learning a source-target phrase translation model 
with a pivot language as a bridge. We extract the 
co-occurrence count of phrase pairs for each lan-
guage pair with a source-pivot and a pivot-target 
corpus. Then we generate the source-target 
phrase pairs with induced co-occurrence infor-
mation. Finally, we compute translation proba-
bilities using the standard phrase-based SMT 
training method. 
3.1 Phrase Translation Probabilities 
Following the standard phrase extraction method 
(Koehn et al., 2003), we can extract phrase pairs 
???, ???  and ???, ???  from the corresponding word-
aligned source-pivot and pivot-target training 
corpus, where ?? , ??  and ??  denotes the phrase in 
source, pivot and target language respectively. 
Formally, given the co-occurrence count 
????, ??? and ????, ???, we can estimate  ????, ???  by 
Equation 1: 
????, ??? ? ???????, ???, ????, ????
??
 (1) 
where ????  is a function to merge the co-
occurrences count ????, ???  and ????, ??? . We pro-
pose four calculation methods for function ????. 
Given the co-occurrence count ????, ???  and 
????, ???, we first need to induce the co-occurrence 
count ????, ?,? ??? . The ????, ?,? ???  is counted when 
the source phrase, pivot phrase and target phrase 
occurred together, thus we can infer that 
????, ?,? ???  is smaller than ????, ???  and ????, ??? . In 
this circumstance, we consider that ????, ?,? ???  is 
approximately equal to the minimum value of 
????, ??? and ????, ???, as shown in Equation 2. 
????, ??, ??? ? ?min?????, ???, ????, ????
??
 (2) 
Because the co-occurrence count of source-
target phrase pairs needs the existence of pivot 
phrase ?? , we intuitively believe that the co-
occurrence count ????, ???  is equal to the co-
occurrence count ????, ?,? ???. Under this assump-
tion, we can obtain the co-occurrence count 
????, ??? as shown in Equation 3. Furthermore, to 
testify our assumption, we also try the maximum 
value (Equation 4) to infer the co-occurrence 
count of ???, ???  phrase pair. 
1667
????, ??? ? ?min?????, ???, ????, ????
??
 (3) 
????, ??? ? ?max?????, ???, ????, ????
??
 (4) 
In addition, if source-pivot and pivot-target 
parallel corpus greatly differ in quantities, then 
the minimum function would likely just take the 
counts from the smaller corpus. To deal with the 
problem of the imbalance of the parallel corpora, 
we also try the arithmetic mean (Equation 5) and 
geometric mean (Equation 6) function to infer 
the co-occurrence count of source-target phrase 
pairs. 
????, ??? ? ??????, ??? ? ????, ????/2
??
 (5) 
????, ??? ? ??????, ??? ? ????, ???
??
 (6) 
When the co-occurrence count of source-target 
language is calculated, we can estimate the 
phrase translation probabilities with the follow-
ing Equation 7 and Equation 8. 
?????|?? ? ????, ???? ????, ?????  (7) 
????|??? ? ????, ???? ????, ?????  (8) 
3.2 Lexical Weight 
Given a phrase pair ???, ??? and a word alignment 
a between the source word positions ? ? 1,? , ? 
and the target word positions ? ? 0,? ,? , the 
lexical weight of phrase pair ???, ??? can be calcu-
lated by the following Equation 9 (Koehn et al., 
2003). 
??????|?, ?? ??
1
|??|??, ?? ? ??| ? ????|??????,????
?
???
(9) 
The lexical translation probability distribution 
???|?? between source word s and target word t 
can be estimated with Equation 10. 
???|?? ? ???, ??? ????, ????  (10)
To compute the lexical weight for a phrase 
pair ???, ??? generated by ???, ??? and ???, ???, we need 
the alignment information ?, which can be ob-
tained as Equation 11 shows. 
? ? ???, ??|??: ??, ?? ? ??&??, ?? ? ??? (11)
where ??  and ??  indicate the word alignment 
information in the phrase pair ???, ???  and ???, ??? 
respectively. 
4 Integrate with Direct Translation 
If a standard source-target bilingual corpus is 
available, we can train a direct translation model. 
Thus we can integrate the direct model and the 
pivot model to obtain further improvements. We 
propose a mixed model by merging the co-
occurrence count in direct translation and pivot 
translation. Besides, we also employ an interpo-
lated model (Wu and Wang, 2007) by merging 
the direct translation model and pivot translation 
model using a linear interpolation. 
4.1 Mixed Model 
Given ?  pivot languages, the co-occurrence 
count can be estimated using the method de-
scribed in Section 3.1. Then the co-occurrence 
count and the lexical weight of the mixed model 
can be estimated with the following Equation 12 
and 13. 
???, ?? ??????, ??
?
???
 (12)
??????|?, ?? ????
?
???
??,?????|?, ?? (13)
where ????, ??  and ??,?????|?, ??  are the co-
occurrence count and lexical weight in the direct 
translation model respectively. ????, ??  and 
??,?????|?, ?? denote the co-occurrence count and 
lexical weight in the pivot translation model. ?? 
is the interpolation coefficient, requiring 
? ?????? ? 1. 
4.2 Interpolated Model 
Following Wu and Wang (2007), the interpolated 
model can be modelled with Equation 14. 
?????|?? ? ?????????|??
?
???
 (14)
where ??????|?? is the phrase translation probabil-
ity in direct translation model; ??????|??  is the 
phrase translation probability in pivot translation 
model. The lexical weight is obtained with Equa-
tion 13. ?? is the interpolation coefficient, requir-
ing ? ?? ? 1???? .

5 Experiments on Europarl Corpus 
Our first experiment is carried out on Europarl1 
corpus, which is a multi-lingual corpus including 
21 European languages (Koehn, 2005). In our 
work, we perform translations among French (fr), 
German (de) and Spanish (es). Due to the rich-
ness of available language resources, we choose 
English (en) as the pivot language. Table 1 
summarized the statistics of training data. For the 
language model, the same monolingual data ex-
tracted from the Europarl are used. 
The word alignment is obtained by GIZA++ 
(Och and Ney, 2000) and the heuristics “grow-
diag-final” refinement rule (Koehn et al., 2003). 
Our translation system is an in-house phrase-
based system analogous to Moses (Koehn et al., 
2007). The baseline system is the triangulation 
method (Wu and Wang, 2007), including an in-
terpolated model which linearly interpolate the 
direct and pivot translation model.

We use WMT082  as our test data, which con-
tains 2000 in-domain sentences and 2051 out-of-
domain sentences with single reference. The 
translation results are evaluated by case-
insensitive BLEU-4 metric (Papineni et al., 
2002). The statistical significance tests using 
95% confidence interval are measured with 
paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004). 
5.1 Results 
We compare 4 merging methods with the base-
line system. The results are shown in Table 2 and 
Table 3. We find that the minimum method out-
performs the others, achieving significant im-
provements over the baseline on all translation 
directions. The absolute improvements range 
from 0.61 (fr-de) to 1.54 (es-fr) in BLEU% score 
on in-domain test data, and range from 0.36 (fr-
de) to 2.05 (fr-es) in BLEU% score on out-of-
domain test data. This indicates that our method 
is effective and robust in general.

The geometric mean method also achieves im-
provement, but not as significant as the minimum 
method. However, the maximum and the arith-
metic mean methods show a decrement in BLEU 
scores. This reminds us that how to choose a 
proper merging function for the co-occurrence 
count is a key problem.  In the future, we will 
explore more sophisticated method to merge co-
occurrence count. 
5.2 Analysis 
The pivot-based translation is suitable for the 
scenario that there exists large amount of source-
pivot and pivot-target bilingual corpora and only 
a little source-target bilingual data. Thus, we 
randomly select 10K, 50K, 100K, 200K, 500K, 
1M, 1.5M sentence pairs from the source-target 
bilingual corpora to simulate the lack of source-
target data. With these corpora, we train several 
direct translation models with different scales of 
bilingual data. We interpolate each direct transla-
tion model with the pivot model (both triangula-
tion method and co-occurrence count method) to 
obtain the interpolated model respectively. We 
also mix the direct model and pivot model using 
the method described in Section 4.1.  Following

Wu and Wang (2007), we set ?? ? 0.9, ?? ? 0.1, 
?? ? 0.9  and ?? ? 0.1  empirically. The experi-
ments are carried out on 6 translation directions: 
German-Spanish, German-French, Spanish-
German, Spanish-French, French-German and 
French-Spanish. The results are shown in Figure 
3. We only list the results on in-domain test sets. 
The trend of the results on out-of domain test 
sets is similar with in-domain test sets. 
The results are explained as follows: 
(1) Comparison of Pivot Translation and Di-
rect Translation 
The pivot translation models are better than 
the direct translation models trained on a small 
source-target bilingual corpus. With the incre-
ment of source-target corpus, the direct model 
first outperforms the triangulation model and 
then outperforms the co-occurrence count model 
consecutively. 
Taking Spanish-English-French translation as 
an example, the co-occurrence count model 
achieves BLEU% scores of 35.38, which is close 
to the direct translation model trained with 200K 
source-target bilingual data. Compared with the 
co-occurrence count model, the triangulation 
model only achieves BLEU% scores of 33.84, 
which is close to the direct translation model 
trained with 50K source-target bilingual data. 
(2) Comparison of Different Interpolated 
Models 
For the pivot model trained by triangulation 
method and co-occurrence count method, we 
interpolate them with the direct translation model 
trained with different scales of bilingual data. 
Figure 3 shows the translation results of the dif-
ferent interpolated models. For all the translation 
directions, our co-occurrence count method in-
terpolated with the direct model is better than the 
triangulation model interpolated with the direct 
model.  
The two interpolated model are all better than 
the direct translation model. With the increment 
of the source-target training corpus, the gap be-
comes smaller. This indicates that the pivot mod-
el and its affiliated interpolated model are suita-
ble for language pairs with small bilingual data. 
Even if the scale of source-pivot and pivot-target 
corpora is close to the scale of source-target bi-
lingual corpora, the pivot translation model can 
help the direct translation model to improve the 
translation performance. Take Spanish-English-
French translation as an issue, when the scale of 
Spanish-French parallel data is 1.5M sentences 
pairs, which is close to the Spanish-English and 
English-French parallel data, the performance of 
co+mix model is still outperforms the direct 
translation model. 
(3) Comparison of Interpolated Model and 
Mixed Model 
When only a small source-target bilingual 
corpus is available, the mix model outperforms 
the interpolated model. With the increasing of 
source-target corpus, the mix model is close to 
the interpolated model or worse than the interpo-
lated model. This indicates that the mix model 
has a better performance when the source-target 
corpus is small which is close to the realistic sce-
nario. 
5.3 Integrate the Co-occurrence Count 
Model and Triangulation Model 
Experimental results in the previous section 
show that, our co-occurrence count models gen-
erally outperform the baseline system. In this 
section, we carry out experiments that integrates 
co-occurrence count model into the triangulation 
model. 
For French-English-German translation, we 
apply a linear interpolation method to integrate 
the co-occurrence count model into triangulation 
model following the method described in Section 
4.2.  We set ? as the interpolation coefficient of 
triangulation model and 1 ? ? as the interpola-
tion coefficient of co-occurrence count model 
respectively. The experiments take 9 values for 
interpolation coefficient, from 0.1 to 0.9. The 
results are shown in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4: Results of integrating the co-
occurrence count model and the triangulation 
model. 
 
When using interpolation coefficient ranging 
from 0.2 to 0.7, the integrated models outperform 
the triangulation and the co-occurrence count 
model. However, for the other intervals, the inte-

grated models perform slightly lower than the 
co-occurrence count model, but still show better 
results than the triangulation model. The trend of 
the curve infers that the integrated model synthe-
sizes the contributions of co-occurrence count 
model and triangulation model. Additionally, it 
also indicates that, the choice of the interpolation 
coefficient affects the translation performances. 
6 Experiments on Web Data 
The experimental on Europarl is artificial, as the 
training data for directly translating between 
source and target language actually exists in the 
original data sets. Thus, we conducted several 
experiments on a more realistic scenario: trans-
lating Chinese (zh) to Japanese (jp) via English 
(en) with web crawled data. 
As mentioned in Section 3.1, the source-pivot 
and pivot-target parallel corpora can be imbal-
anced in quantities. If one parallel corpus was 
much larger than another, then minimum heuris-
tic function would likely just take the counts 
from the smaller corpus.  
In order to analyze this issue, we manually set 
up imbalanced corpora. For source-pivot parallel 
corpora, we randomly select 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M 
and 5M Chinese-English sentence pairs. On the 
other hand, we randomly select 1M English-
Japanese sentence pairs as pivot-target parallel 
corpora. The training data of Chinese-English 
and English-Japanese language pairs are summa-
rized in Table 4. For the Chinese-Japanese direct 
corpus, we randomly select 5K, 10K, 20K, 30K, 
40K, 50K, 60K, 70K, 80K, 90K and 100K sen-
tence pairs to simulate the lack of bilingual data. 
We built a 1K in-house test set with four refer-
ences. For Japanese language model training, we 
used the monolingual part of English-Japanese 
corpus. 
Table 5 shows the results of different co-
occurrence count merging methods. First, the 
minimum method and the geometric mean meth-
od outperform the other two merging methods 
and the baseline system with different training 
corpus. When the scale of source-pivot and piv-
ot-target corpus is roughly balanced (zh-en-jp-1), 
the minimum method achieves an absolute im-
provement of 2.06 percentages points on BLEU 
over the baseline, which is also better than the 
other merging methods. While, with the growth 
of source-pivot corpus, the gap between source-
pivot corpus and pivot-target corpus becomes 
bigger. In this circumstance, the geometric mean 
method becomes better than the minimum meth-
od. Compared to the minimum method, the geo-
metric mean method considers both the source-
pivot and the pivot-target corpus, which may 
lead to a better result in the case of imbalanced 
training corpus.

Furthermore, with the imbalanced corpus zh-
en-jp-5, we compared the translation perfor-
mance of our co-occurrence count model (with 
geometric mean merging method), triangulation 
model, interpolated model, mixed model and the 
direct translation models. Figure 5 summarized 
the results. 
The co-occurrence count model can achieve an 
absolute improvement of 2.54 percentages points 
on BLEU over the baseline. The triangulation 
method outperforms the direct translation when 
only 5K sentence pairs are available. Meanwhile, 
the number is 10K when using the co-occurrence 
count method. The co-occurrence count models 
interpolated with the direct model significantly 
outperform the other models.

X-axis represents the scale of the standard train-
ing data. 
 
In this experiment, the training data contains 
parallel sentences on various domains. And the 
training corpora (Chinese-English and English-
Japanese) are typically very different, since they 
are obtained on the web. It indicates that our co-
occurrence count method is robust in the realistic 
scenario. 
7 Conclusion 
This paper proposed a novel approach for pivot-
based SMT by pivoting the co-occurrence count 
of phrase pairs. Different from the triangulation 
method merging the source-pivot and pivot-
target language after training the translation 
model, our method merges the source-pivot and 
pivot-target language after extracting the phrase 
pairs, thus the computing for phrase translation 
probabilities is under the uniform probability 
space. The experimental results on Europarl data 
and web data show significant improvements 
over the baseline systems. We also proposed a 
mixed model to combine the direct translation 
and pivot translation, and the experimental re-
sults show that the mixed model has a better per-
formance when the source-target corpus is small 
which is close to the realistic scenario. 
A key problem in the approach is how to learn 
the co-occurrence count. In this paper, we use the 
minimum function on balanced corpora and the 
geometric mean function on imbalanced corpora 
to estimate the co-occurrence count intuitively. 
In the future, we plan to explore more effective 
approaches.
