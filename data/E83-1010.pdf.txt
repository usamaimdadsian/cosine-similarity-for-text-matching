ABSTRACT 
Some Italian sentences related to linguistic 
phenomena largely known and recently discussed by 
many computational linguists are discussed in the 
framework of AT:~. They offer certain difficulties 
which seem to suggest a substantial revision of 
the ATN formalism. The theoretical assumptions and 
an experimental implementation of such a revision 
are presented, together with examples. }:any 
related theoretical points such as some 
psyeholinguistic implications and the relationship 
between deterministic and non-deterministlc 
hypothesis are also briefly discussed. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Certain types of sentences seem to defy the 
abilities of several parsers, and some of them are 
being now discussed by many computational 
linguists, mostly within the deterministic 
hypothesis. 
An exmaination of their treatment within the 
traditional AT\[: paradigm seems to suggest that the 
real discussion is about how to acces the left 
context and what its form should be. 
II. ACCESS TO T}\]E LEFT COfJTEXT 
occurs, the parsing algorith~ suspends the current 
computation and starts a new level of computation. 
Usually, each network recognizes some linguistic 
unit such as Noun Phrase (NP), Prepositional 
Phrase (PP), and Sentence (S) and any recursively 
embedded call to one of them corresponds to a 
level of computation. 
The parsed parts of the input string are 
stored (SETRed) into registers as they are 
recognized. At the end of the network these 
registers are combined (BUILDQed) into a parse 
node and returned (POPed) to the calling net. 
Appropriate functions can return the content of a 
register (GETR) or transfer it to another register 
(combination of SETR with a GETR). This last 
operation is equivalent to i) the renaming of a 
register, if the source register is successively 
set to a different value, i i )  the initialization 
of a register at a lower or higher level, if SENDR 
or LIFTR are used. 
Initialization is co~aonly used to i) raise 
lexical features to a higher level where they are 
used for tests (ex.: subject-verb agreement), ii) 
pass possible antecedents to lower levels where a 
gap may be detected in an embedded clause.

remains unfilled. The same treatment is 
recursively applied to sentences llke 
(2) Giovanni pensava che avrebbe raccontato 
John thought that (he) would have told 
a tutti che aveva fatto una 
to everybody that (he) had done a 
scoperta 
discovery 
where "Giovanni" must serve as subject of both the 
first and the second (linearly) complement. 
Instead, in the sentence 
(3) Giovanni dlsse che i suol colleghl avevano 
John said that his colleagues had 
mentito 
lied 
2. Lexieal features raising 
A storage overload may also be caused by the 
need for raising lexieal features. ~orphological 
features are necessary at the least in the test of 
subject-verb agreement. This is done by LIFTRIng 
in ad hoe registers gender and number from the NP 
level to the S level. If the :;P is popped in a 
possible subject position the test for agreement 
may take place by comparing the content of those 
registers with the corresponding features of the 
verb. However, there are cases such as ex.(1) in 
which such information must be used again in the 
course of the analysis for another (agreement) 
test. Those features must be~ therefore, copied 
in appropriately labelled registers in order to i) 
flag their relation to the subject and ii) prevent 
theln from being erased when the s~ne features are 
LIFTRed from the following NP. 
as the ~:P "i suoi colle~;hi" is analysed, it 
replaces the SENDRed "Giovanni" in the SUBJ 
register and the correct interpretation is popped. 
The same need for ad boc storing may be shown 
for the object and few PP complements. For 
example, in the sentence 
A more complex treatuent is required for the 
sentence 
(4) Giovanni pensava che i suoi colleghi avrebbero 
John thought that his colleagues would 
raccontato a tutti che aveva fatto 
have told to everybody that (|.e) had done 
una scoper ta 
a discovery 
where "Giovanni" must get through the first 
complement and reappear in the second (embedded) 
one. If SENDR is used, a transit re~ister RI with 
the same content as the initialized SUBJ register 
is to be passed down together with it. When the 
subject of the first complement ('i suoi 
colleghi') is found, it replaces "Giovanni" in 
SUEJ but not in RI. The new SUBJ "i suoi 
colleghi" and RI "Giovanni" are again SENDRed to 
the embedded complement where the agreement with 
the verb correctly selects, as subject, the 
content of RI. l~ow, as the number of levels which 
to "jump over" is in principle illlmited and each 
one uay have its own subject to be SENDRed, a 
tra~Isit register for each new subject is needed. 
Thus, for the sentence 
(5) Giovanni era sicuro che i suoi ner,lci 
avrebbero rivelato alla stamps che sua moglie 
avers detto un ;~iorno che l'aveva picchiata(2) 
(6) Ii capitano disse ai soldati che 
The captain said to the soldiers that 
marciavano pietosamente 
(they) were marching peatifully 
as the t!P "i soldati" embedded in the "a-PP" is 
the subject of the complement, its gender and 
nu~iber must travel up through PP and S and down to 
the complement, in order the subject-verb 
agreement to be satisfied. This implies that at a 
given moment other registers containing 
morphological features coexist at the S level with 
those of the subject. 
An obvious remedy to this proliferation of 
registers consists in adding these features to tile 
tiP or PP structure, POPing them, and extracting 
them from those structures when needed. But 
classical ATN does not provide a suitable 
function, a form that should return only a part 
of a stored tree after having searched through it. 
Now, although such functions are not particularly 
complex to design \[5, 7\], they are not perfectly 
consistent with the ATe( general formalism which 
does not take into consideration the extraction of 
pieces of already processed information from the 
structure they have Deen inserted in. 
C. A functional perspective 
when ?recessing< the last corn ple~,~ent three 
re:~isters contaizling the three possible subjects 
will be available and shall be visited in order to 
find the ri~iht one(3). 
i. A generalized retrieving action 
If we look at the discussed exa,,;ples free an 
entirely functional viewpoint ~Je can describe them 
as having in common the need for retrieving 
(2) *John was sure that his enne~,ies would have disclosed to the press that his wife had once told tha't 
(he) ha.:! bested her*. ~,'e give here, for clarity, the parenthesized form of this exmuple: 
(Giovanni era sicuro (che i suol nemlei avrebbero rlvelato alia stamps (ehe sua moglie aveva detto un 
glorno (che l*aveva picchiata))). 
I!otice that in this example the subject-verb agreement is sufficient to select the right antecedent, but 
t|'is is not always the case. 
(3) A possible alternative, equally trlcky,is the use of the HOLD-VIRT couple. 
59 
information somewhere back in the already built 
structures; the tricky solutions presented above 
are, in fact, a way of accessing parts of the left 
context. These sometimes correspond to the entire 
content of a register and sometimes to a fragment 
of it. 
We will assume, then, that the left context is 
stored in a space o f  memory, equally accessible 
from any level and that retrieving always concerns 
fragments of it. At any point of the process this 
structure contains the current hypothesis about 
the analysis of the parsed segment of the input 
from the beginning; hence we will refer to it as 
Current Global Hypothesis (CGH). 
The retrieving action will have two participants, 
a symbol that triggers the action (trig£er) and 
the infomnation to be retrieved (the target of the 
action). 
In this frame all the different procedures 
discussed above may be reduced to a single general 
algorithm of three steps, 
i) identification of a t r l~er  (a gap to be 
filled, a verb uhich demands for the subject-verb 
agreement test) 
ii) extraction of constraints which ::~ust guide the 
search for the target, and 
iii) retrieving of the required inforuation. 
On this functional ground, the same 
description fits to the binding of an anaphoric 
pronoun to its antecedent \[7\] as in 
(7) a) Giovanni disse a harla che voleva 
John said to .~ary that (he) wanted 
sposarl-la 
marry her 
as opposed to 
b) Giovanni dlsse a llaria che voleva 
John said to ~!ary that (he) ~lanted 
sposarsi 
to marry 
The function that searches back may be 
constrsined by several types of restrlctlons, 
includin~ i) morphological features, i.e. the 
gender and number of the pronoun or those required 
for agreement by the syntactic environment (e.g. 
the verb), ll) syntactic idiosyncrasies of soue 
lexical Ite~:~ such as the STRA~S verbs that 
determine which of their arguments is to be the 
subject of the couplement, ill) seLlautic features 
that may be introduced in the process, and iv) 
syntactic deter,-.inat ion of the scope of the 
search. 
2. .!anipulations of the left context 
I\[et rieving of the antecedent nay actually 
correspond to two different operations depending 
upon ~hether the antecedent to be bound li~Learly 
preceeds or follows the syubol it is to be bound 
to. 
In the cases discussed abovu the gap or the 
pronoun always follow there antecedent and it is 
therefore possible to i~ ,:~edia tel y insert the 
binding pointer. \[\[oreover, in many comon sentences 
the antecedent linearly follows its dependent, as 
in 
(8) 
(9) 
Quando si arrabbia, Giovanni diventa rosso 
When (he) gets angry, John becomes red 
Se io vedi, saluta Giovanni 
If (you) see him, say hallo to John 
da parte mia 
on my behalf 
In this case, the binding should take place in 
two steps, the flagging of the need for a forward 
binding and the moving of the pointer from the 
antecedent, once detected, to the flag. Notice 
that this class of sentences entirely lies beyond 
the abilities of the classical ATi~ framework. 
Relative pronouns also need to be bound to an 
antecedent and, besides, are the surface signal of 
an embedding. ~:o special processing difficulty is 
proposed by sentences like 
(i0) Ii ra~azzo ehe corre 
The boy who runs 
where the relative pronoun occurs exactly ~here 
the embedding begins. In this case a scope 
restriction can limit the search for an antecedent 
to the imI.~ediately preceeding \[~P. 
But in the sentences 
(ii) II ragazzo del quale ti parlmvo 
The boy about whom I was talkin3 to you 
(12) Ii ragazzo del cui padre ti parlavo 
The boy about whose fati~er I uas talking 
to you 
the relative clause boundery is set one word 
before the relative pronoun, and in 
(13) Ii ragazzo del padre del quale 
The boy about the father of whom: 
ti parlavo 
was talking to you 
where the phenomenon known as pied-plping occurs, 
such a boundery may be located several words 
before the relative pronoun. 
In an AT!~ these cases ~:eet the initial set of 
arcs ~hich recognize a PP e~,bedded iu an NP, as iu 
(14) il ragazzo dell'nscensore 
t~e boy of the lift 
anti the correct interpretatiot~ is obtained only by 
backtracking (for ii and 12) aad again usinb a set 
of transit registers (for \]2). ~o solution is 
known for sentence (13). 
In the frame~'ork we have been discussin,~ an 
action ~Jhich structurally ~iodifies the left 
context can be proposed. It should e~,:Sed the 
c~llponent(s) being: \[,rocessed in a relative clause 
as the relative pronoun in met. 
60 
A third type of access to the left context is 
the relabelling of a processed component, already 
used for the passive transfon~ation. 
III. EXPF.~ I~IE,~TAL I~d'LEF,'ENTATIO;I 
A. General assumptions 
\[~ost of the above discussion is based on our 
own experience with an ATN parser, although valid 
also for other parsers. Some of the linguistic 
phenomena we are trying to functionally classify 
have been recently discussed in the frame of the 
detenainistic parsing and sou, e progress in the 
treatment of those sentences has been done. 
However ~Je prefer to stick to the 
non-deten:~inistic hypothesis, because no valuable 
ar~;ument seems to stand against ti~e idea of AT~ as 
a collection of alternative heuristic strateEies 
representing those used in the human sentence 
processing. On the contrary it is possible to 
introduce in an ATN parser some mechanism for 
selecting strategies in function of a text or a 
sublangua;~e \[Ii\]. 
Our assumption is, then, that the possibility 
of backtracking must be kept, but restricted by 
i. introducing linsuistic coDstraints to guide the 
choice of alternatives; 
ii. manipulating the left context in some cases in 
which backtracking can be intuitively charged on 
inadequacies of the parser rather than on points 
of real linguistic ambiguity. 
A second assumption more related to the 
current implementation of the system refers to the 
grammatical fomnalisn. A functional representation 
a la \['..Kay \[i~\] is used. A detailed explanation 
of this fonaalis:~ is not necessary to the 
understanding of this paper. It is enough to know 
that its \];asic unit is the attribute-value pair, 
wk,ere an attribute is a symbol (label) and a value 
is a symbol or another functional description. In 
the sentence 
(15) l le killed her 
a possible pair is SUEJ=he, or SUBJ=HEAD=he 
together with SUBJ=CAT=PRON etc. Any sequence of 
sy~nbols is a path leading to a value; thus the 
value of SUI;J=:IEAD is "he'. 
The functions that access the data structure 
are specifically desi.~;ned to treat this type of 
representation but ~.,e think that they could be 
easily Feneralizcd. The ter-n "component" will be 
used to identify the get of paths startin;; fro,~ 
the sa:ae lal;el (radix). 
The reasons of this choice are as follows: 
i. addressim: frabments of information is more 
easily done by follo~,In~: a path of labels than by 
visiting; a unlabellcd tree; 
ii. functional grammar allows any depth of 
linguistic representatiou through the left 
adjunction of labels; 
iii. functional syntactic repeseutation and 
lexical features (also expressed in tenas of 
attribute- value pairs) ;~ay be treated in a 
uniform way. 
B. The parser 
The basic features of the ATN :~,arser used in 
our previous experi~aents \[19\], i.e. the network 
formalism and the parsing algoritl~a, are kept, 
while the data structure and the whole set of 
actions and forms have been modified. Also the use 
of the push-down mechanisn~ has been ,modified to 
some extent. 
The data structure is a list which is mainly 
accessed wittl a typical LIFO stack policy. It 
represents a unique memory space non splitted into 
registers. The state saving mechanism necessary 
for the treatraent of non-detenainism is provided 
by XD-LISP \[2,17\], the dialect of LISP in which 
the system is written. At any point in which 
non-determinism is called, the previous context, 
in particular the data, is saved and only the new 
values are set in the current context. Therefore, 
there is no difference between the use of the 
traditional register table and this special list 
since both of them are handled in the same way. 
This (LIFO) list contains at any point of the 
process the CGI', i.e. the entire left context 
literally represented in ten,~s of attribute-value 
pairs. 
We give hereafter a llst in Backus notation of the 
functions which access the CCH.

The basic storing action is AD!' which is used 
to store any iucor,ing piece of structure. The 
string 
(16) il cane 
the dog 
recognized by ti,e network 
61 
is stored by the following actions 
I. (AI.D (DET *)) 
2. (ADD (P.EAD *)) 
If location is NIL, the  current co(,~ponent is 
meant, otherwise the form LOCATE specifies the 
path leading to the radix to which the new \[,air is 
to be ADDed. 
Pelabelling of a component is done by the action 
ASSIGNS. In the sentences 
(16a) Ii cane u:any, ia 
the doz eats 
(-16b) Ii cane e ° mangiato 
the dot~ is eaten 
the NP "il cane" will be first labelled FOCUS or 
FIIISTXP. Then, after having rico?,nized the verb, 
the action 
(ASSIC~! SUBJ (LOCATE FOCUS T CL T)) or 
(ASSIP:G OSJ (LOCATE FOCUS T CL T)) 
will properly classify the ;!P as 
SUBJ or OBJ = FOCUS = DET= IL 
=HEAD =' 2! = CA~:E 
F, xtraction of inforuation is done by the forms 
FI!$D, which returns a pair, and FINDVAL, which 
returns only the value of a pair. LOCATE works 
exactly in the same way, but returns a pointer to 
a Liven radix. All the three functions can work in 
different modes. They can search either only the 
current level (CL) or throu;,h the entire list (T). 
In this latter case the current level is excluded 
and, if no further options are specified, the 
lower (the nearest to the top) occurrence is 
returned. Another option (dtype) returns all the 
occurrences either appen,}ed in a list (L) or one 
"y one, non-deter:,inistieally (UD). ,' third optio1~ 
evaluates conditions in order to select the 
cn;~pohent i~entified by the specified path. 
in sentence (4) t;.c antecc;\]eut retrievin~3 is 
,erfor::e? ky t~e for,., 
(FI\[,IDVAL (SUB J) (AND (gq (FI;~EVAL (Sg~J /:el!) T T 
:m) 
(FII,'DVt~L (IUgAD I;UZ)T EL 
r)) 
(EQ (\[:I'~r;VAL (SUhj GEl,) T T 
~ID) 
(FILq)VAL (::EAb GF+: O T CL 
T))) T ND) 
which searches for a subject t hrou,%h all the 
levels non detem~tinistically. Such an ?\[P must 
agree in nuanber and gender with the current level 
head, i°e. the verb(4). If this expression is 
embedded in the function 
(ADD SUBJ ) 
the correct subject(s) is (are) cOpiEd in the 
compleuent (5). 
The three last actions, PUSI!, POP, and I:~S\]:'.P,T, 
manipulate the items in the list. PUSX adds a nee 
(empty) ite:,t in front of the list. The elements of 
the co~ponent being analysed (phrases or 
sentences) are ADDed it~ this top item, which has 
been therefore referred to as current level. POP 
re.coves the current top-ite+~ and e.:beds it into 
the ne~¢ top-item, possibly ~ssidning a label to 
the corresL;.onding co;aponent. Finally li!Si2~T 
inserts an itei,, cor respond in  to ~: nu:: level, 
so+mubere back between "ite+a" an:! the front part 
of the list, and fills it ~ith "data'. 
List ~anipulation takes place independently from 
the starting or the ending of the process 
expressed in a subnet. Thus a eo+aponent can be 
POPed after the end of its recognition procedure, 
wben also its function is clarified. 
The are recognizing an object, for ex., can be 
expressed as follows 
(START NP T 
(COND (FI::I?+ (SITBj) T CL T) 
(POP OBJ)) 
(TO qi)) 
which means that if there already is a subject, 
the current couponent must be popped with the 
label OBJ. 
The use of the IESERT function is primarily 
motivated by the treatment of certain relative 
clauses. Felative pronouns arc surface sijnals 
that tridger the embedding into ~, relativ~ clau~e 
of tim currently processed co.+q,oncnt(s). 
In the sentenc¢~ 
(17)11 libro della tra;,,a del quale i,arlava:to

(5) ;~e do not intend to su:..cst that the correct mechanism of trace/antecedent b ind lu  is the co\[:yin of 
tle antecedent in the trace position. A slizhtly modified version of this function ni;;itt produce the 
insertion of the antecedent path, as in the orthodox functional grat~\[,,ar. The proccduL'e, ho~Jever, does llot 
substantially chanzc. 
62 
(Ig) (il libro (RELCL (della trams (del quale)) 
parlavamo)) 
The general rule may be formulated as follows: 
"a new level labelled ~ELATIVECb\USE is to be 
inserted immediately after the antecedent of the 
relative prottoun'. Analysis of (17) will therefore 
proceed as follows;  
- when the relative pronoun "quale" is 
encountered, the for;n 
(FIND (HEAD) (AND (Et\] (FINDVAL (HEAD GEN) T T ~:D) 
(FINDVAL (DET GEN) T CL T)) 
(EQ (FINDVAL (HEAD N~)  r T ND) 
(FINDVAL (bET N~)  r CL T))) 
T T) 
no substantial difference exists in comparison 
with the traditional register access. In the 
discussed complex cases the access to the CGII is a 
known function of the length of the list, i.e. of 
the depth of embedding of tlle current level. 
Within any item search proceeds linearly as for 
any ordinary pattern-matching. 
The only substantially ne~ fact is the 
possibility of embedding the current component; 
this eliminates the need for backtracking, at 
least for some sentences. 
In conclusion, it seems that if there is a 
difference from the traditional ATN it is in 
favour of the version presented here. 
returns the lower head ~hich agrees in number and 
gender with the determiner of "quale" ('quale" is 
both masculine and feminine), i.e. "llbro'. This 
is the antecedent. 
- The function 
(liggEtT ~ELCL (LOCATE...as for FIND)) 
inserts a new ite~+t with label :~.ELCL. 
- On the saree arc the function (POP DI-AI~G) embeds 
"del quale" in "della trams" and a second POP 
embeds (della tra,~a (del quale)) in the recently 
inserted relative clause co~:~ponent. 
- The recognition of a relative clause is 
continued by a (STA;~.T S .... ) arc. The control is 
finally then returned to the I,~P process with the 
con'.plex I~'V "il libro...'as the current component. 
B. Generalization and modularity 
The set of actions and forr~s presented seem to 
provide a functional descril;tion of many 
linguistic pheno~nena. They can be regarded as 
linguistic (procedural) generalizations, at least 
on the functional y~round. This supports our claim 
that linguistic pheno~:~ena can be described, 
in~lepen~ently fro~ tbc fon;~alisu that expresses 
them ( the grammar), in ter~.is of general 
operations. This set of operations is open- ended 
and can, therefore, be increased with functions 
designed for the treatment of new phenomena, as 
they are discussed and described. Furthermore, 
those actions can be taken to represent nlental 
operations of the language user, thus providing a 
valuable frame for psycLolinguistic experiments. 
IV. ADVA~:TAGES 
A. Efficiency 
The parser we have been presenting is based on 
the core algorithm of the AT~J. Our modifications 
affect the set of for, us and actions and the data 
structure. The parsin~ algorithu~, therefore, keeps 
the efficiency of traditional ATE. We have already 
shown that the storing of the data structure does 
not present any special difference from the 
traditional re:~isters syste~, even in relation to 
the treatL~ent of non-determini~l. The r,:emory load 
is. therefore, strictly a function of tile length 
of the parsed se:_,L::ent of the input an(\] no overhead 
determined by t~anipulations of structures is added 
as in the case of transit registers. 
The actiol~s an,! fom~s are equivalent to the 
tra~?itional ones, but for the fact that \[~ost of 
tile.., :Lust visit the t~holc left context for every 
access. ~.~y:;ay this effec~ hardly l,alances the 
s~tting of transit re~,+isters. In fact, it is 
~;or th noting: that in the ~lajority of comrlon 
sentences such accesses are very reduced, go that 
It is obvious that this view strongly inclines 
towards the idea of parser as a collection of 
heuristic strategies and processes and also offers 
a aye,|metric alternative to the HOLD hypothesis. 
According to thls hypothesis there are points in a 
sentence in which comprehension needs a heavier 
memory load; instead in our view an overhead of 
operations is suggested. Anyway the distinguished 
phenomena coincide, thus keeping the inte~rity of 
the experimental data(6). 
C. Naturallty 
Our hypothesis seems more natural in t~.,o ~Jays. 
It embeds into a non-detemninistic frame so~+e 
operations very similar to some of those designed 
and discussed in the deterlnini.'~tlc hypotilesis \[3, 
4, 15, 16, 19\]. The result is a strong limitation 
of the effects of non-determinism, at least for 
those cases they are desigue~t to treat. It is 
interesting that starting from two opposed 
viewpoints co~aparable resul t'~ are obtaine~t. 
i~evertheless, as stated above, we tt~ink that 
imposing constraints to a non-deterministic :,:odel 
is ::io re natural than being: imposed ~ lobal 
constraints by the assu~q)tiou of ti~termiuism. Irt 
the first hypothesis, in fact, a deter~inistic 
behaviour of the ~,arser ;~a~ ~e ulti; ~ately 
(u) In this t)aragra;,h we refer to the ideas and the experiments presentec by Kaplan \[12, 13\] and IJanner & 
::arm|sos \[21\].

obtained, in som~ points, as a result of 
observation of real linguistic restrictions while 
~h~e phenomena such as amhlgulty which can be 
adequately treated only in a non-de£er~inistic 
frame, are not "a priori" ruled out. Then, a 
model such as the non-detem~inistic one, in which 
there is place for the study of human heuristic 
constraints, seems more attractive and natural. 
Our hypothesis seems intuitively natural also 
in so much as it tries to propose a "theory of 
guess ~. During the comprehension of a sentence 
guesses (CGII's) are progressively enriched and 
stored in a space of memory. During this process 
errors may he done. For some of them it is enough 
to ,aodify the previous guess while for others a 
real backtracking and reanalysis is necessary. 
Although the distinction between the two types of 
errors is unclear, it provides a valuable frame 
for further research in the domain of 
computational linguistics as well as 
psycholinguisties. In \[>articular it seems to 
distim3uish in the activity of sentence 
comprehension a phase of structuring from a phase 
of perception. Errors occurring in t~,e former are 
remedied by ~nodifyin~ a guess, while those 
occurring in the latter need baektrackin~ and the 
choice of another strategy. 
V  PERSPECTIVES 
A more serious systematization of the proposed 
functions, as well as the extension of the model 
to ~ore and more llnguistic phenomena are obvious 
extensions of the present project. 
Another direction where investigation seems to 
be particularly fruitfull is the relation between 
syntax and ser.:antics. On one hand, the fact that 
the result of the analysis is progressively stored 
in a unique space of uemory :lo not it:pose special 
constraints on the structure of the analyzed 
strin~. On the other hand, many of the presented 
functions include parameter slots for conditions 
which may be filled with any kind of test. This 
t~odel see:qs, therefore, to avoid "physiological" 
bounderies between syntax and semantics. The 
stored structure can be a semantic one and the 
tests can also incorporate se~;.antic descriptions. 
This seems to eventually lead to an easier 
integration of the two levels, h~e will present 
shortly \[i0\] a first approxi~.ation to a frame into 
which such in inte~ration can be realized.
